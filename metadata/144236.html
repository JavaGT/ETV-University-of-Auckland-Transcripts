From the best Hawke's Bay lamb, kai cooked in the thermal waters of Rotorua's Tikitere to a protein-heavy hangi and kaimoana pulled straight from the pristine waters off the Coromandel Peninsula, Matheson tastes the best the country has to offer, and learns about the effects of colonisation on tangata whenua and their culinary traditions. 
He even finds time and space on his skin for a traditional ta moko. 

About the Series:
Boisterous chef Matty Matheson isn't picky about what he eats -- he'll eat a $6 sub at a gas station, then later in the day eat a meal made from some of the most expensive, sought-after ingredients available. Now, the Toronto-based chef is combining his love of food and adventure as he heads across his native Canada -- and beyond -- to experience some of the foods made by his fellow countrymen and international chefs, whether they're closer to cheap gas-station eats or delicacies at five-star establishments. Matheson, along with new and old friends, eats a variety of foods that he encounters on his journey.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science, New Zealand, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VICELAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
