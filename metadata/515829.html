Digging a little further, they discovered that 15 million kg of headphones are thrown away every year due to fixable mechanical faults or due to technology advances. 

Their solution is a startup wit the ambition to become the world's leading circular economy audio brand - Gerrard Street. The headphones that they have created are designed to be fully modular (can be assembled in less than one minute), to be the most durable in the industry, and are sold only on a service contract (you cannot buy them).

Watch them assemble and showcase the headphones live during Summit 2019 with the Foundation's Miranda Schnitger asking them about their sources of inspiration and what's next.

Thank you for watching this video. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a UK charity working on business, learning, insight &amp; analysis, and communications to accelerate the transition towards the circular economy.
