After some early morning high-jinks, the boys set off for work picking tomatoes at a nearby market garden. After church outdoors on Sunday, the boys head for a swimming hole in the Waimea River and burn up what's left of their energy in a game of tennis ball rugby. 02.50 Italian Campaign, Roads to the Winter Front: New Zealand transport drivers in Southern Italy are taking men and supplies forward for the important push across the Sangro River. The convoys pass ancient hilltop towns and across new bridges built to replace the ones destroyed by the retreating enemy. Allied guns make sure the German troops don't retreat in comfort. The Allies and UN forces roll into a town that the Germans recently vacated after blowing up some key buildings. Heavy equipment is moved up for the final assault on the German winter line and now the guns are firing beyond it. Allied forces cross the Sangro on bridges built by New Zealanders during the fiercest fighting. Soldiers mop up the last enemy troops left in Castelfrentano and the Winter Line.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
