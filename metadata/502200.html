With extraordinary intimacy, the camera nestles in with the women of the Yarchen Monastery, who, during the 100 coldest days of the year, learn about-and in some cases experience-profound matters of life and death, suffering and healing, karma and consequence. A document of the experiences of a group of increasingly politically embattled people, Jin Huaqing's film is also a clarifying work of faith and philosophical inquiry, set against a forbidding landscape.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:26:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-07-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
