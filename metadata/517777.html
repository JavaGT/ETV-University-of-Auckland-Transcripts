Golf has long been associated with exclusivity, wealth and privilege. From its origins among the Scottish upper class, golfers need the time to play, and enough wealth to afford the sometimes hefty club fees. But not in the small rural town of Opotiki. There, the local club does all it can to accommodate aspiring youngsters from all sorts of backgrounds. It's all part of a cunning plan by humble local Mickey Huriwaka to get the kids off their phones and out on to the greens, practising discipline, social skills and their swing - with impressive results.
