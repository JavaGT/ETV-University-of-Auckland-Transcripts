With chef Sophie Grigson.

Giles Coren and Sue Perkins spend the week on the diet of a wealthy Edwardian Couple. Cooking for them at home is best selling cookery writer Sophie Grigson. Enormous amounts of offal, game, red meats and eggs are consumed from breakfast to late night snacks. Over the week they have a 9 course dinner party with guest including Roy Hattersley, an authentic 1905 society banquet attended by Anton Mosimann at The Savoy, and go on the little known chew chew diet. Overwhelmed by the amounts they have to eat - over 5,000 calories a day - Sue and Giles knock back the alcohol, play practical jokes and find themselves constipated for most of the week.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:06:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science, History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
