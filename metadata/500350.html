This colossal particle accelerator - 27 kilometers in circumference - is the most powerful accelerator in the world. Large-scale experiments, such as the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) with over 2,000 participating physicists and engineers, are required to detect and analyze the debris of sub-atomic particles that will be produced when the two LHC proton beams undergo head-on collisions. &lt;br&gt;
Such collisions will generate a very harsh radiation environment around the collision point, so a radiation monitoring system must be developed. The system is called the Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and will consist of a number of small radiation detectors constructed of Chemical Vapour Deposited (CVD) diamond. &lt;br&gt; 
At Auckland University, researchers are examining the unique properties of diamond detectors that will protect the CMS experiment should the proton beams go astray. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Professor David Krofcheck, Dr. Richard Gray, Rex Chang and Deryk Lin from the University of Auckland.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2006-12-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
