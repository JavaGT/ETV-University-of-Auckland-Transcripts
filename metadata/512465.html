<tr><td align='left' valign='top'>etv/_plastik_a_short_fil_20230731_1147</td><td  align='left' valign='top'>(PLASTIK) - A short film to end plastic pollution in South-East Asia</td><td align='left' valign='top'>&lsquo;(PLASTIK)&rsquo; is a short film developed by MeshMinds and Studio Birthplace, inviting audiences to view the plastic pollution crisis through the eyes and imagination of a child in South-East Asia. The film follows the child experiencing hyper-realistic glimpses into a plastic-polluted future through the lens of a plastic bottle &lsquo;telescope&rsquo;, using creative storytelling and thought-provoking scenes, to raise awareness and catalyse action to end plastic pollution in the region.

Objective
The objective of (PLASTIK) is to visually narrate, particularly in a South-East Asian context, the social implications of plastic pollution; increase empathy for the crisis; and activate emotions that will drive behavioural change amongst youth in the region to say no to single-use plastic. 

Sustainable Practices During Film Production
The film was shot in Sepang, Malaysia. Studio Birthplace provided meals without the use of single-use plastics and required the crew to use their own reusable water bottles, while opting for digital call-sheets and scripts. Carbon emissions from transportation during the shoot days are calculated and compensated 150% through tree planting.

(PLASTIK) was developed by MeshMinds and Studio Birthplace, and was launched on World Environment Day in partnership with the UN Environment Programme and SEA circular.
