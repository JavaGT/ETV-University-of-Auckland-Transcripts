Journalists sign letter alleging pro-Israeli reporting and and dehumanisation of Palestinians.
The world&rsquo;s television screens, newspapers and online media have been filled with pictures of Israel&rsquo;s war on Gaza.

More than 11,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed so far.

They&rsquo;ve also featured the October 7 Hamas attacks in southern Israel, which the authorities there say killed about 1,200 people.

Modern technology means there&rsquo;s more media coverage than ever before, but some of it has been criticised &ndash; by journalists themselves.

Hundreds of them have signed a letter accusing Western media of biased reporting of the Gaza war.

Are the allegations fair?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:39</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-11-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
