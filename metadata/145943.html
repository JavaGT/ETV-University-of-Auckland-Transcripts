About series:
Wally Trollman is an adventurous 6-year-old troll with a power that lets him make words come to life using a magic stick. Wally uses those words to transform the world around him by creating objects that start with the same letter as the first letter in the word he has animated -- such as creating a castle and catapult out of words that begin with C. Wally uses his magic for more than fun, though; he uses it to solve problems, help friends, and overcome the antics of resident troublemaker Bobgoblin. But the young troll must be careful because his magic stick sometimes creates unexpected results that can make the entire forest go dark or send his house galloping away. Going with Wally on his adventures are pet dragon Norville and friends Gina Giant, Ogre Doug and Libby Light Sprite.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:22:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Education & Teaching</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NICKELODEON</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-09-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>05:55:00</td></tr></table>
