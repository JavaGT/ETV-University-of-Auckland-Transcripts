They also highlight the personal struggles of the artist.
The series features new and lengthy interviews with key performers, their colleagues explaining what really happened in the studio and after the gigs. Some of these stories are peppered with new performances recorded especially for the show and the artists reveal alternative mixes and early versions of songs that have become part of the national heritage.
These documentaries place the albums in their artistic, historical and cultural context. The chemistry of the group was an integral part of its work and this film goes into the relationships that made the 'The Go-Betweens' in considerable depth. We also investigate the songs; especially the melodic chemistry which has made songs like 'Streets of Your Town' classics. The album '16 Lovers Lane' encapsulates all those qualities that made the 'The Go-Betweens' great: love, adventure, courage, idiosyncrasy, honesty. In its grooves is the history of one of Australia's national treasures.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Design, Media Studies, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-12-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:30:00</td></tr></table>
