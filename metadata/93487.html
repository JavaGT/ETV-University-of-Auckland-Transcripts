When Michael makes the mistake of getting Arthur on line, he ends up being mistaken for a murderer.

About Count Arthur Strong
We return to the corner-cafe world of Count Arthur Strong (Steve Delaney), a faded star from the golden days of variety, who was never as famous as he thinks he was or thinks he still is.

While he always believes another great entertainment triumph is only a phone call away, until that call comes, Arthur spends his days making the most of any chance that comes along; one day he's a Living Statue, the next a painter/decorator/ burglar.

Over the course of the series he writes an erotic novel for the over-70s in a weekend, stands for election to try and get a new hat and steals an aeroplane.

Into these schemes is once again pulled a ragtag band of accomplices, including reluctant Michael (Rory Kinnear Penny Dreadful, Skyfall, Lucan), the son of Arthurs old comedy partner Max.

Michaels mild-mannered exasperation at Arthurs schemes doesnt stop him returning to the cafe... drawn by his affection for Arthur, and his love for Sinem, sister of irascible Bulent who cant bear the sight of idiot man Arthur in his cafe...where Arthur leads, pandemonium always follows.
