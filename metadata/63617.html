Behind them was a large projection of the clothes they were wearing -- so that onlookers could see the innermost details. In fact, this collection was full of optical illusions -- things were never quite as they appeared -- including the clothes themselves, which included colorful floral prints, unique pinstripe suiting in a casual vibe, and zippers that were not what you would normally expect.  But isn't that the essence of a JPG collection anyway?
