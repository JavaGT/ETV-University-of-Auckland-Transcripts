Ade Adepitan is in Germany as it marks 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. He meets some punks who defied the East German authorities in the 1980s and an artist building a commemorative 'wall of unification'. We also catch up with the first All-Female Injured and Sick team to compete in a gruelling bicycle race across the USA and Cat Moh swims in some of the world's clearest waters in Iceland.

Join the team on their journey of discovery as they explore new destinations around the globe and uncover hidden sides to some of the world's favourite holiday hotspots.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-11-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:30:00</td></tr></table>
