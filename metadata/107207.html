Her bedroom hasn&rsquo;t changed since she was three, and she thinks it is time for the ballerinas and Winnie the Pooh to go. An avid reader, she wanted a space she could retreat to, and desperately wanted more storage in her small room.

Brianna&rsquo;s submitted design included a scale drawing, a list of her preferred Resene paint colours and even a pallet bed design.
