The origin story behind Commissioner James Gordon's rise to prominence in Gotham City in the years before Batman's arrival.

About Gotham:
Before there was Batman, there was GOTHAM.

With a reputation synonymous with law and order, Commissioner James Gordon is one of the crime world's greatest foes. Everyone knows the name. But what is known of Gordon's rise from rookie detective to Police Commissioner? And what did it take to navigate the layers of corruption that secretly ruled Gotham City, the spawning ground of the world's most iconic villains -- the larger-than-life personas who would become Catwoman, The Penguin, The Riddler, Two-Face and The Joker?

GOTHAM is the origin story of the great DC Comics Super-Villains and vigilantes, revealing an entirely new chapter that has never been told. From executive producer/writer Bruno Heller (The Mentalist, Rome), this one-hour drama follows one cop's rise through a dangerously corrupt city teetering on the edge of evil and chronicles the genesis of one of the most popular super heroes of our time.

Brave, earnest and eager to prove himself, the newly minted detective Gordon (Ben McKenzie) is partnered with the brash, but shrewd police legend Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue)</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:06:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Information Technology, Science, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-09-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
