Seven years after suffering a mental breakdown during a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the New Burbage Festival, Geoffrey Tennant is struggling to make ends meet, managing the dilapidated Theatre Sans Argent (Theatre Without Money). Oliver Welles, still the artistic director at the festival, is mounting his tenth identical production of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', and is worried that he has lost his creative edge. Richard Smith-Jones, general manager of the festival, attempts to save the funding as their sponsor, 'Lenstrex', goes through a change of management. The new Lenstrex liaison, Holly Day, seems interested in the festival, and in Richard. Kate McNab, an actress making her debut in the play, is shocked that her high school drama teacher wants to give up his teaching career to act in the festival.

'Slings &amp; Arrows' is a Canadian TV series set at the fictional 'New Burbage Festival', a Shakespearean festival similar to the real-world Stratford Festival. The program stars Paul Gross, Stephen Ouimette and Martha Burns.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:44:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-12-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:00:00</td></tr></table>
