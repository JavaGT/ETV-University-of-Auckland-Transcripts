Everyone celebrates Thanksgiving at Mrs. Wolowitz's house, though she is laid up in bed, so Raj, Bernadette and Amy do the cooking. Penny mentions a Thanksgiving she had in Las Vegas with Zack Johnson, joking about how they had a &quot;fake&quot; wedding. Her friends tell her that the wedding was real and that she is legally married, causing tension between her and Leonard. Howard tries in vain to bond with his father-in-law, Mike, who instead starts to bond with Sheldon over football; it turns out that Sheldon has considerable football knowledge, as he was forced to watch the game with his father as a child.

After Mike shares beers with Sheldon, they continue to hit it off. A now-drunk Sheldon gestures to Amy and says to Mike, &quot;Ain't she great?&quot;, then swats her on the rear and suggests she get them more beers. Amy is shocked, but delighted at the physical attention. Meanwhile, Penny has invited Zack over to sign the annulment papers to end their marriage. Zack is at first reluctant to sign, saying he is worried about how ending the marriage will affect their non-existent kids. Penny demands that he sign, which he does. Mike finally compliments Howard, but then attributes his kindness to being drunk. Penny and Leonard reconcile.

'The Big Bang Theory' is an American sitcom. The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
