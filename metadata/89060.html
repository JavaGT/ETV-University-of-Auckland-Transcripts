Ton and Allen face their toughest challenge yet when two old rivals join forces. The guys dig up an off-road motorcycle and a pair of net guns, while the staff clashes with mystery shoppers back at Haff Ton Pawn.

From Brooklyn to Anchorage, from New Orleans to Hawaii, Auction Hunters follows Allen Haff and Ton Jones as they traverse the country in search of treasure hidden in storage units. 

Every year in America, 50,000 storage facilities hold auctions for abandoned storage units. Each unit has the potential to be a goldmine or a bust for those who make their living hunting unclaimed property. 

Auction Hunters cuts the lock and opens the door into high stakes, financial risks and potential rewards where the right purchase can bring in serious cash.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:26:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Economics</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-09-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:00:00</td></tr></table>
