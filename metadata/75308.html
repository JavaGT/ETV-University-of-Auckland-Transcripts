While most eight-year-olds pester their parents for a new toy, a trip to the movies or a digital device, Mount White Station's Mark Smith had a different birthday present in mind. Mark was desperate to take his pony on the Canterbury high country station's annual cattle muster - and when he got his wish, a Country Calendar crew went with him. According to his dad, station manager Richard Smith, the youngster had been pleading for over a year to join him and the other stockmen on the four-day muster. Older brother Ben, now nine, went last year. &quot;Mark's been working on us ever since.&quot; 

Mum Sheri Smith was philosophical about the dangers of sending her eight-year-old into the back country. She says Mark is a confident rider and she was comfortable about his safety, knowing he was in the hands of capable men. &quot;To be honest I'm more worried about him crossing the highway at Springfield than I am about him going on the muster.&quot; Mt White Station is a massive 50,000 hectares of classic Canterbury high country in the vast watershed of the Waimakariri River, east of Arthur's Pass. The country is so big that before each muster Richard Smith over-flies the mustering beats in his plane, checking on the location of stock. &quot;It's a huge saving in time. Knowing where the animals are can shave days off the muster once we're on the ground.&quot; 

But despite that head start, the musterers still faced long days in the saddle. Just getting to the first hut is a 30km ride. They rose around 5.30 am, every day, tucked in to a full cooked breakfast, saddled their horses, gathered up their dogs and were out on their beats well before sunrise. If young Mark Smith is hard to wake on school mornings, the Country Calendar team found he showed no sign of it on the muster. He was up with the rest of the men, made a good fist of breakfast and needed only a little help to saddle his pony, Midgie.  Reporter Jerome Cvitanovich said it was a great experience for the crew to spend a week at Mt White - made even more special by seeing the muster through the eyes of an eight-year-old.  &quot;He showed a lot of spirit and never complained - he's clearly got the makings of a real high country musterer.&quot;
