When smoking, the brain is stimulated and sends signals to the adrenal glands to release norepinephrine, which increases the heart rate. Carbon monoxide enters the blood in place of oxygen. The nicotine present in the smoke of the cigarette raises the body's blood pressure. Atheroma builds up and blocks the arteries, which if totally blocked, increases the heart's work load, sometimes with fatal consequences.

The consumption of alcohol causes intoxication. Alcohol makes the heart beat abnormally and decreases the force of heart muscle contraction. Cirrhosis of the liver is caused by excess alcohol, and alcohol also inflames the stomach lining. Increased water loss from the kidney leading to dehydration, is also an effect of alcohol.
