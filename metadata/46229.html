About the Series:
Set in contemporary Israel and British Occupied Palestine in the aftermath of WWII, The Promise is an explosive new political thriller examining the origins of the Middle East conflict.

A four-part miniseries told in two time frames; the story intercuts between Len, a member of the British military in 1945 Palestine, and Len's granddaughter Erin, who in modern-day Israel follows his extraordinary past via a recently discovered journal.

Len's story begins during the last days of the Second World War when, as a member of the British military, he arrives at the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen and is confronted with the horrors that lay within. With these harrowing images still burning in his mind, Len is sent to Palestine, where he is in charge of peacekeeping between the indigenous Arabs and traumatised Jews arriving in their thousands from post-Holocaust Europe, for whom he feels intense sympathy. He expects that his time in Palestine will be a gentle conclusion to his bloody military career, but for Len and his friends the war is far from over.

While sympathetic to the plight of the Jews, Len and his comrades soon find their compassion tested as they come under sustained attack from a Jewish militant organisation, determined to drive Len and his fellow British soldiers out of the country. Just as Len finds his sympathy shifting, he falls in love with Clara, a Jewish concentration camp survivor now trying to make a new home for herself in the emerging Jewish state.

The contemporary story focuses on Len's granddaughter Erin, an 18 year old British girl spending her summer in modern day Israel. When Erin starts to read her grandfather's diary, she learns that he ended his time in Palestine in a military prison and is determined to find out why. She begins to retrace his steps in modern day Israel, embarking on a journey that will take her outside the secure bubble of the prosperous Jewish suburb she's staying in.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:27:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-08-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:20:00</td></tr></table>
