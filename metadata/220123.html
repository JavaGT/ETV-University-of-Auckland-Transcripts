Noel Gallagher celebrates 10 years of the High Flying Birds, giving an exclusive and revealing interview alongside a 12-song set filmed at London's Duke of York's theatre. 

In an age of celebrity blandness, where famous people usually decline to say much of interest in public, Noel Gallagher is reliably forthright in doling out his opinions. Last week, doing the rounds, he let rip at hard-to-hit targets such as Prince Harry (&ldquo;woke snowflake&rdquo;) and Little Mix (&ldquo;not in the same league as Oasis&rdquo;). In this documentary he digs into the Oasis split, explaining that their break-up was &ldquo;the best thing for me and for the band&rdquo;. Prior to that, he said, they were &ldquo;not lauded as one of the greats of all time&rdquo;. I saw them trudge through a handful of joyless festival sets in the 00s, which were, like Little Mix, &ldquo;not in the same league as Oasis&rdquo;. Calling it a day made them into greats, because it meant they never quite had the chance to become fully spoiled. If Oasis ever reunite it will be surprising, giving the acrimony between the brothers, which means that for now, they have a definite ending.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:12:16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Documentary, Entertainment, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Anthropology, Careers, Design, History, Leadership, Literature, Media Studies, Music, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-11-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
