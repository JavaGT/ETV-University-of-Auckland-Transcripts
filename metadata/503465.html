New Zealand&rsquo;s horticulture industry is worth ten billion dollars a year to our economy. But it also hides an uneasy secret &ndash; where the migrant workers it relies on to get products to market can be abused and exploited. Recent investigations found evidence of RSE workers crowded in substandard accommodation with workers unable to leave because of crippling debt to their employers.

Tania Page travels to a small Canterbury town where agricultural land could be dwarfed by development &ndash; and finds a community divided.
