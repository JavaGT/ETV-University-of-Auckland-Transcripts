We walk where the battalions fought and where the artillery sank in liquid mud. In the midst of the battle one of Australia's greatest soldiers, then Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Morshead, wrote &quot;things are bloody, very bloody&quot;. The losses were enormous - on October 12th the New Zealand Division lost 2800 men, the bloodiest day in that country's military history.

About the series:
Follows the ANZAC experience on the western front. From the first deployment of troops early in 1916 after the evacuation of Gallipoli, to the ceasefire and defeat of Germany in November 1918. Each episode charts the experience of the troops chronologically telling the stories of the battles, the military units that figured prominently and of individuals. It also follows the emergence of the tactics and weapons that responded to the stalemate of trench warfare. Our guides are Neil Pigot, actor and commentator on military history and Dr Peter Pedersen &ndash; military historian and former commanding officer at battalion level. With them we visit the battlefields of the western front &ndash; and through the use of oral history, archive, animation and computer graphics &ndash; explain how the Australian and New Zealand units figured in some of the costliest battles of modern times.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:31:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-08-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:30:00</td></tr></table>
