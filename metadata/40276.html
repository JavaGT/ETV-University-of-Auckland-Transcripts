Callahan Piano artisans take apart and rebuild the instrument for the First Berkeley Piano Competition before our eyes, hewing to standards as precise as one-tenth of a gram. The close relationships and easy humor of the workshop accompany the highly professional techniques and tools. The winner of the competition, Jared Redmond, finally makes his debut on what is now his Steinway grand at the party given in the workshop as a finale. The celebration is not only about talent, but also about the dedication of crafts people who give good performers a means to play better than they had ever imagined.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Music, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-02-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
