New Zealand is big on love as a country, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that a homegrown show about Māori marriage celebrants has hit our screens. Each week, Aroha Nui: Say I Do feature a different Māori celebrant and follows their process as they prepare to officiate the wedding of a couple who have agreed to share their big day (and the lead up) with Aotearoa.

It&rsquo;s a simple, but effective premise, highlighting the celebrant&rsquo;s reasons for doing what they do and the cultural desire by many to incorporate tradition &ndash; and often language &ndash; on their big day.
The celebrants in Aroha Nui: Say I Do are as real as the people they marry. Like the young bilingual husband-and-wife duo from Papamoa, juggling work as a Police physical education officer and occupational therapist, parenting their young son and uniting people in marriage.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:47</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment, Interview, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Careers, Health, Maori, Media Studies, New Zealand, Pacifica, Psychology, Religion & Theology, Social Studies, Sociology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
