Tractors have been used by American farmers since the late 19th century and, like most machinery, have been improved upon greatly since their invention. But despite modern technology, there is still a faction of tractor enthusiasts who love the classics. This series is a dream come true for such people. It features early tractor models that helped farmers increase productivity by being able to replace horses and mules in plowing, planting and other tasks. The show also profiles people who own classic machines and have some of the biggest collections of traditional tractors. Other features include highlights of classic tractor shows across America and field demonstrations that include plowing, tilling and threshing.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Engineering, History, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>COUNTRY99</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-05-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
