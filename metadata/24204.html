On the buses: Getting caught driving in a bus lane can be an expensive encounter - it can cost you a $150 fine.  Rain or shine - they're out in all weather - perched on the side of the road - on the bus lane blitz. The rule is you can't turn left on a bus lane unless you're within 50 metres of that turn - to break the rule's going to cost you $150.  That's the same fine as running a red light. Under new road rules which came out on November 1st, 50 metres was made the minimum length from where you could drive on a special vehicle lane like one for buses when you're making a left turn. The rules came out the same time driving while talking on a cellphone was banned.
