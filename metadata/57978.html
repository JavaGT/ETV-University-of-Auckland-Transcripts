Presenter Russell Brown and the rest of the Media3 team believe in being both intelligent and entertaining -- and creating more light than heat. 

In a media sector experiencing rapid and historic change -- not least in the blurring of the lines between consumers and producers of media -- there'll never be a shortage of stories. 

The show is recorded in front of a live audience in Auckland and it onscreen debates and interviews are accompanied by field reports, news backgrounders and, says Brown, &quot;occasional mickey-taking of our media peers.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:35:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-07-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:30:00</td></tr></table>
