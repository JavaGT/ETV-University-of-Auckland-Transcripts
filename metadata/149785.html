But even as they do, the political costs to Wasicsko become apparent.

Based on the nonfiction book of the same name by Lisa Belkin, the miniseries &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot; tells the story of how civil rights violations tear apart Yonkers, N.Y., paralyze the municipal government, and forever change the lives of a rising politician and his constituents. Faced with a federal court order that remedies decades-long housing segregation in the city, newly elected Mayor Nick Wasicsko -- at 28, the youngest-ever mayor of Yonkers -- goes against his campaign position that advocated legal appeals, paving the way for low-income housing to be built in white neighborhoods of Yonkers. Residents rage about protecting property values, while those chosen to cross the color line will soon have neighbors who fiercely oppose them.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Law, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-01-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
