The Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 disaster has not only sparked conversations about aviation safety, but prompted a furious debate over how Western media outlets covered it. Some observers, such as The Atlantic&rsquo;s Hannah Giorgis, noted the tragedy was reported unevenly, focusing more &quot;on non-African passengers and organisations.&quot; This despite the fact that nine Ethiopians and 32 Kenyans were killed - the most victims from any nation.

Kenyan writer and political cartoonist Patrick Gathara added that media organisations forget there is no such thing as an &ldquo;African story&rdquo;, saying that any effort to compress the lives and experiences of millions of Africans and thousands of cultures &ldquo;will always say more about the prejudices and laziness of the journalist than about his subjects.&rdquo;

Many felt that prejudice was on display when one international news anchor erroneously stated that Africa's most successful airline had a &ldquo;poor safety record.&rdquo;

So how does coverage of the crash fit within a broader Western media narrative that often covers the continent using racist and colonialist tropes? We ask a panel of east Africans.
