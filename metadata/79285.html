BRITISH PATH&Eacute;'S STORY
Before television, people came to movie theatres to watch the news. British Path&eacute; was at the forefront of cinematic journalism, blending information with entertainment to popular effect. Over the course of a century, it documented everything from major armed conflicts and seismic political crises to the curious hobbies and eccentric lives of ordinary people. If it happened, British Path&eacute; filmed it.

Now considered to be the finest newsreel archive in the world, British Path&eacute; is a treasure trove of 85,000 films unrivalled in their historical and cultural significance.
