The unsung heroes of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd and 3103rd Signal Companies (Special) saved thousands of lives and helped win the war, but their efforts were kept secret for over fifty years and have yet to be fully recognized.

Roy Eichhorn discusses the formation of the Ghost Army, its operations and the many Jewish soldiers who played important roles. This includes the Ghost Army&rsquo;s special assignment during the early period of the liberation of concentration and labor camps when they cared for 100,000 displaced persons.
