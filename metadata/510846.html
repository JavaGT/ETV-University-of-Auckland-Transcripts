He&rsquo;s confident when speaking te reo Māori but he&rsquo;s also on his own te ao Māori journey alongside the rest of his Spark whānau. Riki has been working at the telecommunications and digital services company for 27 years, almost four of those as Māori development lead.

Yet when a call comes in for him to lead a mihi whakatau in the large atrium of Spark&rsquo;s Tāmaki Makaurau HQ, Riki still gets nervous. Even as a confident speaker, standing up and speaking te reo in front of a group is, well, kinda scary.

So Riki understands the trepidation of some colleagues as they get involved with the company&rsquo;s te ao Māori-based kaupapa, which sit within Spark&rsquo;s Māori strategy Te Korowai Tupu o Kora Aotearoa &ndash; the cloak of growth of Spark New Zealand.
