Ravel&acute;s Bol&eacute;ro only came out of copyright on May 1st, 2016. Until then it made its composer and heirs millions. Ravel left everything to his brother Edouard who, after losing his wife due to a car crash, hired Jeanne Taverne as a nurse and took on her husband as driver. When Edouard passed away the Tavernes inherited everything and begun to play tax games while hiding their rights in offshore companies.

Filmmaker Fabien Caux-Lahalle underpins this fascinating story with clips of the Bol&eacute;ro in various guises from Benny Goodman&acute;s big band version to a DJ remix, from Frank Zappa to Ruth Page&acute;s ballet, from a foxtrot to a Mexican polka. Contributors include rare footage with Alexandre Taverne, Arthur Rubinstein, Manuel Rosenthal, Claude Lelouche, who paid over the odds to use the music in his film Les uns et les autres, Jack Lang, Senator Alain Richard and Ma&icirc;tre Andr&eacute; Schmidt, well known to most of us as he oversees the Prokofiev inheritance in France.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Music, Documentary, Entertainment, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>French, History, Languages, Media Studies, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-11-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:00:00</td></tr></table>
