Neil Oliver explores the province of Finist&egrave;re, &quot;The End of the Earth&quot;, and meets a lighthouse keeper made famous by one of the world's most reproduced photographs. Nick Crane joins the &quot;Onion Johnnies&quot;, who gave us our stereotypical image of a Frenchman, complete with stripy tee shirt, beret and bicycle laden with onions. Alice Roberts reveals the life-saving chemical element that is locked away inside seaweed and Miranda Krestovnikoff dives for a seafood delicacy. At Carnac, Mark Horton wanders amongst the mysterious lines of standing stones, erected thousands of years before Stonehenge, to investigate their age-old connection with Britain.
