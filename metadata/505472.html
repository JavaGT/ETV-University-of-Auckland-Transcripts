Jenny Muirhead,the only other girl on the course,speaks up for her but naively lets her down though fortunately the principled Professor Ritchie acts as her advocate and ensures she is not expelled. Jenny's parents,the wealthy Lord and Lady Muirhead,give James employment at their dog kennels but James and Ritchie are appalled to find that they are Fascist supporters who have Mrs Munro's Jewish lover Oskar arrested for challenging them. Their pro-Aryan beliefs also extend to an insistence on a pure bloodline in their animals,allowing the weakest to die and Ritchie and James rescue a sick dog by threatening to expose the bitchy Lady Muirhead's affair with her chief dog handler. As the term ends Whirly,McAloon and James learn that they have all passed their exams and are ready to help Professor Ritchie examine a sick elephant.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:14:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PG</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-11-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:15:00</td></tr></table>
