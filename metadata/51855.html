&ldquo;Imagine the sexual tension,&rdquo; says our guide to Australian history. It is 1788, the fleet of convict colonisers has been at sea for nine months under terms of strict sexual segregation. Tony Robinson conjures a ribald picture of what happened next. His engaging series briskly recalls the hazardous early days of Britain&rsquo;s penal colony. But this is no celebrity travelogue &mdash; Robinson has an intelligent grasp on the history and the series has a quirky way of re-enacting events. By the time of Darwin&rsquo;s visit in 1836 the tented encampment on starvation rations had become a thriving going concern. But there is the parallel story of the decline of Aboriginal peoples, devastated by smallpox then war with the people who occupied their lands.
The actor follows the story of the first fleet to set sail for New South Wales. On arrival, the convicts were in a celebratory mood, but the early years of the colony were marred by a fight for survival between the indigenous Australians and the European settlers.

A personal exploration of what has made modern Australia. It&rsquo;s an engaging trip that tells an extraordinary history of discovery and colonisation. What makes it fun is Robinson&rsquo;s flair for the quirky &mdash; the man who gave us the words &ldquo;avocado&rdquo; and &ldquo;barbecue&rdquo;, the goat elected to the Royal Society (its first female member) and the convicts who opted for execution rather than transportation.
