This week we're heading underground to discover what part paleontology and archeology play in understanding just who we are as a country and where we might be heading in the future.

Ever Wondered? sees 2009 MacDiarmid Young Scientist of the Year Dr John Watt visiting top Kiwi scientists working on world class research and innovation.

Over two ten-part, 30-minute series, John answers challenging scientific questions as he talks to Kiwi scientists and researchers and joins in on high-tech and hair-raising experiments. Produced in partnership with the Royal Society of New Zealand, this lively and informative family series is brimming with scientific facts and technological wonder.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Geography, New Zealand, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ HEARTLAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:30:00</td></tr></table>
