It's magazine-style infotainment with a target demographic of 10-16 year olds - think &quot;Rove&quot; or &quot;Ellen&quot; with a teenage twist.

In her apartment-styled studio Erin chats with some of New Zealand's biggest stars from music, TV, sports and the arts who inspire our audience to be the best they can.  

Out on the street, a team of passionate young reporters cover what matters giving viewers a VIP front row seat to the country's best events, people and places. Join All White Aaron Clapham and Kenny Lynn from the Highlanders (Sports), Shortland Street actress Kim Crossman (Entertainment), fashion guru Serena Rongonui (Fashion &amp; Events) and committed greenies Eve Marama and Nic Vallance (Environment) to get the low down.  Meanwhile London based reporter Jon Franks gets the inside scoop at the glitzy premieres and gives the show an international feel!

As well the show celebrates our young tall poppies putting teenagers onscreen to tell their own inspiring real life stories of achievement, skill and determination.

The Erin Simpson Show's also jam-packed with music, video and game reviews and competitions with must-have prizes: trips to LA, flights to Justin Bieber's Sydney concert,  backstage passes to meet Katy Perry</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Pacifica</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
