The Illustrated Man is a large-scale photographic series and full length documentary by New York based photographer &amp; director Sophy Holland; featuring male tattooed celebrity and fashion icons from across America &amp; Europe, the series captures the reimagination of tattoos from the stereotypical associations of sailors and the criminal classes, into the celebration of mainstream pop culture, fashion trends, branding and social influence.
