It offers an insightful and practical introduction to caring for children in both day care and kindergarten settings. We meet Pedagogy Leader Catherine Lees and Teacher Lin Xue at a typical day care centre. We observe them at work and discuss important issues such as physical care, helping children understand their own physical needs, encouraging responsibility, and responding to emotional needs. We also learn how to assist children with hygiene, safety and exercise, and how to create a stable environment, foster independence and show empathy to children.
