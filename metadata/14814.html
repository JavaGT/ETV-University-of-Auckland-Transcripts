There have been more controversial revelations in the case. First there is the 111 call that police alleged contained the words &quot;I shot the prick&quot;. But did he say that? And if not, why did his lawyers fight all the way to the Supreme Court to keep that part of the call secret? Then there is the disturbing claim of David Bain's sexual fantasies and how he may have planned to use his paper round alibi to cover another alleged crime. The witnesses weren't allowed to testify and their evidence was ruled inadmissible, but Sunday reveals for the first time what the jury did not get to hear.  
 One night in Sofia:&amp;#8232;Ozzie Jock Palfreeman was hardly out of school when he went on his OE. But his adventure went horribly wrong and today he's locked up in the chill and squalor of a prison in Bulgaria after stabbing a local to death.

Palfreeman's father is desperate to prove his son's innocence - but is Bulgaria interested in delivering justice?

The Christian film industry fights back against the perceived power and &quot;evil&quot; of mainstream Hollywood.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
