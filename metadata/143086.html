Everything about Comey&rsquo;s firing was unusual, Oliver noted, from Comey having found out about it on TV, to the &ldquo;genuinely weird&rdquo; termination letter. In it, Trump wrote in part: &ldquo;While I greatly appreciate your informing me on three separate occasions I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the department of justice that you  are not able to effectively lead the bureau.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It is inherently suspicious to try to put words in Comey&rsquo;s mouth as you kick him out the door,&rdquo; Oliver insisted.
