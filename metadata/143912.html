Bermuda is hosting the 35th America&rsquo;s Cup. The eyes of the world are turning to the iconic Great Sound where the best sailors on the fastest boats will battle for the oldest trophy in international sport. 

Racing starts with the Louis Vuitton America&rsquo;s Cup Qualifiers on 26th May and the top Challenger will meet Defending Champions Oracle Team USA in the 35th America&rsquo;s Cup Match presented by Louis Vuitton beginning on 17th June, 2017.

For over three centuries, the mystique that is Bermuda has been slowly evolving, with each generation adding its own tales to the story. Now there&rsquo;s an exciting new chapter being written as Bermuda becomes Home of the 2017 America&rsquo;s Cup.

Bermuda is composed of 181 islands, totaling 21 square miles, and has just over 60,000 residents. As you would expect in a place with so many islands, water activities are the life-blood of Bermuda.

Renowned for crystal blue water and beautiful pink sand beaches, Bermuda&rsquo;s Great Sound will form a natural amphitheatre for the race course while the planned America&rsquo;s Cup Village at the Royal Naval Dockyard, will be the beating heart of the America&rsquo;s Cup experience.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:40:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-06-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>06:30:00</td></tr></table>
