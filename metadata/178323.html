About series:
Twelve ordinary people are called for jury duty for a murder case as traumatizing as it is controversial: the respected headmistress Fri Palmers stands accused of two murders, one of whom is her own child. Gradually, as the trial gains momentum, it is not only Fri's fate that hangs in the balance, but also the lives of the jury members that are shaken to the core. Each jury member reacts based on his or her own personal scars and life experience. It is up to them to decide on the guilt or the innocence of this broken woman on trial.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:47:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Languages, Law, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-03-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
