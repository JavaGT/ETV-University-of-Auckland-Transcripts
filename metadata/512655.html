Once thrusted back into civilian life in Muncie, Indiana, McKinney's rage against Muslims - Islamophobic ideas shaped by his time in the military - took a new and dangerous turn. 

He wanted to bomb a local mosque.

McKinney's story is told in the documentary short &ldquo;Stranger at the Gate&rdquo;, which was nominated for an Oscar this year. Intent on gathering intel on local Muslims at the Muncie Islamic Center, McKinney is welcomed into their community with compassion and kindness. Over time, he decides not to carry out his bomb plot, converts to Islam and eventually becomes president of the Islamic centre. 

&ldquo;Stranger at the Gate&rdquo; director Josh Seftel says the film is ultimately about overcoming hate and finding common ground with others. It&rsquo;s a much-needed message for an increasingly polarised world.
