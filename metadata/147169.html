The story goes back in time starting when the killer is caught, to the beginning of his killing spree. 

About series:
What makes a serial killer? Or the cop who is compelled to relentlessly track him down? What are the
events that form a person into the human being they will become &ndash; killer or cop?

Rellik is a serial killer story told backwards, starting with the suspected killer being caught before shifting to
the very beginning &ndash; the crime itself. As the story traces the obsessive hunt of a disfigured detective, his
story becomes intrinsically bound to that of his quarry, asking the question &ndash; what are the experiences that
forge the people we all become?
