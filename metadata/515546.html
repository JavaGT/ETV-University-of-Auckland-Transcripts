It&rsquo;s surprisingly common, but divorce is one of those painful things we&rsquo;d rather not talk about. Last year 16 thousand New Zealanders married while seven thousand couples divorced, and that&rsquo;s not counting those who ended de facto relationships and civil unions. Most tie the knot thinking it&rsquo;ll last forever but forever, according to Stats NZ, lasts only 13 and a half years. Divorce needs to be dealt with by a lawyer and that can be expensive. Now there&rsquo;s a new option, brought to you by the wellness industry; divorce coaches who manage what can be one of the most stressful times of your life.

It&rsquo;s now more than a month since a Hamas attack on Israel sparked a brutal and bloody war in Gaza. The sheer magnitude of the destruction &ndash; lives lost, houses destroyed, and people displaced &ndash; is hard to comprehend.

Those looking to slim down wanted to quickly get their hands on Ozempic. And when Hollywood faces started showing off their new-look skinnier selves, the drug gained even more buzz. But experts are warning there could be another side effect from the often-unsupervised use of Ozempic: death.
