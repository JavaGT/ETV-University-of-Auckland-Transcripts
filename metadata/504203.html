Following the service, one of the largest military processions ever assembled will accompany the cort&egrave;ge as it processes through central London before The Queen&rsquo;s final journey home to Windsor Castle.

Once in Windsor, HM The King and members of the Royal Family will join the congregation for the Committal Service at St George&rsquo;s Chapel. 

Throughout the day, special guests with personal connections to Queen Elizabeth II and royal experts will share their thoughts and analysis on this historic occasion and pay tribute to The Queen&rsquo;s incredible life of service and duty.

The programme will be presented by Huw Edwards in London and Kirsty Young in Windsor with commentary from Fergal Keane at Westminster Abbey in London and David Dimbleby in Windsor.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>06:19:32</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Leadership, Media Studies, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-09-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:35:00</td></tr></table>
