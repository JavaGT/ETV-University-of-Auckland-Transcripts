Based on the true story behind author A.A. Milne&rsquo;s beloved character Winnie the Pooh, this is a tale of the remarkable friendship between a Canadian soldier and the cub that stood as a symbol of friendship and hope in a world plagued by war. It was during the early days of World War I that veterinarian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn (Michael Fassbender) purchased a small bear cub and named her Winnie after his hometown of Winnipeg. As the spectre of war looms heavy in the conscience of the citizens and children of London, Winnie becomes the star attraction at the zoo. When a man named A.A. Milne brings his young son to visit the zoo, the story of the bear and her friendship with a faraway soldier inspires him to create one of the most beloved characters in the history of children&rsquo;s literature.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:27:12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children, Comedy, Drama, Entertainment, Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Careers, English, Literature, Media Studies, Natural History, Political Studies, Social Studies, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2008-04-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:00:00</td></tr></table>
