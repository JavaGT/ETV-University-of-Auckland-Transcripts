After the mourning, the community gathered its strength to continue King&rsquo;s fight, inspired by the fiery protest of Nina Simone, the black power anthems of James Brown, and the extraordinary voice of Aretha Franklin. The continued struggle for civil rights has been a long and uneven battle since 1968, but the spirit of resistance has been kept alive in the music, from Stevie Wonder&rsquo;s campaign to establish a Martin Luther King Holiday to Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s searing protest song that became an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement. The music in this episode both celebrates the strength and solidarity of the African American experience while reminding us how far we still have to go.
