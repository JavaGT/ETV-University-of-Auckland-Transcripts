About series:
Kiwis from all walks of life have been watching the fishing adventures of Matt Watson for over a decade, and now Prime brings you his brand new series, ITM Hook Me Up! Each episode will unearth the backstory of a special guest (including some well-known New Zealanders) and uncover what their ultimate fishing dream is. Whether it&rsquo;s a giant tuna in Canada, a billfish in Malaysia, or that big snapper that has been eluding a keen fisher for decades, Matt and his team pull out all the stops to give the special guest an adventure they will never forget. On the first episode Matt takes boxer Joseph Parker and his dad out on the boat to catch some good eating fish.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Leadership, Media Studies, New Zealand, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-10-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
