About series:
Light always finds a way to shine.

Inspired by Bellevue, the oldest public hospital in America, this unique medical drama follows the brilliant and charming Dr. Max Goodwin, the institution&rsquo;s newest medical director who sets out to tear up the bureaucracy and provide exceptional care.

Dr. Goodwin must disrupt the status quo and prove he will stop at nothing to breathe new life into this understaffed, underfunded and underappreciated hospital &ndash; the only one in the world capable of treating Ebola patients, dangerous prisoners and the President of the United States under one roof &ndash; and return it to the glory that put it on the map.

Starring Ryan Eggold (The Blacklist), Freema Agyeman (Doctor Who), Janet Montgomery (This Is Us), Jocko Sims (The Last Ship), Tyler Labine (Reaper) and Anupam Kher (Silver Linings Playbook).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:41:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-05-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
