Based on actual events that took place in 1971, a white southern high school is integrated with black students from a nearby school. Both schools are recognised for their football programs which are now unified. The black coach is chosen to be the head coach of the integrated team, leaving the previous white head coach with feelings of animosity at having to be an assistant under a black man.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:56:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, History, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-11-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:05:00</td></tr></table>
