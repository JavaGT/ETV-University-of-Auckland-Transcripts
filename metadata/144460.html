Told through the eyes of Henrietta&rsquo;s daughter Deborah (Oprah Winfrey), the film chronicles her search, along with journalist Rebecca Skloot (Rose Byrne), to learn about the mother she never knew and learn how the unauthorised harvesting of cells in 1951 led to unprecedented medical breakthroughs, changing countless lives and the face of medicine forever.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:28:52</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Health, Literature, Media Studies, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
