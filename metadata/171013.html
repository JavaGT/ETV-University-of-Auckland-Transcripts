In this series, physicist Dr Helen Czerski explores the extraordinary science of temperature. She unlocks the extremes of the temperature scale, from absolute zero to searing heat of stars - and reveals how temperature works, how deep its influence on our lives is, and why it's the hidden force that has shaped our planet and the entire universe.

In episode one, Helen ventures to the bottom of the temperature scale, revealing how cold has shaped the world around us and why frozen doesn't mean what you might think. She meets the scientists pushing temperature to the very limits of cold, where the normal laws of physics break down and a new world of scientific possibility begins. The extraordinary behaviour of matter at temperatures close to absolute zero is driving the advance of technology, from superconductors to quantum computing.

About Series:
Temperature is a natural part of our everyday lives. It&rsquo;s there when we shiver in the cold, watch a lightning storm or boil the kettle for tea. We think we know all about temperature, but the science behind it is full of surprises.

Explosive demonstrations and fascinating case studies examine temperatures at a molecular, human and planetary level. Witness solids that behave like liquids, super-cooled ceramics that defy gravity, and plasmas hotter than the sun. Everyday notions of temperature are turned on their head in a show guaranteed to provoke heated debate.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:05:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC Earth</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-10-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
