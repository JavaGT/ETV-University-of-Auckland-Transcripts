He loves ACDC, and dressing up like Angus Young. He's got his own drum kit to thrash out his own beats on. Benjiro lives with Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral Palsy affects people in a variety of ways, for Benjiro it makes his leg muscles very tight and difficult to walk. When it comes to pranking, Benjiro likes things to get messy - for the camera as well as for Shakti!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:02:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-04-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:32:00</td></tr></table>
