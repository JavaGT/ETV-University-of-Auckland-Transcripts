For Spring/Summer 2014, Tisci brought out all the stops where prints were concerned, dishing out breathtaking imagery in an urban way by combining elements that wouldn't normally be seen together. From computer hard drives to sports jerseys to dart boards - the action was all here with a crazy and cool mix of motifs not seen anywhere else.
