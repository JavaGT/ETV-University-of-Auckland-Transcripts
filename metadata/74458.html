Moray was once a draper's boy in Emersons, the small shop that grew under his managership into The Paradise, which has come to dominate the high street to the detriment of small shopkeepers nearby.

&quot;Episode 2&quot;
Katherine Glendenning brings her friend Mrs Brookmire (Olivia Hallinan) to the store to cheer her up. Dazzled by the array of goods and the attention given to her by Sam at the draper's counter, Mrs Brookmire buys so many items that Moray opens the first store account for her to settle the bill at a later date. Taken ill, Mrs Brookmire is helped by Sam. She invites him to the Glendennings' home, where she breaks down to reveal she has left her husband. She kisses Sam just as Lord Glendenning and Katherine walk in; he is accused of ungentlemanly behaviour and Moray is asked to dismiss him. The reputation of The Paradise is at stake; Moray wants to discover the truth, and Denise decides to help.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:08:05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Drama, History, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-02-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
