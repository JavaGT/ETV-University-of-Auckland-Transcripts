Billy Guyton grew up wanting to be an All Black. Instead, he will be remembered as NZ&rsquo;s first professional rugby player diagnosed with CTE &ndash; a brain disease linked to repeated head knocks. Concussions forced him into retirement from rugby at age 28, and he died five years later struggling with his mental health. A video he made at the time shows how he sought out help and was ignored. His whanau now ask where rugby was when he needed it most, and share Billy's message of why player welfare and education matters. 
 
AGEING PARADISE
It's a place where the food is fantastic, the weather spectacular, the swimming pool inviting and where the rooms have all the mod-cons. It's resort life at Vivo Bene in northern Thailand where pampering is the priority. But this is no ordinary holiday paradise. The guests at Vivo Bene are elderly and most have dementia. Unlike other aged-care providers, the treatment isn't dominated by medication, but instead, it includes love, laughter, and giving vulnerable humans the time &ndash; and respect &ndash; they deserve. So why are there not aged-care facilities like this in New Zealand?
