Aging and rejuvenation are everyday terms we all understand (aging meaning to get older, rejuvenation being the opposite, to get younger), but what are these materials, these soft, glassy complex fluids? Well, any material that has fluid and something else in it is a complex fluid. The 'something else' can be a gas in the case of foams (just like the foam in your milkshake or the foam when you wash you hair). It can be a solid in the case of suspensions (like the tiny fat particles in milk. It's the fat that scatters the light making milk appear 'milky', so the less fat there is, the more watery it looks. Or it can be another liquid in the case of emulsions (like salad dressings that have both water and oil in them). This 'something else' always changes the way the fluid flows. Simon's goal is to see how and why these materials change over time and how to rejuvenate them to bring them back to their youthful states. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Simon Rogers - PhD student in Physics at Victoria University of Wellington.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Chemistry, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
