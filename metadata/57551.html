Nurses deal with people, and often those with whom they deal are highly vulnerable. Nurses have a duty of care to patients, and their profession demands ethical behaviour and treatment of those in their care -- at all times.
This program explores ethics in nursing, with reference to the Australian Code of Nursing Ethics. It defines ethics, and explains why it is critical that nurses know about ethics and the standards of behaviour that are demanded by their profession. It also takes a look at what ethics are not, as often there can be confusion in people's minds about exactly what defines ethics. It examines various types of ethics and how they impact on, and play out in, the nursing profession, and features two experts -- Sue Hunter from La Trobe University's Division of Nursing and Midwifery, and Registered Nurse, Sally Heads. 
This program is essential viewing for any nurse in training -- either at university or other post-secondary institutions. It also is ideal as a professional development tool for a range of health care institutions, clinics and care facilities.
