There are plans to create sites in the format but for now these machines are mostly limited to 3D gaming. 

 Google search becomes visual and personal : Google has fingers in many pies such as e-mail, blogging, video, instant messaging, social networks and mobile phones.
But the company is still best known for its search engine which has around 65% of the market.
