You don&rsquo;t need to be a rugby league diehard to know Wally Lewis is one of the greatest players of all time. He&rsquo;s not known as &ldquo;The King&rdquo; for nothing. Now though, heavy is the head that wears the crown. Following Sunday&rsquo;s reporting with former All Blacks, the league legend is the latest high profile footballer to be diagnosed with probable CTE &ndash; a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma. But just like he did whenever he took the field, Wally is facing his latest challenge with courage and determination. Channel 9 &lsquo;60 Minutes&rsquo;
