On Tuesday, March 27 at 19:30 GMT:
In this episode of The Stream, we&rsquo;ll look at the latest developments in three countries.

Yemen&rsquo;s prospects for peace
UN special envoy to Yemen Hans Grundberg says things are moving &ldquo;in the right direction&rdquo; in an eight-year war that has left millions of people facing life-threatening hunger, after the country&rsquo;s internationally-recognised government and opposition Houthi leaders each agreed to release hundreds of detainees.

The prisoner exchange deal announced on March 20 follows a bilateral agreement between Saudi Arabia, which leads a military coalition for the government, and Iran, which is supporting the Houthis.

But Yemenis who are enduring what UN agencies call one of the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crises are cautious about the prospects for lasting peace, despite the Saudi-Iranian rapprochement. While the UN hopes to broker a fresh truce deal that has largely held since it expired in October, an outbreak of deadly fighting in the oil-rich Marib province on March 21 has undermined diplomatic efforts.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-03-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
