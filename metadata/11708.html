Conversations with parents.

in beTWEEN is a TV series aimed at all 10- to 13-year-olds out there in NZ. We've gone out and talked to kids just like you about what's important to you and what you really want to know. We've got kids your age to test out some theories, go and do the research and even take on some challenges. And each week 60 of you will come into our studio and be part of our audience letting us know what you think, asking questions of our presenters and guests and voting in weekly polls so we know what's really going on. We're going to deal with &quot;issues&quot; - that's right, all that stuff you really want to know about but don't know who to ask.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children, Entertainment, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Maori, Pacifica</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ6</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2008-12-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:30:00</td></tr></table>
