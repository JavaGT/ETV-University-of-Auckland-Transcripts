From these unique vantage points, we experience the struggles of the nation's leaders, and members of the civilian and military chain of command, as they grapple with the unforeseen nature and extent of the deadly attack. Utilizing high-level interviews with all involved, we will watch as they confront challenges from the most basic (How do we communicate with each other?), to the profound: Are our defences pointed in the right direction? What response will calm a country under siege? How do we strike back against a terrorist attack?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:42:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Information Technology, Leadership, Political Studies, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-09-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
