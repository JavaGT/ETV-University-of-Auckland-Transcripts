Designed by Professor John Moorfield, Tōku Reo works with an interactive website to reinforce and encourage further learning.

Viewers can use the tools on the Tōku Reo website www.tokureo.Māori.nz  to reinforce the lessons.

The show is split into sections, the grammar section introduces the grammar being studied for the day. This is demonstrated in a role play by our actors; Wiremu Sarich, Kura Forrester, Hoete Mitai-Ngatai, Ross Mahuika Rawiri and Maruia Jensen. It concludes with an insert of a kaumātua explaining a dialectal word or expression.                                                                                                                                

In the vocabulary section, 10 new words are introduced each week. A series of exercises are then presented to assist with retention and it then concludes with homework from Professor John Moorfield. Every second and fourth episode is a revision episode.

By combining kaumātua, rangatahi, learners, and native speakers in the context of a beginner's learning programme, Tōku Reo is the ultimate Māori language learning experience. www.tokureo.Māori.nz</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata Māori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:00:00</td></tr></table>
