About Season 6:
The engaging, heartfelt and laugh&ndash;out&ndash;loud series returns with more hilariously sweet moments from the Dunphys, the Pritchett&ndash;Delgados, and the Tucker&ndash;Pritchetts. The summer has been exceptionally blissful in the Dunphy house: Alex is away on a humanitarian trip and the rest of the family is getting along swimmingly, but when Alex comes home, there is an immediate shift in mood. Elsewhere, Mitch and Cam have returned from their honeymoon and Mitch is acclimating to real life much quicker than the still lovey&ndash;dovey Cameron. Meanwhile, Gloria has taken issue with how little effort Jay puts into his appearance and decides to give him a taste of his own medicine.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:42</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-07-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
