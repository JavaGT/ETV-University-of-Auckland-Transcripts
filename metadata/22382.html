Demand for food is expected to double within the next 40 years. Yet we can only grow food on four per cent of the earth's surface, the climate is changing and resources like water and fuel are under threat. Jimmy meets the men and women who claim to have new techniques and new technologies that will help meet these challenges. Jimmy visits the wheat belt of Western Australia to see if farmers can overcome the global problem of soil salinity. He heads deep into the outback to catch wild animals, and takes a trip to the Murray-Darling river basin to see if vineyards can still produce good wine with only half as much water.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Business, Ecology & Environment, Food Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOOD TV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-05-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
