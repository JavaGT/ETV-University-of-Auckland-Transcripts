A mysterious band of pirates plundered the Mediterranean coast - leaving destruction in its wake. Empires fell, but out of the chaos, we discovered iron. Armed with this wonder metal, ordinary people  overthrew tyrants and built a new world order. From the birth of democracy in Athens, to the creation of the Bible in Babylon - people power reshaped 'Mankind'. 

Follow-up to 'America the Story of Us'. 'Mankind' embraces a groundbreaking way of telling this epic human story. Drawing on a growing global interest in a revelatory field of history, now adopted by universities across the globe. 'Big history' focuses on the forces of nature to show how mankind's path is guided by events that stretch back, not hundreds, but thousands, even millions of years. How the power of science, from geology and astronomy, to physics and biology, combined to shape our shared human journey. Revealing astounding global connections, and an astonishing interconnected story. This is history without limits. Free from boundaries and politics. Our story, like it's never been told before.
