A professional assassin known only as Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) gets caught up in a dangerous political takeover. He flees across Eastern Europe, hoping to find out who set him up and why. However, his growing attachment to a beautiful but traumatised young woman poses as great a threat to his survival as that of the Interpol and Russian agents who are hunting him down.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:55:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment, Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Criminology, English, Japanese, Languages, Literature, Media Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Movies Action</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-12-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
