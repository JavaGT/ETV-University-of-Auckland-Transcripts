With good conditions, the balloon will reach 70,000 feet or 13 miles above the earth and report back to enable accurate weather forecasts to be made - crucial for airforce pilots and their crews.  01.35 Home Front, Another New Industry:  Lead alloy tubes are made in New Zealand to replace the tin tubes used for toothpaste before tin supplies were diverted for the war effort.  03.15 Italian Front, NZ Troops Move Up to the Sangro River:  The New Zealand Division readies itself to move north to rejoin the 8th Army, taking on supplies and checking its tanks.  The NZ convoy rolls through Italian towns some reduced to rubble by the war, on their way to the frontline in the Sangro Valley.  Roads and bridges blown up by the retreating Germans hold up the convoy until NZ engineers get them cleared or build new routes. General Fryberg meets the troops and encourages them on. German POWs are taken and Allied aircraft pound the enemy positions in the mountains.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
