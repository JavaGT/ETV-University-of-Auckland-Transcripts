&ldquo;Now the future is here and it ain&rsquo;t a pretty thing&rdquo;
Forty years ago, five musicians joined forces. They saw that the world was on a downward spiral.  That society was no longer evolving, what we were experiencing was in fact de-evolution. Mankind was regressing&hellip;.  We were destroying the planet. They believed that the world was dominated by greed and consumerism and that the planet would ultimately be destroyed by the only species that couldn&rsquo;t live as one with their environment. MAN. In music they found a vehicle to share their dire prediction of human decay.  They were DEVO, short for De-evolution. Brothers Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh joined Gerald Casale and his brother Bob along with drummer Alan Myers.  They wanted to &ldquo;sound different, look different and act different&rdquo;.  With their signature synth sound and confrontational lyrics, they challenged musical norms.  They are best remembered for their 1980 hits and quirky music videos for &ldquo;Whip it&rdquo; and &ldquo;Freedom of choice&rdquo; but their comic fa&ccedil;ade distracted many listeners from a grave message that today is disturbingly haunting.

In the 1980&rsquo;s their punk scientist attitude was seen as whacky and extreme. They shared a trailblazing environmental message but their predictions were often mocked, now 40 years later we ask, Were DEVO Right? 40 years after the release of their timeless classic &ldquo;Beautiful World&rdquo; we follow the remix and launch of  &ldquo;Beautiful World 2&rdquo;, a dark tribute to a world that proved them right.

This film enters the minds of one of histories most misunderstood bands and shares their vision of a World that is now paying the ultimate price.They were always political to the core and today they think the world has a lot to answer for.
