These fibres, also known as holy fibres or microstructured fibres, and are characterised by the presence of an array of holes or voids in the glass which run the full length of the fibre. These holes can be a fraction of a micrometer in diameter but many kilometres long! &lt;br&gt; The holes have the effect of substantially modifying the propagation of light within the fibre and, through their ability to manipulate these and to confine the light to a smaller diameter core than in a conventional fibre, they can lead to the generation of an extraordinary range of new phenomena. &lt;br&gt; Featuring John Harvey, Professor of Physics and Gordon Wong, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Auckland.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:04:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2007-07-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
