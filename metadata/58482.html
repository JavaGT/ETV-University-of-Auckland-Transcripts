National Geographic Emerging Explorer Aziz Abu Sarah is a cultural educator and a specialist in conflict resolution. His core aim is to create opportunities for dialogue among people that are on opposing sides of a conflict. The hope is that if each side sees the other as human beings, they are less likely to support one another's destruction. Could a soccer game among mixed teams of Israeli and Palestinian boys help?
