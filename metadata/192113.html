About series:
Based on real accounts and inspired by contemporary events, this French spy thriller follows the daily lives and missions of members of the country's external security service -- France's equivalent of the CIA. It focuses on intelligence officer Guillaume Debailly, code named &quot;Malotru,&quot; who is mysteriously recalled to Paris after spending six years under cover in Syria. As he tries to re-connect with his daughter, ex-wife and colleagues, Debailly risks everything by resuming contact with his married lover, Nadia, who might have secrets of her own that jeopardize the agent.
