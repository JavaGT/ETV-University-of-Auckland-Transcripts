101 East meets the women wrestlers and boxers battling for their rights in and out of the sporting arena in India.
In India, wrestling is generally a man&rsquo;s world. The practice dates back more than 1,000 years but, traditionally, girls were not allowed to even step onto a wrestling mat.

Girls have also been unwelcome in another combat sport &ndash; boxing.

Yet a few women have bravely defied convention and risen to the top of their sport, inspiring a new generation of girls.

And they are also taking the fight to the streets, sparking the country&rsquo;s first MeToo movement in Indian sport.
