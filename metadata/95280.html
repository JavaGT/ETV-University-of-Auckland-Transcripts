About Radar Across the Pacific:
Te Radar lives in the world's biggest Polynesian city &ndash; Auckland. But he doesn't know much about his Pacific neighbours. In this series, Radar Across the Pacific, he travels to the islands to find out more. He explores his connections with these countries and goes well beyond the tourist brochures to uncover and explore not only the challenges these small nations are facing, but also to investigate what their cultures are all about.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Economics, Geography, History, New Zealand, Pacifica, Technology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-12-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
