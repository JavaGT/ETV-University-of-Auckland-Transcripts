Raj and Howard double-date so that the Wolowitzes can meet Emily before Raj scares her off. At first Raj is afraid that Howard is going to joke about his shortcomings; however, Howard ends up to be the butt of all the jokes. He had been on a blind date with Emily years before, and due to a stomach problem, he severely messed up her bathroom and ran out on her. Howard was given the nickname &quot;Clogzilla&quot;.

Due to the latest big bang theory discoveries, Sheldon begins to believe he has wasted his life trying to prove string theory. Taking Penny's advice, he decides to get rid of all his string theory books and move on to a new field of study. As he gets frustrated with all of his possible choices, Sheldon jokes that he might as well take up geology, a subject he believes is not real science. Leonard and Penny tell him not to rush into something. Eventually, Amy puts a drunken Sheldon to bed. When he wakes up, he is horrified to see what he holds in his arms: a book on geology. He also discovers that he made many drunk-calls to Stephen Hawking's telephone.

'The Big Bang Theory' is an American sitcom. The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:32</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-07-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
