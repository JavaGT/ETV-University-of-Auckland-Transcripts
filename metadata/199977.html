About series:
With racial tensions seemingly at a higher level than normal, British comedian Jamali Maddix looks to confront racism head-on in this series. He travels around the world in an attempt to make sense of the resurgence in &quot;alt-right&quot; beliefs among social groups. His travels take him to places like Sweden, where he meets an Aryan youth group; his British homeland in the immediate aftermath of the controversial Brexit vote; and the United States during the heated 2016 presidential election cycle, where he comes face to face with Pennsylvania Nazis and black supremacists in New York. The hourlong episodes are framed with Maddix in a small London club using his comedy to reflect on his experiences.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:47:47</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Criminology, Economics, Geography, Health, History, Leadership, Media Studies, Philosophy, Political Studies, Psychology, Religion & Theology, Social Studies, Sociology, Sport, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VICELAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-02-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:00:00</td></tr></table>
