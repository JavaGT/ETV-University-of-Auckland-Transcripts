About the series:
'Te Karere' is TVNZ's Māori news programme that broadcasts entirely in Māori. Presented by Scotty Morrison.

Te Karere is a long-running daily news programme in te reo Māori. Based in the TVNZ newsroom, Te Karere covers key events and stories in the Māori world as well as bringing a Māori perspective to the day's news. Significant for pioneering Māori news on mainstream TV, for two decades it has been a platform for Māori to comment on issues and events. Founded by Derek Fox, it first went to air during Māori Language Week in 1982 and it continues to screen in a changing broadcast landscape.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:42</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori, New Zealand, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-06-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:00:00</td></tr></table>
