From conception to creation, Design DNA tells the birth stories of the beautiful and essential items in our homes. A biography of sorts where the hero may be an appliance, a gadget or a chair. Every product is celebrated for its ingenious design, its elaborate construction and, most important, its place in the hearts of consumers. Each episode features three essential pieces of home design - following the product from the first spark of conception, through the brilliance of the design to the final mechanics of the factory floor.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Design, Engineering, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-09-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:00:00</td></tr></table>
