Using examples from high street retailer, 'New Look' and outdoor specialists, 'Millets' and 'Blacks', it shows industrial textiles testing laboratories and includes footage and clear explanations of tests for flammability, abrasion and pilling, tear and tensile strength, burst and drape testing, as well as tests for care labeling, eg shrinkage and colour fastness. The programme also includes tests for high performance wear, including tests for insulation, breathability, wickability, wind and waterproofness. 2005.
