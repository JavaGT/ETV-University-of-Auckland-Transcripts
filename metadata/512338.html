According to the American Psychological Association, women and girls are depicted in a sexual manner in &ldquo;virtually every medium&rdquo; including prime time television shows, television commercials and magazines. A study carried out by Wesleyan University found that women featured in advertising campaigns, especially in men&rsquo;s magazines, were presented as sex objects 76 percent of the time.

Several experts believe this routine sexualisation of women can have devastating consequences. The UN children&rsquo;s agency said in a report that there was a direct link between the objectification of women in the media and gender-based violence.

&ldquo;When women and girls are repeatedly objectified and their bodies hypersexualised, the media contributes to harmful gender stereotypes that often trivialise violence against girls,&rdquo; the report said.

According to the UN, such depictions of women and girls can also increase anxiety about appearance, provoke feelings of shame and lead to eating disorders, low self-esteem and depression.

The release of a New York Times documentary about pop star Britney Spears has prompted several media outlets to frankly examine their own roles in the singer&rsquo;s subsequent mental health issues. Glamour Magazine even issued an apology for any part it may have played.

In this episode of The Stream, we&rsquo;ll ask why the media treats women this way and look at what the broader impacts are on women&rsquo;s health and safety.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-07-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
