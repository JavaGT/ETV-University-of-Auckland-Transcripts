Geography teacher Jon Holt is on a mission to encourage the youngsters at the school to try out activities away from the classroom that they otherwise would never have considered or been able to experience. 
Thanks to a 45ft racing yacht called Scaramouche, that way back in 1981 was crewed by the United States Admiral&rsquo;s Cup team, the school is transforming lives through its ground-breaking sailing programme.
From the classroom during the week to sailing events at the weekend, these teens are mastering the art of balancing academics and high-seas adventures!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-01-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
