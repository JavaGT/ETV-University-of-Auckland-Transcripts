About series:
Six pairs of competitive builders from across the country compare skills on the TVNZ show. The show, which required 2.5 million bricks for its production, pits pairs of builders against each other to test their Lego building prowess. Lego Masters NZ is hosted by comedian Dai Henwood and the Danish brickmaker&rsquo;s first Lego-certified professional builder, Canadian Robin Sather. Sather is one of just 21 people to hold Lego&rsquo;s certification. His appearance on Lego Masters NZ will be his first time co-hosting the popular format.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:01:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment, Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Art, Business, Design, Economics, Engineering, Media Studies, New Zealand, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
