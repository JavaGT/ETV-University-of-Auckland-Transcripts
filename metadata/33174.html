Simon talks eco bulbs with Stuart Ross from the Electricity Commission and Chris Mackenzie, an independent lighting expert. 
Stuart is promoting the use of eco bulbs and Chris has had serious concerns about their quality and some of the claims.

Some facts:
- Old style incandescent bulbs convert only 5% of electricity to light - the other 95% is wasted as heat!
- Quality new technology CFLs use up to 80% less electricity and can last 6-15 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
- Quality CFLs contain a maximum of 5mg of mercury sealed within the glass tubing, that's less than 1% of the mercury found in an amalgam dental filling.
- 10% of our total energy bill is on lighting, so it's worth giving this some attention!

Our debate:
When the bulbs were first brought out they were a) really expensive and b) seemed to put out a 'less bright' light and it had a cold 'greenish' tinge to it. They were also very ugly and there is the issue of mercury.

Simon and the two experts discuss how the new technology works, measure the quality of light and look at what the 'green tinge' is and how to avoid it.

It turns out new bulbs are like shopping for toothpaste or a household cleaner ... instead of choice being limited to just wattage and fitting type, we now need to know colour and bulb shape preference, lamp or ceiling light, as well as fitting and wattage.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:33:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ7</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-07-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:28:00</td></tr></table>
