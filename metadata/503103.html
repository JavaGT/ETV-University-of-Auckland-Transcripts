This week, two A-grade students on their studies, their part time jobs and why they can&rsquo;t afford the basics.

SOPHIA&rsquo;S LEGACY
Sophia Crestani was just 19 years old when she was crushed to death at a student party in Dunedin in 2019. She was one of hundreds of young people crammed into an old flat known locally as &lsquo;The Manor&rsquo;. Her best friend Megan Prentice was with her that night. Three years on, Megan says that Sophia wouldn&rsquo;t have died that night if Dunedin&rsquo;s student venues hadn&rsquo;t been closed down &ndash; pushing party-goers into uncontrolled and unsafe flat parties, and that changes need to be made.
