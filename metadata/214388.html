In a career spanning 35 years and more than 50 creations, Angelin Preljocaj has made a name for himself as one of the leading choreographers in contemporary dance.

His last ballet, Gravit&eacute;, questioned the laws of attraction and returned to the fundamentals of dance. Now, five months before the premiere, this film opens the door to her studio, the Pavillon Noir in Aix-en-Provence, and gives us a backstage pass to his creative process.

Rehearsals, interviews with artists and dancers including Aur&eacute;lie Dupont, Jean-Paul Gaultier, and Enki Bilal, and extracts from different performances come together on the screen to paint a portrait of a man who succeeds in making the invisible dance.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Dance, Design, Drama, French, Languages, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-09-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
