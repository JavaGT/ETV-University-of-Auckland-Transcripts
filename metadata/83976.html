After being resurrected and pulled two and a half centuries through time, Ichabod Crane finds himself in modern&ndash;day Sleepy Hollow, where he quickly realises that evil has awoken with him. When Sheriff August Corbin is killed by the infamous Headless Horseman, Ichabod forms an unlikely bond with Lieutenant Abbie Mills, a young cop who has her own childhood supernatural experiences. Together, the two embark on a mission to stop evil and uncover mysteries dating back to the founding of America. Captain Frank Irving hesitates to believe Ichabod&rsquo;s tales of supernatural evils, but when clues about impending evils from Ichabod&rsquo;s former wife Katrina begin to surface, they all begin to realise that this town is anything but sleepy.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-06-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
