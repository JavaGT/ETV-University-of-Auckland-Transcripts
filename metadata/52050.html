Stuart decides to organize a Halloween costume party at the comic book store, with Raj being the party manager. While Amy and Bernadette decide to go with Sheldon and Howard respectively, Penny is not interested as she does not like going to parties at the comic book store. Amy and Bernadette then convince her to show interest in Leonard's activities just as how Leonard shows interest in her activities even though he actually does not like them. Listening to their advice, she visits Leonard's lab the next day, where she is really fascinated by his work, as a result of which she gets turned on and ends up having sex with him in the lab. This repeats every time she visits Leonard's lab or whenever Leonard shows how smart he is. At the party too, they end up having sex in a similar fashion.

Meanwhile, Sheldon and Amy argue over what couple they should go as to the party. While Amy suggests Romeo and Juliet or Raggedy Ann and Andy, Sheldon prefers R2-D2 and C-3PO, Hewlett and Packard or salt and pepper. Eventually both agree to a compromise- Amy dresses up as Raggedy Ann, while Sheldon dresses up as Raggedy C-3PO.

Elsewhere, Howard cannot stop talking about his space mission, which bores his friends and even Bernadette. Before having sex, Bernadette tells him that she and the others are tired of listening to his adventures his space and forbids him from talking about it, which does not go down well with him. He refuses to attend the party unless he can talk about his space mission, but is eventually forced to attend by Bernadette. At the party, he lashes out at Raj for forcing him to keep quiet about his space mission, following which Bernadette confronts him, upon which he reveals that without his space adventure, he is &quot;just Howard Wolowitz&quot;. Bernadette then consoles him, saying that she fell in love with &quot;just Howard Wolowitz&quot;, after which they kiss. Later that night, Raj sends Howard a video of astronaut Buzz Aldrin irritating children by constantly referring to his trip to the Moon. On seeing the video, Howard finally realizes how irritating his constant mentioning of his space mission sounded to others.

Guest stars: Buzz Aldrin as himself and Janelle Marra as Claire.

'The Big Bang Theory' is an American sitcom. The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-03-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
