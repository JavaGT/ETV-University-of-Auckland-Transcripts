About the series:
Criminal Minds is an American police procedural television program that premiered September 22, 2005, on CBS. The series follows a team of profilers from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) based in Quantico, Virginia. The BAU is part of the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. The show differs from many procedural dramas by focusing on profiling the criminal, rather than the crime itself. The show is produced by The Mark Gordon Company in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television then CBS Paramount Network Television) and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-03-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
