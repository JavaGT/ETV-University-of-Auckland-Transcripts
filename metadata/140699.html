Tarek El Moussa grew up in Buena Park, CA, and Christina grew up in Anaheim Hills, CA. Tarek, who earned his real estate license at age 21, met Christina while working in the real estate industry.[6] The couple were selling real estate in the Southern California area[7] when the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash; they went from living in a $6,000 per month home to a $700 per month apartment.[8]

Tarek and Christina married in 2009 and have two children, a girl named Taylor Reese and a boy named Brayden James.

Today, Tarek and Christina run a real-estate agency, &quot;The El Moussa Group&quot;, in Orange County, California, an area with one of the largest foreclosure rates in the country.[14] Tarek, Christina, and their partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment house in Santa Ana for $115,000. After selling the property for a profit of $34,000, the trio split the money and continued to flip houses, expanding their real estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Design</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>HGTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-02-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
