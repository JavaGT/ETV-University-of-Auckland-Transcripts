Funds will also go to buy lamps and kerosene for Chinese students who have to study at night after working all day. 02.05 Peace in Europe: Joyful scenes as ships return home carrying troops back from World War Two. Footage of a huge Nazi rally at Nuremberg including Hitler, Hess and Goering. A reflective look at how long the world has been at war. &quot;There are five year old children who have yet to see their soldier fathers.&quot; But even though the fighting may be over, the war is not and NZ troop reinforcements are still leaving the country for occupation tasks in Europe and North Africa. There is still alot of cleaning up to be done in the Pacific. At home in NZ, there is also the huge job of getting injured soldiers rehabilitated and into worthwhile work and boosting our primary production to send more food into a starving world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
