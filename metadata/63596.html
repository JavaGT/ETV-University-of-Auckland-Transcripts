This time, for Fall 2013 at Paris Couture Fashion Week, the designers were looking to present the unexpected, and lots of surprises were in store.  This collection used a range of luxe fabrics and embellishments the likes which Valentino has not always seen but couture is known for.  Ornate looks and decoration were key with designers really detailing the tailoring and &quot;cabinets of curiosity&quot; as they called them, in full force.
