We've discovered the Higgs-Boson particle, and awesome electric cars, and amazing smartphones. So all this collective learning and progress has been good for everyone, right? Maybe not. We'll look at some of the pros and cons of all this &quot;progress,&quot; including environmental impact, changes in the way people live and work, and political changes and wars that come along with the modern world. We've come a long way, but there's a long way to go. Crash Course will also take a look at what's going to happen in the near future. If we manage to make our way through the coming bottlenecks, we could be OK in coming centuries. Don't get too hopeful, though. The Sun will eventually die, and the Earth will be destroyed, and later the universe will eventually experience heat death. But we won't talk about those downers until next week.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:12:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Lecture</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Astronomy, Ecology & Environment, History, Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-06-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:15:00</td></tr></table>
