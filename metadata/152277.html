About series:
&quot;The Looming Tower&quot; traces the rising threat of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida in the late '90s and how a rivalry between the FBI and CIA during the time period may have inadvertently set the path for the attacks of 9/11. The series follows members of the I-49 Squad in New York and Alec Station in Washington, D.C. -- the counterterrorism divisions of the FBI and CIA, respectively -- as they travel around the world, fighting for ownership of information while seemingly working toward a common goal of preventing an imminent attack on American soil. The drama is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book of the same name by Lawrence Wright.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:46:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-05-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
