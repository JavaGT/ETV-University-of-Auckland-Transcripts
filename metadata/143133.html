Critics claim current regulations wrongfully insert the government into the internet economy. But proponents believe the rules are necessary to ensure internet service providers treat all web traffic equally and fairly.

In an effort to protect net neutrality, the Obama administration expanded the FCC's authority and internet service providers were classified as utilities, like telephone companies. That means they have to abide by fairness rules.

But, now, there's a new administration and a new chief of the FCC.

Ajit Pai, who took over the agency in January, has said he believes in a free and open internet but that the current rules have stifled innovation and growth. Those in favour of the Obama-era regulations say the opposite.

So who's right? Decide for yourself when both sides of the debate join The Stream to make the case for or against net neutrality.
