When two fishermen find the body of a local farmer in the river, Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd is sent to the small rural town of Brokenwood to investigate the death. Is this the suicide of a man guilty of his own wife's murder or is he the victim of foul play? As Mike uncovers a family's tragedies and secrets he also learns that Brokenwood is a place where shadows lurk just beneath the surface.

'The Brokenwood Mysteries', begins when two fishermen find the body of a local farmer in the river, and Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea) is sent to the small rural town of Brokenwood to investigate the death with local Detective Kristin Sims (Fern Sutherland). Is this the suicide of a man guilty of his own wife&rsquo;s murder or is he the victim of foul play? 
Like Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot, Shepherd has his own rather &lsquo;unique&rsquo; ways of unravelling the mystery, much to the exasperation of Sims. Before the credits roll in each feature length episode Shepherd will have his culprit, but with more red herrings than a Scandinavian canning factory, you&rsquo;ll be kept guessing right to the very end!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:59:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-09-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
