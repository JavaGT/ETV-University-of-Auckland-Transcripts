Matt Walsh of 'Veep' plays a man suffering from a mid-life crisis who unexpectedly finds love while travelling in France in Archie Border's romantic comedy 'Under the Eiffel Tower,' which also features Judith Godreche and Reid Scott. Matt Walsh makes an unlikely but effective transition to leading man in Archie Borders&rsquo; romantic comedy Under the Eiffel Tower. Playing an American liquor salesman having a midlife crisis and finding love in (no points for guessing correctly) France, the veteran comic actor, so priceless on HBO&rsquo;s Veep, gives hope to average-looking guys everywhere with his character winning the heart of a gorgeous French vineyard owner. The film ultimately suffers from its overly contrived plot mechanics, but the expert performances by its ensemble make it go down as easy as a smooth glass of Bordeaux. Walsh plays Stuart, who has just been let go from his job at a Louisville bourbon manufacturer. He takes up an offer from his friends Frank and Tillie (David Wain, Michaela Watkins) to accompany them on a vacation trip to Paris. When the emotionally wounded Stuart misinterprets the friendliness of their 24-year-old daughter (Dylan Gelula) and impulsively proposes to her, the bizarre gesture promptly gets him banished from the trip.

Still licking his wounds, Stuart continues on his journey alone, making friends with Scottish ex-soccer player Liam (Reid Scott, affecting a none-too-convincing accent). While travelling by train together, they meet Louise (Judith Godreche), for whose romantic attentions they immediately begin competing. Complications ensue, with both financially strapped men invited by Louise to stay at her vineyard in the countryside where she lives with an older, invalid American, Gerard (Gary Cole).
