(AO) It is the boldest test of endurance ever attempted. 10 participants enter the wilderness carrying only 10 items to use for survival. They are sent out in harsh, unforgiving terrain with a single mission - stay alone and alive as long as they can. These participants hunt, build shelters and fend off predators. They face extreme isolation and psychological distress as they plunge into the unknown and document the experience themselves. No camera crew. No producers. At stake is a monetary prize for whomever lasts the longest.
