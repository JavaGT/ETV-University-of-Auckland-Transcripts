The film is a stirring and true testament of what one man, and his family, can accomplish.

Eddie Koiki Mabo was born on Murray Island in the Torres Strait, but lived most of his life in exile on mainland Australia. Only after his death did the island wholeheartedly welcome him home. By then the island and Eddie Mabo had changed the legal and political landscape of Australia.

On June 3, 1992, five months after Eddie Mabo died tragically of cancer aged 55, the High Court of Australia upheld his claim that Murray Islanders held &lsquo;Native Title&rsquo; to three islands on the eastern fringe of the Torres Strait. This ended the theory of terra nullius, or land belonging to no one at the time of white settlement. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia greeted what became known as &lsquo;The Mabo Judgement&rsquo; with jubilation. The legal fiction that Australia was an &lsquo;empty land&rsquo; when first occupied by white people was laid to rest by the highest court in the land. After more than 200 years, European law had to recognise pre&ndash;existing indigenous law.

The world knows little about Eddie Mabo and his life. Filmmaker Trevor Graham was a friend of Eddie Mabo&rsquo;s during the last years of his life. Graham&rsquo;s film, Mabo &ndash; Life of an Island Man, tells the story of Eddie Mabo&rsquo;s public and private life and helps all who see it to understand the struggle he went through to achieve recognition of indigenous law and traditions.

The film includes part of Graham&rsquo;s earlier production Land Bilong Islanders (1989), which is the only film record of the Mabo legal proceeding. Trevor Graham describes an important motive behind the film:

The real reason for wanting to make the film was [my] being absolutely horrified and devastated when his [Eddie Mabo&rsquo;s] grave was desecrated. I fell into a crumbling heap. The morning after Mabo&rsquo;s funeral, his headstone was vandalised. Red swastikas were painted on it and a sculptured image of Mabo&rsquo;s face was hacked off. Chronicling this event and its aftermath takes up about a quarter of the film.

Mabo &ndash; Life of an Island Man traces the story of the life of an extraordinary man, Eddie Koiki Mabo. The film is a celebration of his achievements. It highlights how Mabo pursued the case to have his ownership of property on Mer (Murray Island) legally recognised, and how that claim grew into a case that change his struggle for land rights, and how that claim grew into a case that changed Indigenous rights in Australia.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:38:48</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Criminology, Geography, History, Law, Political Studies, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
