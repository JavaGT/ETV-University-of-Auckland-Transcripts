Wellington's deadly hostel fire is being investigated to see how safe the building was. Internal Affairs Minister Barbara Edmonds says, &ldquo;sprinklers in any fire situation, no matter what the building is, will be helpful&rdquo;. Police are planning to enter the Loafers Lodge building in the next few hours if deemed safe.
