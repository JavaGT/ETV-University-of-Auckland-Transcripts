Some, like the Abel Tasman coastal track, are easy, while others, such as the famous Milford Track in Fiordland, and the strangely beautiful crossing of volcanic Tongariro, are more challenging.  Huts are within a day's walk and open to all comers, although on a few tracks, accommodation can be booked in advance. With its varied scenery, New Zealand offers magnificent walking country.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:14:11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-10-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:39:12</td></tr></table>
