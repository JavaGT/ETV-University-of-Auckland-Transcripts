It's called slash - the waste wood left behind by the forestry industry after pine trees have been harvested. 

In rivers. On farms. On the coastline. Piled up outside people's homes. Everywhere.

In total, we spent 19 days in the region, talking to people, filming, covering the damage of two cyclones for 1 News, and observing the impacts of this debris. The more we saw, the more damage we realised it was doing. 

People are exhausted by it. 

It&rsquo;s a big and complex issue, not only in Gisborne.
