Foyle meets Josef Novak for a chess game. Novak is a Polish-Jewish psychiatrist at a nearby military mental-health institution where Dr Worth is found murdered. Foyle is called in, having to delegate the finding of a missing East End boy (formerly a child-evacuee in the Hastings area) to Sam. Meanwhile Fred Dawson, a crippled former POW, arrives back at his farm to find his wife and child being helped in the farm work by Johann, a German POW. Suspecting his wife Rose of an affair with Johann and resenting his easy manner with Fred and Rose's son, the couple argue, and Johann is later found dead after escaping the camp.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:09:37</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, English, History, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:10:00</td></tr></table>
