Domestic rivalries and external players pollute the Sudanese information space.
A year into the civil war in Sudan, the humanitarian costs have been staggering &ndash; but the news coverage has been minimal.

A conflict on this scale should top the news agenda but it has been relegated to the back pages &ndash; in part &ndash; because of what is happening in Gaza and Ukraine.
