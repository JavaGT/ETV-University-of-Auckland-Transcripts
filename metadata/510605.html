Retrace his journey, from humble folk beginnings in Hibbing, to the bustling electric Greenwich Village. Discover his musical predecessors and the events that sparked a young Bob Dylan to venture into his own psyche. As the times changed, Dylan's anti-war and pro-civil rights message has become ever more present. Unable to be pinned down, Bob's sound evolved, rewriting the songwriting rule book in the process. Armed with only his guitar and harmonica, he defied the normal conventions set before him and championed for the weak and downtrodden. Dylan has pushed music to its boundaries, and become the only musician to have been awarded a Nobel prize.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PG</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-05-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:30:00</td></tr></table>
