Godzilla (ゴジラ Gojira) is a 1954 tokusatsu kaiju film produced by Toho, and the first instalment in the Godzilla series as well as the Showa series. The film was released to Japanese theatres on November 3, 1954, and to American theatres as Godzilla, King of the Monsters! on April 27, 1956.

Responsible for launching the long-running Godzilla series as well as the genres of both kaiju eiga and tokusatsu in general, Godzilla was an incredibly successful and influential film both in Japan and internationally. The film tells the story of Godzilla, a huge prehistoric beast roused from his ancient slumber by H-bomb testing in the South Pacific, who proceeds to lay waste to Tokyo. Only the young scientist Daisuke Serizawa holds the key to possibly defeating the invincible monster, a deadly chemical weapon called the Oxygen Destroyer. However, even as the destruction mounts, Serizawa fears revealing his invention to the world out of fear it will become a far worse threat to humanity than nuclear weapons.
