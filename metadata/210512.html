He may be one of the most recognizable names in modern art but we know surprisingly little about the biography of Amedeo Modigliani. One hundred years after his death, historians and curators are now keen to understand the man behind the legend. This fascinating documentary explores the myths surrounding the artist and charts the evolution of his style and influences. Retracing his life from his Sephardic-Jewish upbringing in Venice to his friends and patrons in Bohemian Paris, the film also draws on unprecedented scientific research to understand some of his artistic choices.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Art, Careers, Design, French, History, Italian, Languages, Media Studies, Psychology, Sociology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-08-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
