The first episode starts promisingly with one guy mooning the camera, another vomiting vodka from a street bench, and a girl shrieking and writhing on the pavement as she demands to be taken home to &quot;44 Road&quot;. Thankfully they're blurring the faces of their drunkest talent, and providing subtitles. But paramedic student Steff is here to show we need not entirely despair of the youth of today. She pairs up with full-time paramedic Benjamin. 

Billed as an observational documentary series, TV2 show 'Street Hospital' is really reality TV in the same vein as 'Motorway Patrol', just replacing policemen with paramedics, speeding with slurring, and car chases with chunder. The 10 episode series follows Wellington Free Ambulance officers who, on Friday and Saturday nights, man parked ambulances that become &quot;makeshift hospitals&quot;. They also patrol the streets in pairs looking for anyone in trouble. And they find them.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, New Zealand, Sociology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-09-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
