Lives lost, livelihoods ruined &ndash; back-to-back storms have devastated the country, and the cleanup has barely begun. But already there are questions about the future &ndash; and we may not be ready for what&rsquo;s to come. Experts warn that nature&rsquo;s role is only a small aspect, and that much of the damage is man-made. So why did our defences let us down?

WEE GEMS
Kieran Wright is making it big in Los Angeles by cutting the City Of Angels down to size. He creates miniature models of famous LA landmarks and sells them to the city&rsquo;s most famous residents, the A-listers. They&rsquo;re not what you would expect, burger joints, theatres, music venues and hotdog stands but they celebrate a golden age when the car was king and Los Angeles was the centre of the entertainment world. For this offshore Kiwi, his creative career has become more than a living, it&rsquo;s also a way to help save LA&rsquo;s architectural heritage.

WOMB TO MOVE
Six weeks ago, in a history-making operation, 30-year-old Kirsty Bryant became the first woman in Australia to receive a womb transplant. Thanks to amazing science, her dream of having a second child is now possible. But in a twist for the ages, the donor is Kirsty&rsquo;s own mum. An inspirational story to remind us that unconditional love and the marvels of modern medicine can make incredible allies. And hopefully, beautiful babies.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Magazine, News, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Health, History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-03-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:03:00</td></tr></table>
