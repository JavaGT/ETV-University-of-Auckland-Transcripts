As New Zealand's prison numbers continue to grow, leaving us among the highest in the Western World, what are we doing to stem the tide? 

Hindsight takes current issues facing Kiwis today and examines them through the lens of history.  Have we been here before?  Did we find the right solution, or where did we go wrong?  By combining the best of the TVNZ archives and interviews with those who were there, as well as today's current experts, the show aims to shed some light on the issues facing New Zealand today.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:14:38</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ HEARTLAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-12-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
