The can-can has always been known for its high-energy and physically demanding performance. Sometime throughout the course of history, the traditional French dance made its way into the cabaret clubs of New Zealand. One such club, Encore Entertainment, brings to stage entertainers that wow you with song, dance, comedy and sequins.Tonight, live for the Paul Henry Show, the club's performance went out with a bang.
