Chef Michael Van De Elzen embarks on creating a delicious and healthy Mexican feast.

Michael Van De Elzen and his trusty 1970 Bedford truck return for all new episodes of The Food Truck! This year, Michael's taking on international dishes that are takeaway favourites, but are not so good for the waistline. Michael's aim is to make dishes such as Mexican tacos, Chinese dumplings and creamy Italian pastas just as tasty as the originals, but without the guilt. The Food Truck itself is off on a road trip, visiting New Zealand hot spots including Christchurch, Wellington and Rotorua to spread the healthy food love. As always, it's up to the punters to decide if Michael's food is a success. As the masses turn out to see what the Food Truck has to offer, Michael has one shot to create classic, healthy dishes that will impress the nation.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science, Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-08-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
