It is therefore crucial that all nurses working in a general hospital setting are familiar with the different types of mental illnesses in order to provide optimum patient care and coordinate with members of the mental health team. 

This incisive and accessible program from VEA introduces schizophrenia and mood disorders, including depression and mania/hypomania, providing nurses with diagnostic criteria and a detailed understanding of how a patient may present when suffering from a mental illness. The program concludes with nursing interventions and traditional treatment protocols, including assessment and medication.
