It was in this environment that singer Chris Bailey and guitarist Ed Kuepper met and bonded over a love of music. 'The Saints' brand of loud rock was shunned by the local music industry so the group took it upon themselves to record their first single, '(I'm) Stranded'. They sent the record to media in the UK and within weeks, 'The Saints' were the darlings of the international music press. EMI records in London signed the band - the first time an Australian artist had been approached directly from overseas. 'The Saints' recorded their debut LP '(I'm) Stranded' for EMI in two ear-shattering days. Within six months, 'The Saints' were in London at the epicentre of the punk revolution. The group's individualistic, Australian scepticism alienated them from the fashion-conscious punk rock scene and the band imploded in the UK. However, their legend has lived on and their legacy is Australia's independent music industry which grew directly out of 'The Saints'' bold move. The extraordinary story of 'The Saints' and making of '(I'm) Stranded' is retold by their songwriters Chris Bailey, Ed Kuepper and the musicians they inspired, among them Brad Shepard ('Hoodoo Gurus'), Robert Forster (the 'Go Betweens'), Damien Lovelock ('Celibate Rifles') and Rob Younger ('Radio Birdman').</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Media Studies, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-12-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>07:30:00</td></tr></table>
