About series:
&quot;No one can go back and make a brand new start to life, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.&rdquo; Carl Bard

We like to call it food for the soul. Stories from everyday people who share their most darkest and challenging experiences in life, and thought provoking teaching on subjects such as &ldquo;dealing with failure&rdquo;, &ldquo;following your dream&quot; and &ldquo;Living a Legacy&rdquo;. Presented by Paul de Jong - Senior Pastor of LIFE, LIFETV broadcasts around the world including New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, England, Canada and the USA. We hope you gain as much from listening to these incredible stories as we have capturing them. Please feel free to share LIFETV content with whoever you feel will benefit from watching it.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-12-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
