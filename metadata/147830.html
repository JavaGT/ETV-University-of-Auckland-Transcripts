Chip and Joanna Gaines own and operate Magnolia Homes, a remodeling and design business in Waco, Texas, and &quot;Fixer Upper&quot; shows the process by which the couple turn dilapidated but potential-rich houses into showplaces that are helping revitalize whole neighborhoods throughout central Texas. Chip manages the construction and realty side of Magnolia and Joanna is the lead designer. They also act as part-time counselors to clients who can't see a structure's beauty beyond the blemishes. Combined, Chip and Joanna save homes that look hopeless, renovating the imperfect, and revealing them as what they were always intended to be.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:36</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Design, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>HGTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-11-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
