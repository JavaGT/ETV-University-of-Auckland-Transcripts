We explore the remains of Nicola Tesla&rsquo;s revolutionary power generator on Long Island to ask if his plans to provide limitless power for the world would have worked. The ornate control room at the heart of Hungary&rsquo;s oldest power station reveals the belief that electricity would create a new and better world. We ask why a brilliant mathematician has been forgotten even though the structural design he invented is being used to create some of the world&rsquo;s greatest buildings.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:44</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>Design, Engineering, Geography, History, Information Technology, Science, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Duke</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-06-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:15:00</td></tr></table>
