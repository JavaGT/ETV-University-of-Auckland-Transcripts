Towns such as Geraldine, Timaru and Ashburton were cut off. Roads were closed, bridges washed away and many homes were covered in water right up to the rooftops leaving residents marooned for several days. There has been serious loss of stock and food crops - a national disaster for a country at war. 02.30 Polish Camps: Prime Minister Peter Fraser tours the Polish Childrens' Camp at Paihiatua where 800 young refugees are living safely away from the European war. Some children perform national dances in their national costumes. 03.10 Navy, Howe, Achilles and Gambia in NZ Waters: HMS Howe, the 35,000 tonne flagship of the British Pacific fleet arrives in Auckland along with the famous Achilles, veteran of the River Plate and Solomons action, returning home after 2 years. A naval parade is Auckland's opportunity for an official welcome and 70,000 people pack Queen St. The Howe puts to sea for exercises with the NZ cruiser Gambia. The crews practice defence against incoming fighter aircraft and multiple pompom guns spray out a curtain of fire. The exercise finishes with the launching of torpedos.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
