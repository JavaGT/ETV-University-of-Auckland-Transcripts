In this episode of Real Crime: Beyond the Darklands, clinical psychologist Nigel Latta examines why McGrath started abusing children, how he managed to silence his victims - and how he continued to abuse for more than two decades. Latta goes behinds the headlines and talks to McGrath's victims - men who speak bravely and openly, but admit that their lives were shattered by their time in his care. Says victim Sean Herbert: &quot;He's just betrayed a lot of people's trust. Not just for a length of his time on this planet, but for people who have got to still get to live the rest of their lives.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-02-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
