The Animal Condition shines a light on the grey areas of the animal rights debate, when four friends take a trip around Australia to speak to every side on the subject. Often shocking and confronting, it will certainly change your views about eating meat.

The Animal Condition chronicles three and a half years of recent Australian history, when animal welfare grew from a fringe issue to a national focus. Four young people take an investigative road trip around Australia. Unafraid to ask questions they speak to all sides, from politicians to activists, farmers, Indigenous Australians, philosophers, scientists and immigrant-workers. Views on the subject change with each new encounter, leading to questions about society that go beyond the treatment of animals.
