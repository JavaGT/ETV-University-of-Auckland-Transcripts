When Sherlock deduces that a former henchman of Moriarty's is behind a child kidnapping, Moriarty is brought in, with electroshock restraints, to help track down the kidnappers. Watson can see Sherlock is still struggling with his conflicting feelings for Moriarty, but is also annoyed they've been discussing Watson's love life in their letters. It is discovered that Moriarty's agent has gone rogue, and that the child in question is actually Moriarty's daughter. After disabling her restraints, escaping and killing all her daughter's abductors, a badly injured Moriarty allows Sherlock to take her back into custody, predicting she will be free soon. Sherlock realizes she may have started to redeem herself.

'Elementary' is an American crime drama created by Robert Doherty and loosely based on Sherlock Holmes and other characters appearing in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
