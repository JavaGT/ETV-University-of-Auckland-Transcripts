Nick Pluker has one of the most dangerous jobs in the world; he is a wild sea-going cowboy who each year heads out into the perilous Southern Ocean to round up his herd - Southern bluefin tuna. The challenge is to muster the fish, defend the lucrative catch from sharks - eager for a taste of the valuable stock - and return safely to the tuna farm on the coast with every single fish alive and unscathed. For the first time ever the drama of one of these treacherous musters is captured on camera. Tuna Cowboys ventures 250 miles out to sea to witness the action-packed muster and the fearless wrangles as the cowboys take on the sharks while slowly making their way home.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-03-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:30:00</td></tr></table>
