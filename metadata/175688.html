There has been much speculation about the scale and target of Iran's retaliation to the assassination of its top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.

And there is also speculation about whether the killing of the head of Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force could bring all-out war to the Middle East.

Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at two air bases hosting US forces in Iraq early on Wednesday.

It is the most direct attack on the US by Iran in decades. Initial statements by both countries seem to say they do not want further escalation.

The Iranian foreign minister's exact words were Iran &quot;took and concluded proportionate measures in self-defence&quot;.

Tehran has made it clear it will attack again if Washington responds.

As for US President Donald Trump, he tweeted &quot;All is well!&quot; after Iran struck.

Is all really well? And will this &quot;revenge operation&quot; stop there?
