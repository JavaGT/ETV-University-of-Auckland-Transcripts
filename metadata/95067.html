About University Challenge:
Twenty-five years since last on New Zealand television, University Challenge, the general knowledge contest among New Zealand universities, is set for a return next month with a brand new series screening on Prime.

Executive Producer Tom Conroy is confident the time is right for the show&rsquo;s re-introduction given the current popularity of quiz shows. &quot;Essentially it&rsquo;s the same format as first time round though today&rsquo;s version is more relaxed and viewer friendly as we want folk at home to be able to answer some of the questions yet admire the level of knowledge the students exhibit. However, traditionalists will still be able to enjoy all the regular features like the split-screen contest for the &lsquo;starter for 10&rsquo;.&quot;

The round-robin competition followed by semis and a final were recorded over 31 episodes with Conroy impressed with the talent on display. &quot;The students really got into the spirit of the event, creating their own fun yet keeping a competitive edge.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:31:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Quiz</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Anthropology, Archaeology, Art, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Classical Studies, Ecology & Environment, Economics, Engineering, English, Food Science, Geography, Health, History, Information Technology, Languages, Law, Literature, Maori, Mathematics, Media Studies, Music, Natural History, New Zealand, Philosophy, Physical Education, Physics, Political Studies, Religion & Theology, Science, Sport, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-11-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:30:00</td></tr></table>
