It details what postnatal depression is, the symptoms, and how it differs from other mood changes associated with the parents of newborns. 

We speak with mothers who have experienced postnatal depression, as well as Psychiatrist Dr Kristine Mecuri, Post and Ante Natal Depression Association's (PANDA) CEO Belinda Horton, and Beyond Blue's Nicole Highett. 

This program explores contributing factors, treatments available and includes an in-depth case study of a mother who experienced postnatal depression. Ideal for those in health care, psychology, medicine and midwifery, this program seeks to dispel myths and misconceptions around the illness.
