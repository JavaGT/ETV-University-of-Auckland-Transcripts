&lsquo;The Dunedin Study&rsquo; is world famous. This long-term research project is following the lives of more than a thousand New Zealanders since their birth in the early 1970s. Now middle-aged, these Dunedin sons and daughters have been part of the study for 50 years and counting. From it, the world has learnt, in unprecedented breadth, how our childhood shapes the rest of our lives. But the long-serving director, Professor Richie Poulton, who describes the study as the professional love of his life, is now dying.
