Rick is captivated by its narrow winding streets as he walks in the footsteps of Phoenician and Arab traders who made a lasting impression on the city.

Tavernas offer tantalising tapas, including chickpea stews, cured pork lardons, freshly grilled mackerel and rice dishes flavoured with garlic, saffron and parsley. Rick times his visit perfectly to enjoy the city's two most revered culinary stars - fresh tuna and manzanilla.

At home, Rick cooks arroz verde - green rice - and flamenco eggs, a dish of eggs with tomatoes and vegetables.

Rick Stein embarks on a series of culinary long weekends in search of food excellence, heading to markets, restaurants, wineries, cafes and bars.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:46</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-03-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:00:00</td></tr></table>
