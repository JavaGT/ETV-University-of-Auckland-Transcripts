We should pay attention to avatars | Sinead Bovell | TEDxRut - TEDx | I study the future. We should pay attention to avatars | Sinead Bovell</td><td align='left' valign='top'>As the world around us becomes more digitized, immersed and connected, the lines between what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not become more blurred&mdash;down to the models on our magazine covers and human-like avatars conducting corporate interviews. Sinead Bovell calls attention to Shudu Gram, a computer-generated and internationally-recognized South African woman model, who was created and monetized by a white male. She explains how new technologies may provide an opportunity to exploit people&rsquo;s racial and gender identities, and what we can do to prevent it.
