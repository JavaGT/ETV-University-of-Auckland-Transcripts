When a different CIA team, led by Devereaux's former protege (Luke Bracey), shows up, the mission goes south and Devereaux's ex-lover is killed. Now a rogue agent, Devereaux drags a relief worker (Olga Kurylenko) along on his mission to settle the score.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:04:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-10-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:20:00</td></tr></table>
