From the very first days of the war the USSR capital had been preparing to defence.

Institutions and plants, embassies and ministries were evacuated. In order to organize the defence of Moscow and stifle the fascist offensive, Marshal Zhukov was called from Leningrad to Moscow.

According to the plan of German Operation Typhoon, all power of Army Group Centre thrust was directed towards Moscow. Zhukov needed reserve and time, but he had none of them. And the German troops were being reinforced again and again.

The usual autumn rains started, negatively affecting actions of both armies. On 17th October 1941 a state of siege was declared in Moscow, and the implications of the motto &ldquo;Not a step back!&rdquo; became extremely severe.

On 7th of October, an anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, a military parade was held on the Red Square in Moscow, and the participating troops went directly to the frontline after it. And fierce resistance of the Red Army troops along all axes made at last the German Command acknowledge the plan to encircle Moscow impossible.

About the series:
Epic stories from the Second World War&rsquo;s biggest and bloodiest theatre, told from an unprecedented Russian perspective. 10 new episodes explore some of the most devastating battles of the war &ndash; from the Red Army&rsquo;s catastrophic encirclement at Kiev in 1941 to the notorious &lsquo;Rzhev meat-grinder&rsquo;. We also look at the dramatic recovery of the Soviet air force from its almost total destruction in the first days of the war, the role of Baltic Sea Fleet submarines, the brutal partisan war fought against a backdrop of Nazi genocide, and the crucial role of Soviet secret intelligence.

The Nazi-Soviet war was a conflict of staggering scale and savagery. Four out of five German soldiers killed in World War Two died on the Eastern Front. The Red Army suffered ten times as many dead as the Western Allies combined. The total dead on all sides was more than 30 million, most of them civilians. The war was seen by both sides as a struggle for existence. It meant that both Hitler and Stalin were prepared to accept losses on any scale in the pursuit of victory.

Soviet Storm: WW2 in the East tells the story of this titanic clash of arms blow by blow. Across 18 episodes we explore the biggest battles, the key personalities and the decisive weapons of the war, including legendary tanks like the T-34 and the Tiger, and less well-known Soviet aircraft such as the Ilyushin 2 &lsquo;flying tank&rsquo; or the superb Lavochkin La-5 fighter.

From the German invasion of 22nd June 1941 (&lsquo;Operation Barbarossa&rsquo;, the largest military operation in history) through to the brutal fighting outside the gates of Moscow, the savage street-fighting of Stalingrad, and the long, bloody road to Berlin, this is an epic retelling of the world&rsquo;s most devastating conflict.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:36</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-09-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
