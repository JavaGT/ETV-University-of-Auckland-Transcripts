On April 25th 1915, thousands of New Zealand soldiers landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula in a place that would later become known as ANZAC Cove. Over the next nine months more than 5000 Kiwis were injured and almost 3000 lost their lives. Zinzan's grandfather Martin Brooke was one of the first to enlist in the Pukekohe area and was part of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles. After his training in Egypt, Martin landed at Gallipoli and saw active service on the perilous Walker's Ridge area. Now 100 years on, Martin's stories and Zinzan's insight provide a unique and moving look at this terrible page in New Zealand's military history.
