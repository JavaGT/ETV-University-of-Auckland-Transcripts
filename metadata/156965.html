Inspired by the cult film &quot;The Magician.&quot; It centers around Ray Shoesmith -- a father, ex-husband, boyfriend and best friend. All tough roles to juggle in the modern age, but it's even harder when you're a criminal for hire. Shoesmith is a man who has been hardened by the prison system and his experiences there. Now, he is learning how to deal with life in the real world -- even attending anger management classes -- away from the bars of prison, where actions always have consequences.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-10-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:00:00</td></tr></table>
