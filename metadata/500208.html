Some gold is also recovered in the sluicing process. A ministerial party from Wellington tours the mining operation. At Stockton, the overburden to be removed consists of hard sandstone which needs explosive shots to loosen. The ministerial party takes cover from the blasts. Bulldozers clear the shattered rock away and samples of the exposed coal are taken. It is estimated there is about 10 million tones of coal to be won from the Stockton field using this open-cast method.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:08:16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
