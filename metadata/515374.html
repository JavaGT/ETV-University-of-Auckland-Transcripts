Between five and seven people in Aotearoa are killed each year by someone suffering from a treatable psychotic disorder. One of our country&rsquo;s top psychiatrists has described mental health services for our highest-risk as frequently disorganised, chaotic and under-resourced. The consequences of this can be devastating and deadly, as three families share this week. Following their pleas for help from health services, unfathomable acts of violence took place. The victims' loved ones say these deaths were completely avoidable and our mental health system is broken.
