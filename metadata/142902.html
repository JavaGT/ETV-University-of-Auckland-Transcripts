About the Series:
New Zealand Music Month is celebrated in May.
It&rsquo;s May the 1st 2017 and that means NZ Music Month is officially underway &ndash; New Zealand&rsquo;s annual celebration of homegrown music and the people who make it!

It&rsquo;s 31 days of celebrating local music in our venues, schools, libraries, parks, on our screens and on our stereos. With over 800 events around the country listed on our gig guide already, this year&rsquo;s celebrations are busier than ever. 

To celebrate NZ Music Month, Rialto are excited to be presenting Marty Duda&rsquo;s 13th Floor Sessions.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Music, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-05-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:55:00</td></tr></table>
