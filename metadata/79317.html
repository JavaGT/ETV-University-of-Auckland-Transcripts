'A Day that Shook the World'. On September 27th, 1930 the American golfer Bobby Jones made sporting history at the final round of the US Open. Over the previous 8 years he had won countless titles.  Never before and never since has a golfer won the grand slam - all 4 major world tournaments in one season. In fact up to that time, there was no term for such a sporting feat and so the term Grand Slam was used to capture the accomplishment. What was so remarkable about this international sporting hero was that he was a true amateur, fitting golf around his business meetings and his work as a lawyer.

'A Day That Shook The World' is the classic series that recalls the days of the 20th century that proved to be era-defining and pivotal in the course of modern history.
