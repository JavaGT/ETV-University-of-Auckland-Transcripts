For more than 15 years, the United States has been imposing a wide variety of economic sanctions against Venezuela, claiming the South American country has aided in drug trafficking, sponsored terrorism, and committed human rights abuses. In 2017, then-US President Donald Trump ramped up these sanctions in an aim to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, adding that a &ldquo;possible military option&rdquo; was on the table. But US efforts to dismantle Venezuela&rsquo;s elected government fell short, and civilians have borne the ill-effects of US sanctions.

According to a report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, sanctions led to more than 40,000 deaths from 2017-2018. They&rsquo;ve also increased diseases and worsened mortality, forced millions of people to leave the country, and are a major factor in an economic collapse that has left people scrambling to find food and medicine.

In this episode of The Stream we&rsquo;ll look at the impact of sanctions on Venezuelans, and ask whether they are an effective foreign policy tool or simply collective punishment.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:50</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-06-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
