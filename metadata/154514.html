About series:
A tale of secrets, lies and high fashion from writer Oliver Goldstick (Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty). Paris, 1947. A fashion empire rises from the ashes of this war-torn city. The House of Sabine is run by two very different brothers. Breathtakingly charming and thoroughly ruthless, Paul Sabine controls the business. Meanwhile it is his reckless, hedonistic younger brother Claude whose fresh vision is ushering  in a new era in haute couture. But behind the glamour and success lie devastating secrets that threaten to tear this family apart. Paul and Claude survived one war &ndash; but at what cost? Another battle is looming. This time it&rsquo;s brother against brother, husband against wife, prot&eacute;g&eacute; against mentor. Sophisticated and contemporary in tone, The Collection is a story about the price of success, set during a pivotal moment in France&rsquo;s history when fashion became a vehicle for transformation and reinvention.
