You won't hear the phrase &quot;free shipping&quot; uttered in this real-life series. It follows heavy-duty movers as they battle for the chance to transport items that traditional carriers won't touch, from bulky loads such as a Civil War cannon to bizarre items like a water buffalo. The competition begins each day when thousands of shipments are put up for auction online, and the truckers who make the lowest bids get the loads. It's a high-stakes game, figuring out what shipments are worth the time and money to move them, but the bottom line is these haulers -- rookies and seasoned vets alike -- will deliver anything if the price is right.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:48</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Careers, Economics, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-12-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
