on empire of the sun episode :

professor brian cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system.

in this first episode brian explores the powerhouse of them all, the sun. in india he witnesses a total solar eclipse - when the link to the light and heat that sustains us is cut off for a few precious minutes.

but heat and light are not the only power of the sun over the solar system. in norway, brian watches the battle between the sun's wind and earth, as the night sky glows with the northern lights.

beyond earth, the solar wind continues, creating dazzling aurora on other planets. brian makes contact with voyager, a probe that has been travelling since its launch 30 years ago. now 14 billion kilometres away, voyager has just detected the solar wind is beginning to peter out. but even here we haven't reached the end of the sun's rule.

brian explains how its greatest power, gravity, reaches out for hundreds of billions of kilometres, where the lightest gravitational touch encircles our solar system in a mysterious cloud of comets.

notes from www.tvnz7.co.nz  on this series :

for millennia mankind has been fascinated by the stars. 
travel deep into space with this five-part series, and see the many wonders beyond our planet with your own eyes. 
prepare to immerse yourself in an alien world as if you were standing there yourself. 

giant ice fountains rising over 100km high, an ocean hidden beneath a frozen crust of ice, storms three times the size of earth coloured blood red by a vortex of dust and gases, and immense volcanoes that would put mount everest in the shade - this series reveals the true and awesome beauty of our solar system. 

alongside these startlingly authentic images, some of the most spectacular, extreme locations on earth help to reveal wonders never thought possible. 

over five episodes, the series explores how these previously unseen phenomena have dramatically expanded our horizons, revealing more about the planets, their moons and how they came to be the way they are. 

the series also looks at the big picture - how the forces of nature carved out beauty and order from the chaos of space, how our home planet doesn't sit in magnificent isolation but is intimately connected with the rest of the solar system, and how these connections have created the haven we call earth.
