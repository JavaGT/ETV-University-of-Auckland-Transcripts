About series:
&quot;The Alaska Triangle&quot; is a Travel Channel series that explores an area in Alaska known for unusual activity, including mysterious disappearances, sightings of strange creatures, lights in the sky, and encounters with ghosts. Some experts speculate that ley lines or electromagnetic anomalies may be causing these bizarre occurrences within the Triangle. The paranormal series investigates enduring mysteries, such as the disappearance of the Douglas C-54 Skymaster in 1950. The Douglas vanished en route from Alaska to Montana, with 44 people aboard, and no trace of the aircraft, its crew or its passengers has ever been found. Another mystery involves a Bigfoot creature that is rumored to have caused a once thriving coastal town to become deserted. In another episode, an eyewitness shares startling video evidence of extraterrestrial activity in Fairbanks, Alaska, while a UFO hunter flies over Alaska's highest mountain in search of a secret underground alien base.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, History, Media Studies, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-04-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:25:00</td></tr></table>
