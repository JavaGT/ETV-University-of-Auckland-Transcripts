UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the world is facing a climate emergency and falling short on the commitments of the Paris climate accord.

&ldquo;We are not on track to achieve the objectives defined in the Paris Agreement,&rdquo; said Guterres during a three-day trip to New Zealand this month.

But, with political will to respond to the problem fading, there&rsquo;s a growing movement of young people ready to address the inaction. Social movements have sprung up around the world as activists take often radical measures to achieve reform. 

&ldquo;Earthrise&rdquo; explores the impact these movements are having in a new episode - &ldquo;Voice of the People&rdquo; - now airing on Al Jazeera.   

On this episode of The Stream we talk to those at the heart of these social justice initiatives and ask them if the fight against climate change is the civil rights movement of today&rsquo;s generation.
