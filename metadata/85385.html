Barbie's fate is left in the hands of Big Jim and Junior, after being falsely charged with numerous crimes committed by Big Jim. However, the dome releases a mysterious sound, which scares Junior from pulling the lever and causes Linda to halt the execution. The dome has become magnetized, causing execution observers to pass out.

Under the Dome tells the story of the residents of the small town of Chester's Mill in Maine, where a massive, transparent, indestructible dome suddenly cuts them off from the rest of the world. With no Internet access, no mobile signals and limited radio communication, the people trapped inside must find their own ways to survive with diminishing resources and rising tensions. While military forces, the government and the media positioned outside of this surrounding barrier attempt to break it down, a small group of people inside attempt to figure out what the dome is, where it came from, and when (and if) it will go away.
