Through this series of four short documentaries, &lsquo;Te Waiora&rsquo; aims to showcase these individuals, educators and passionate advocates of the transformative power of the water.

Brother and sister Mamah and Ngapuke Patea have a love of the awa (river) passed down through generations and instilled by their father.

Growing up, their father taught them about the importance of the awa and the power that it holds. Together with their older brother Ash, they formed &lsquo;Kii Tai Cultural Tours&rsquo; to transform their passion into mahi (work) and help others reconnect to their whakapapa.

Leading a group of rangatahi on a waka journey on the Whanganui River, they teach practical skills as well as deepening their understanding of their cultural heritage. For Mamah Patea, this is important work and a reflection of a promise she made to her father that she would continue his life&rsquo;s work and ensure that the importance of the awa was protected for generations to come.
