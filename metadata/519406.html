Protesters took to the streets in Tblisi after Georgia&rsquo;s Parliament approved &lsquo;foreign agents&rsquo; law.
Georgia&rsquo;s Parliament has signed off on a controversial bill, sparking outrage in the capital.

In April, the government announced it was reviving legislation that would require media and nongovernmental organisations to register themselves as foreign agents if they receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad.

That led to weeks of mass demonstrations.

The government says the law is needed to promote transparency and preserve sovereignty. But critics say the bill drives Georgia closer to Russia.

How will it affect the country&rsquo;s hopes of joining the European Union?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-05-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:30:00</td></tr></table>
