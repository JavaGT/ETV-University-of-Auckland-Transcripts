The Awards celebrate the formidable efforts of those that are striving towards an industry that&rsquo;s fit for the future, and in this video we meet the designers and brands who are doing just that.

Join us as we explore the legacies of four circular design pioneers whose brands contributed to the Foundation's Circular Design for Fashion Book and were recognised at this year&rsquo;s Awards - EILEEN FISHER, NKWO, Timberland and Vestiaire Collective.

Their stories highlight how fashion can be redefined through circular design and encourage creatives everywhere to rethink how they can design for a regenerative, circular economy.
