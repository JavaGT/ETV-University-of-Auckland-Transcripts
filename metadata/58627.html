Also contained in the circuit is an iron contact switch connected to a spring arm, with a gap on one side of it. When the circuit is closed, the inner solenoid attracts the iron switch across the small gap. This breaks the circuit, making the switch move back to its original position, which closes the circuit again. Thus, the switch moves back and forth quickly, causing oscillations of high voltage in the outer solenoid.

This specific transmitter was made by the Marconi company, and is very much like the telegraph machine that would have been used on the Titanic. Read more about spark gap transmitters here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_gap_transmitter
