They have committed to transforming their first home in Manchester into somewhere which reflects a truly sustainable lifestyle. Using savings left to them by Tom&rsquo;s grandparents, the pair want to transform their outside space into a living larder. But the unruly plot is now a ramshackle tangle of dangerous hard landscaping and uneven levels. As the couple tie the knot in a few months, it&rsquo;s a huge year for them, and they are determined that they set the tone for their future together by getting this garden just right.

Stepping up to help are award-winning garden designers Tom Massey and Steve Williams. Tom is interested in unlocking the potential of the awkward level changes, while Steve is inspired by the existing canopy of trees overhead. Using virtual reality, both designers pitch their radically different approaches. Tom reinvents the space into a contemporary sustainable wonderland, while Steve comes up with a layered edible food forest. Both designs are brought to life in the virtual world, allowing Rachael and Tom to step inside two versions of the garden. Either garden would be a perfect fit, but which will the couple choose?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:18:44</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Design, Media Studies, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-07-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
