But has prejudice following two World Wars made us neglect its 500 year cultural legacy? Andrew Graham-Dixon believes so. 

In this series, he explores the great themes of Germanic art - an obsession with landscape, folk lore and national identity - by following a geographical as well as chronological journey through Germany, focusing on the cultural centres of each particular era. From Germany's art beginnings through the Baroque, Romanticism, Expressionism and Dada movements to the modern day, Andrew's journey takes him from the Rhine to Bavaria, from Prussia to Berlin and culminates in a meeting with Gerhard Richter, the country's greatest living artist.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:15:00</td></tr></table>
