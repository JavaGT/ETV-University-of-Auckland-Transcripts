Uninspired and frustrated, he surveys the sea, and sums it all up as 'boring'. Then, from the darkness appears a strange woman, perhaps she is from this world, perhaps from another. Whatever she is, she is here, washing her laundry and her dishes in the waves below (using eco friendly soap of course). As the young man is pulled into her strange domestic tasks he learns that this world is infinitely interesting, and that only boring people let themselves get bored.
