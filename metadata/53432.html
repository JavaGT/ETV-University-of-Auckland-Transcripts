The most common videos usually feature slapstick physical comedy arising from incidents, accidents and mishaps. Other popular videos include humorous situations involving pets or children, while some are staged practical jokes.
Originally airing as a special on November 26, 1989, it debuted as a regular weekly series on January 14, 1990. Initially, it was hosted by Bob Saget for the 1989 special and the show's first eight seasons, then by John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actor/comedians such as D.L. Hughley and Richard Kind, ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in the Summer of 2001 with new host Tom Bergeron, who has since become the series' longest-serving host. It is currently in season 23 of the series, which began on October 7, 2012</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:42</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-04-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:00:00</td></tr></table>
