It is about the size of a couple of stacked silver dollars and weighs approximately 17-25 grams. It is usually surgically placed or implanted just under the skin in the chest area. The device sends a tiny electrical pulse down a thin coded wire, called a lead, into your heart. This stimulates the heart to beat. These impulses are very tiny and most people do not feel them. While the device helps your heart maintain its rhythm, it also stores information about your heart that can be retrieved by your doctor to program the device.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>49s</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Careers, Health, Learning Support, Physical Education, Science, Technology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-07-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:01:00</td></tr></table>
