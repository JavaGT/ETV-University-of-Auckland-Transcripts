Based on Paton's book of the same name, this vibrant series embarks on a highly visual journey of exploration to uncover and examine the marvels and mysteries of painting. The heart of the series is Justin's engaging commentary on a wide variety of artworks, appealing to novices, sceptics and experts alike.

Guiding us through the seemingly 'nothing' world of abstract art, Justin teaches us that paintings that look like nothing at all always have something to say.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Design, Media Studies, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ HEARTLAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
