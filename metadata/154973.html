Showing how extraordinarily close we came to self-destruction, the inside story of the Cuban Missile Crisis is a critical reminder of just how much power and responsibility lies with the President of the United States and other leaders with access to nuclear weapons. And how much personality counts when things spiral out of control. On the brink of a nuclear war, who would you want in the White House?

Bringing to life the three central figures in the crisis &ndash; President John F. Kennedy, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and Cuban leader Fidel Castro &ndash; the film explores the roles each played during these most dangerous of all times. Shot on location in Russia, Cuba and the U.S, it features revealing interviews with key witnesses from inside the Kremlin, the White House and Cuba, along with revelations from recently declassified Top Secret documents. After watching Nuclear Nightmare: Inside the Cuban Missile Crisis, you will never think about Nuclear War and our Commanders-in-Chief in quite the same way again.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:43:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-08-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
