Neighbourhood is a television series that explores and celebrates New Zealand's cultural diversity in a fresh and engaging way. This series aims to take the viewer on a personal and eclectic journey of New Zealand's cultural landscape through the eyes of the diverse ethnic minorities that live here. 
Every week the episode is based in a different neighbourhood and explores four strands that look at creativity, food, politics, and treasure from a cultural perspective unique to that neighbourhood. Breaking out of the traditional presenter role, and to reflect New Zealand's diversity, Neighbourhood is being curated by a different, well known, New Zealander each week who has a special tie with the area and their own unique cultural story to tell.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:00:00</td></tr></table>
