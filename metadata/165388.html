First, the sewers must carefully follow a pattern to make a babygrow from stretch cotton jersey - but who will get the gusset and poppers in the right place and who will end up going off-piste?

Next, the sewers must show they can handle slippery satin and chiffon by totally transforming an adult bridesmaid dress into a wearable garment for a boy or a girl. For the final challenge, real children replace the mannequins as the sewers strive to create perfectly fitted woollen capes, knowing the judges will scrutinise every cut and stitch before deciding who deserves to stay and who must bid farewell to the Sewing Bee.

About series:
Get your needle and thread ready, The Great British Sewing Bee is back! Hosted by comedian Joe Lycett [Live at the Apollo, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, 8 Out of 10 Cats], join costume designer (and pattern cutting expert) Esme Young from Central Saint Martins and Saville Row&rsquo;s finest Patrick Grant as they adjudicate the work of amateur dressmakers in a series of challenges. The iconic sewing bee embraces what it means to have a go and that it&rsquo;s never too late to pursue what you love. Some designs have heart, and were passed down through generations, while others show their maker&rsquo;s vivacious personalities, and some.. don&rsquo;t turn out quite as expected. It&rsquo;s the bake-off of the fashion world, and it&rsquo;s bigger and better than ever!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:07:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Design, Media Studies, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>LIVING</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-07-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
