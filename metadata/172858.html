While celebrating the ground-breaking work of female film directors, Half the Picture investigates the systemic discrimination that has, for decades, denied opportunities to far too many talented women in Hollywood.

Experts on gender inequality in Hollywood reveal the magnitude of employment discrimination, as women are shut out of an industry that systematically attempts to deny their expression and point of view.

Half the Picture consists of interviews with high profile women directors including Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle in Time, Selma), Lena Dunham (Girls) and Catherine Hardwicke (Lords of Dogtown, Twilight).

The women discuss their early working lives, how they balance demanding directing careers with family, and the challenges and joys along the way.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:31:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Drama, English, Media Studies, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-11-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
