In and around Luang Prabang, increased tourism is posing a real risk to the traditional textiles that have been sought after since the Tang dynasty.

A growing industry
Since opening its doors to international travellers in 1989, Laos has been steadily attracting visitors with its tribal regions and temple-studded hills. But in 2012 the country saw a significant spike, with the Ministry of Tourism reporting 3.3 million international visits, up 22% from 2011.

For a very long time, craftsmanship seemed to belong to another age, another world. People had been hand-weaving fabrics for generations, using ancient methods, sometimes like well-guarded secrets. Over time, those ancestral techniques gave them an international reputation in the world of luxury and Haute Couture.

Between tradition and modernity, this series relates five destinies - five exceptional craftspeople across the globe. All of them produce the rarest and finest textiles: cashmere in Mongolia, yak hair in Tibet, plant fibres in Japan, silk in Laos or cotton in India.

Each episode takes us to discover their country, their daily life and share the reality of their societies to meet those who weave bonds between ancestral techniques and contemporary design. Through their work, they build bridges between cultures and continents. A colourful and sensitive voyage that plunges us into breath-taking landscapes, offering a journey inside their world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:51:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Magazine, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Art, Business, Careers, Design, Ecology & Environment, Education & Teaching, Engineering, Geography, Health, History, Information Technology, Languages, Leadership, Learning Support, Literature, Media Studies, Philosophy, Photography, Political Studies, Religion & Theology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology, Teaching, Technology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-11-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:00</td></tr></table>
