At Porirua, fires are lit for the biggest hangi in many years. At Aotea Quay in Wellington, an emotional ceremony takes place as the soldiers disembark from the troop ship. At a small rural marae, a memorial is unveiled to a Maori Battalion solider who didn't come home.  The hangi is opened and the feasting begins. At Ngaruawahia, the train carrying the soliders arrives and the troops march to the marae. The long journey is over.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:10:27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Maori, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
