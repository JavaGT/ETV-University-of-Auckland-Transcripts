It's 1832 in West Yorkshire, England -- the cradle of the evolving Industrial Revolution -- where landowner Anne Lister is determined to save her faded ancestral home, Shibden Hall, even if it means bucking society's expectations. In addition to reopening the coal mines, a part of Lister's plan to help her family is to marry well. But the charismatic, single-minded Lister -- who dresses head-to-toe in black and charms her way into high society -- has no intention of marrying a man. &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot; examines Lister's relationships with her family, servants, tenants and industrial rivals, and would-be wife. The real-life Anne Lister's story was recorded in her diaries, and the most intimate details of her life are revealed for the series.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Anthropology, Art, Business, Design, Drama, History, Leadership, Literature, Media Studies, Philosophy, Political Studies, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-06-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
