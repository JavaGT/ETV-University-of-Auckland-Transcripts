About series:
In the same vein as shows like The Undateables and Love on the Spectrum, Down For Love looks to celebrate disability and neurodiversity within the primetime dating show format. Created and produced by Attitude Pictures, the series is an original format that grew organically from conversations around Down Syndrome and dating. &ldquo;We were wanting to do something in the area of love and relationships, because there are significant barriers for people living with disabilities,&rdquo; series producer Robyn Paterson explains. &ldquo;And I really wanted to bring more of a documentary lens to it, so that it could go beyond just entertainment.&rdquo; 

Of all the production companies to bring depth to the dating show genre, Attitude is particularly well-placed to handle the sensitivities of a show like Down For Love. Since its inception in 2005, Attitude has had a focus on producing content in the mental health and disability space in Aotearoa. Paterson says founder Robyn Scott-Vincent had the goal &ldquo;to make a difference to people&rsquo;s understanding of disability&rdquo; after her own son, who lives with a disability, was excluded from attending their local school. &ldquo;She felt like if people understood more about living with disability, that perhaps that would start to change people&rsquo;s perceptions.&rdquo;

That was nearly two decades ago, and Attitude has since become a Sunday morning stalwart on TVNZ, focused on telling the stories of people from across the country including activist Dr Huhana Hickey and model and influencer Sophia Malthus. Behind the scenes, the company also helps to mentor and grow the careers of people who live with disabilities, fostering diversity both on and off the camera. &ldquo;People come and go but a lot of us come back,&rdquo; says Paterson. &ldquo;I think that is because the content has a lot of heart and meaning, it&rsquo;s got purpose.&rdquo;

It is that commitment to the cause that led to the New Zealand Down Syndrome Association (NZDSA) getting onboard with Down For Love, collaborating from the early production stages all the way through to providing feedback on edited cuts of the episodes. &ldquo;We were well aware that they were very much a disability-led production company,&rdquo; explains NZDSA national executive officer Zandra Vaccarino. &ldquo;They have a mana-enhancing lens where they really want people to tell their own stories and to own the narrative, so that made me feel a lot more comfortable.&rdquo;

For Vaccarino, Down For Love provided a chance to showcase not just the diversity within the Down Syndrome community, but celebrate a part of their lives that is often misunderstood or ignored &ndash; romantic relationships. &ldquo;People make assumptions that people with Down Syndrome may not want a relationship, or cannot have a relationship,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;I knew that people with Down Syndrome would be keen to have their stories told and to raise awareness that, just like everyone else, they also want to have meaningful relationships.&rdquo;

By all accounts, Down For Love appears to have a slightly better success rate than the likes of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, which Paterson credits to Attitude&rsquo;s researcher and match-maker Justin Scott. &ldquo;We did a lot of work in all our pre-interviews to try and figure out what they wanted in a partner, what they wanted in life, what they wanted to do on a date,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;We would match them with someone with similar lifestyles and interests. Then, at the very least, if there wasn&rsquo;t a romantic connection they would get a really solid friendship.&rdquo;

For everyone involved in the production, their duty of care was extended to everything from ensuring the scheduling was comfortable for all the participants, to having a disability-specific counsellor available throughout. Giving participants agency over their own stories was also key. &ldquo;We really wanted people to stay in the driver&rsquo;s seat of their own stories,&rdquo; says Paterson. &ldquo;Especially with intellectual disabilities, because people aren&rsquo;t often afforded the right to tell their own stories.&rdquo; It was also important to represent a diverse range of people within the Down Syndrome community, as well as their wider networks of family and friends. 
 
Zaccarino hopes that Down For Love promotes the idea that people living with Down Syndrome have a right to be included in the &ldquo;universal experience&rdquo; that is finding love. &ldquo;Everyone in society has the right to a relationship,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I think it is a platform to start having valuable conversations around relationships and inclusion.&rdquo; Paterson agrees. &ldquo;I hope people get a better understanding from it and afford people living with disabilities the respect that they deserve, especially in terms of having the same wants and needs as everybody else.&rdquo;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:01:11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment, Interview, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Health, Media Studies, New Zealand, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
