Protests erupt in Israel amid Netanyahu&rsquo;s government push for broad judicial reform. Plus, Greece&rsquo;s wiretapping scandal on its journalists is not getting enough media attention.

The hard-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu is facing off against Israeli protesters triggered by sweeping changes to judicial powers in the country. Adding to the cacophony is news coverage from outlets that range from the Fox-style Channel 14, with its conspiracy theories and pro-government talking points, to the opportunistic Channel 13, which is trying to recast itself as being supportive of the protests.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Leadership, Media Studies, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-04-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
