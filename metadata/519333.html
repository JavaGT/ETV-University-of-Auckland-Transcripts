The 30,000 square metre facility is the third site to open under NZ Post's $200 million investment in parcel processing infrastructure, with the Wellington Super Depot and the Southern Operations Centre upgrade both opening in 2022.  

Marie Watson, NZ Post's general manager of processing and automation, said the eventual integration with international products under one roof will set it apart from anything seen before in New Zealand.
