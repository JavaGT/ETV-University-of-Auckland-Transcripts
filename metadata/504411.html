After four months and interviews with 250 people, public service troubleshooter Dame Margaret Bazley on Thursday morning released her 89-page report, which was triggered by sexual misconduct involving summer interns around December 2015.

While most people interviewed felt it was a &quot;great place to work&quot; others told Bazley the law firm had a work-hard, play-hard culture &quot;that involved excessive drinking and in some instances crude, drunken, and sexually inappropriate behaviour&quot;.
