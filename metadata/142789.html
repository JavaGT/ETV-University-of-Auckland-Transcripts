Jeff meets the first four groups and assigns their challenge. 

About the Series:
Host Jeff Hunkin has searched New Zealand for the next generation of amateur A Capella singing groups, and only eight will go through to perform in front of a live audience.

Mentoring the groups are Igelese Ete, Ravil Atlas and Clare Martin, while judges Matt Gifford, Lizzie Marvelly and NZCF Chair John Rosser will use their industry experience and expertise to find the best of the best.

From Christchurch to the Bay of Plenty to Auckland, the groups come from all walks of life &ndash; but which one will rise to the challenge?
