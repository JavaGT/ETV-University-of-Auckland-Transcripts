Jesse's newest recruits, Robert (Casey Affleck) and Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell), grow increasingly jealous of the outlaw. When they sense an opportunity to kill Jesse, they gun him down, but their actions backfire when Jesse's fame is elevated to near mythical status.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:42:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Duke</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-07-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
