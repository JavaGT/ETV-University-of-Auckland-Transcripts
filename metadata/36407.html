With many of the male staff serving in the war, Carson finds himself under pressure to make sure that duties are carried out to his exacting standard. He ends up finding himself forced to accept female staff serving in the dining room. Lord Grantham needs to hire a new valet and ends up employing Lang, who has just returned from the war. William is happy after he receives an important letter. Mrs Patmore finds out some devastating news about her soldier nephew. Thomas returns from the war (after intentionally getting himself wounded and therefore discharged from active duty) and begins work alongside Lady Sybil in the local hospital. After a patient is brought in suffering with gas blindness, Thomas finds himself becoming attracted to the young Lieutenant. Moseley takes an interest in Anna. Matthew learns of his temporary transfer back to England for a recruitment drive in the north while fighting in the trenches. Carson advises Mary that if she still loves Matthew she needs to tell him before it is too late. Meanwhile, Lavinia (Matthew's new fianc&eacute;e who is staying with Mrs Crawley) is reunited with an unwelcome face from her past.

Set in an Edwardian country house in 1912, Downton Abbey portrays the lives of the Crawley family and the servants who work for them. In the drawing rooms, library, and beautiful bedrooms, with their tall windows looking across the park, lives the family, but below stairs are other residents, the servants, as fiercely possessive of their ranks as anyone above.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:13:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, History, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-10-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:28:00</td></tr></table>
