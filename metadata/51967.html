Special Agent Debra Parker (Annie Parisse), an expert on alternative religions, joins the case, replacing Agent Mason, as the hunt for Joe's son intensifies. Joe's prison guard prot&eacute;g&eacute; Jordy (Steve Monroe) makes his first kill, slaughtering three college girls in their sorority house. Claire tries to discover Joey's whereabouts from Joe, but the interview only serves to reveal her prior relationship with Hardy to everyone. Joey's nanny-turned-kidnapper Emma Hill, having convinced him that he's on an adventure, takes him to an isolated house, along with Sarah Fuller's &quot;gay&quot; neighbors Paul Torres (Adan Canto) and Jacob Wells (Nico Tortorella). Tensions begin to rise between the three as Paul, having pretended to be Jacob's lover for years, is now jealous of the intimate relationship between Jacob and Emma. Hardy is attacked by a Poe masked man while investigating Emma's old residence. Jordy attacks Claire in her home, but Hardy wounds him and he is arrested. Parker delivers a book of Poe's works to Joe in prison, which results in a short but noticeable unspoken communication between the two of them. The next day, the man in the Poe mask lights a seemingly random civilian on fire in a crowd.
