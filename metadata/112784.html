It is time to see if personalised dieting will work in normal life. The volunteers have been given one of three diets to follow - based on their genes, their hormones and their psychology. But now they are back at home, trying to stick to their personalised diets with all the stresses and temptations of real life.

Dr Chris van Tulleken and Professor Tanya Byron discover how our genetic makeup can make temptation difficult to resist, how understanding the brain reveals what makes us comfort eat and what science can tell us about why we make disastrous food choices.

About the series:
Could a better understanding of individual physiology and genetics be the key to successfully losing weight?

In a ground-breaking experiment, this series brings together the world&rsquo;s foremost experts in genetics, biochemistry, neuroscience, nutrition science and applied behavioural medicine to test the latest weight loss theory. The central tenet of this theory suggests the key to sustained weight loss could be in knowing which physiological group, or diet tribe, you belong to. If proved correct, it could have the potential to transform our approach to dieting.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:07:46</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Health, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-08-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
