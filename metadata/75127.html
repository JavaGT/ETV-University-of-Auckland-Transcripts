Join Ross Kemp as he travels to the Democratic Republic of Congo to take an unapologetically unflinching look at the decade-long war between the Congolese and Hutu militia. 

Kemp travels around the world talking to people involved in illicit trades, locals who have been affected by violence and hardship, and the authorities who are attempting to combat the problems. In each episode he attempts to establish contacts within the groups in order to get close to the ringleaders.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:32</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Geography, Law, Political Studies, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
