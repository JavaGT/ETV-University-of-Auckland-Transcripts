They have very different experiences of cooking - Andrew cooks mostly for his mum and his grandad and is hoping to get a bit more experimental today, whereas Stephen loves to throw dinner parties for friends and is hoping to pick up some dishes today that he can impress his guests with. Rylan Clark-Neal is making sure things stay on track in the kitchen, and chefs Romy Gill and Ellis Barrie are pulling out all the stops to create some amazing dishes.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:36</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, Food Science, Health, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-08-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
