ABOUT GANG RELATED
Every villain has a noble cause, and every hero has a dark side.

Detective RYAN LOPEZ (Ramon Rodriguez, Battle Los Angeles, The Wire) is a rising star in Los Angeles&rsquo; elite Gang Task Force. What the world doesn't know is that long before Ryan became a cop, he pledged allegiance to a different band of brothers &ndash; a powerful Latino gang called Los Angelicos.

When Ryan&rsquo;s best friend and police partner is senselessly killed by a notorious gang member, Ryan teams up with longtime Task Force member CASSIUS GREEN (RZA, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Californication), who has been at the forefront of the city&rsquo;s war on organized crime. 

In this war between law enforcement and gangs, the series explores how only people who really know the streets can win the battle on the streets.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Political Studies, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:40:00</td></tr></table>
