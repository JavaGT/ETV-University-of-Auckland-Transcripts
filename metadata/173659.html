Hit by an artillery shell in World War I, Joe has suffered injuries that have all but erased his humanity: he's lost his sight, speech, hearing and sense of smell. But he still has the ability to think and remember, which, in the end, may be more a curse than a blessing. Trapped in his body, Joe realizes there's only one way out of his misery: death. Can he get a sympathetic nurse to help him?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:51:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, History, Literature, Media Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-11-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:00:00</td></tr></table>
