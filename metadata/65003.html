But can you tell us how to get the egg out again?

Items you need for this experiment:
Milk bottle x 1
Hard boiled eggs (the smaller the better)
Strips of paper
Lighter
Jam jars of different sizes
Balloons
Water
 
Instructions:
1. Boil an egg for 15 minutes -- to make sure it is completely hardboiled.
2. Peel the shell of the egg.
3. Tear the paper into strips.
4. Light a couple of strips of paper and place them into the milk bottle.
5. Quickly place the hardboiled egg on top of the neck of the bottle.
6. The flame inside the bottle creates a partial vacuum that will suck the egg inside!
You can do this experiment with water balloons and jam jars too.
