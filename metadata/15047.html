He Koha Ma Bob Marley
is a documentary that follows Ruia as he travels to Jamaica, to give back to Marley's family some of the music the immortal Jamaican helped inspire and shape. 
 When reggae first exploded on the international scene, it coincided with the early stages of cultural revival among Maori, of reo and tikanga - language and cultural practices. The great Bob Marley's lyrics were not just from another brown man. They also spoke of the oppression of indigenous people, and articulated what many Maori were feeling as they discovered more about the injustices their people had suffered during the colonisation of Aotearoa. Today, over thirty years later, Maori love of reggae continues, from Jamaica, the birth-place of reggae, to other international reggae artists, and just as significantly, many homegrown acts as well, from Herbs to 12 Tribes, Katchafire, Kora and Aperahama himself. 
 Ruia Aperehama is a Maori reggae musician who sings in te reo, and he has released two albums of Bob Marley songs in Maori. His hope has always been to one day return the albums as a koha to the Marley family, in Jamaica. This documentary follows the New Zealander as he visits Nine Mile, Bob Marley's birth and resting place.  He goes to Trenchtown, the Kingston slum of Marley's songs, and to Hope Road to see the original Tuff Gong recording studio where the legend began.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
