The search for Australia's best parenting style continues. 

About series:
Do you smack your child? Would your child go off with a stranger? How do you deal with discipline? Do you let your child run free? These are the types of confronting questions that will be asked in Nine's groundbreaking new series, Parental Guidance.

This show will have every Australian parent comparing and asking whether their methods are right, and what sort of parent they are.

In search of Australia's best parenting style, opinionated parents with diverse parenting techniques will take turns assessing each other's style through a series of the toughest challenges ever attempted. They will confront methods that divide opinion, cause spirited debate and will even be uncomfortable for some.

From helicopter parents to tiger parents, free-range and routine parents to extreme authoritarians, they will all show how they raise their families while trying to influence everyone else that their parenting style is best.

Parental Guidance will take us behind the closed family doors of parenthood, and how we ourselves were parented, to find out how to do it right, right now?
