In 1947, unable to find a publisher to print his thesis - much of it devised during his stay on Fatu Hiva, an island in the Marquesas - he hatches a daring plan to cross the Pacific on a balsa wood raft, just like the ancient Incas before him. Unshakeable in his determination, Heyerdahl simply refuses to give up - despite the fact that the scientific community openly mocks him, he can't find funding for the voyage, his first recruit for the raft's crew is a stocky refrigerator salesman, and he himself can't swim.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:49:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie, Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Geography, History, Pacifica</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
