About series:
Adapted by Heidi Thomas from the best-selling memoirs of Jennifer Worth, this drama series is a moving, funny, colorful look at midwifery and family in 1950s East End London. It follows newly qualified midwife Jenny, who joins an eccentric, lovable community of nuns who are nurses at Nonnatus House. Jenny is surprised to find herself at a convent -- she thought she was being sent to a small private hospital -- and is initially daunted by her surroundings, most notably the formidable Sister Evangelina and the unconventional Sister Monica Joan. But Jenny gradually begins to find her way and develops incredible friendships among the nurses, as they are drawn into the lives and homes of the women and families they treat.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:12:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Health, History, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-05-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
