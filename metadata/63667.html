A most alternative history of Britain begins in the Georgian era. Lucy Inglis examines the murky world of women bare-knuckle boxing in 18th century London.

'Fight Club: A History of Violence' tells the stories of how people have used organised fighting throughout the ages. It s the oldest form of entertainment. Throughout the centuries close physical combat has been used to entertain the public; to make fortunes for gamblers; to escape the bonds of slavery; to aid diplomatic relations; to settle scores and finish vendettas; to protect and maintain personal honour. The series looks at the realities of the realities of these ruthless one-on-one contests and how they affected the mind and the body. It puts them into social and historical context by painting a vivid picture of the time in which they took place.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, History, Physical Education, Psychology, Sociology, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-08-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:30:00</td></tr></table>
