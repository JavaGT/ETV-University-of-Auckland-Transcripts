Even with three heavy rescue trucks, Jamie's crew doesn't have enough equipment to do the job right. Adam is angry about the lack of equipment and the poor condition of his truck. Last year, Jamie ordered a state of the art heavy rescue truck called a Rotator. But the busy winter season is here and the custom-built wrecker still hasn't been delivered. Just days before Christmas, Jamie heads to the factory in Tennessee to bring it home himself with his new recruit, Hugo. While they are gone, Adam has his hands full with the B team when a semi filled with expensive wine goes off a cliff.
