Nau mai haere mai ki te wāhanga tuaono ō te pakipūmeka mō te 'Māori Economy'. Ko tēnei wāhanga e kōrero mō te ā mua o te Taiōhanga Māori.

Most Māori businesses have long-term plans. Not 10 or 20-year horizons, but multiple generations.

Nelson based Wakatū Incorporation, one of the country&rsquo;s leading food and beverage exporters, has embedded Te Pae Tawhiti into the business. Te Pae Tawhiti, a rangatahi (youth) innovated 500-year plan that presides over everything Wakātu does as a business. Te Pae Tawhiti ingrains a collective responsibility within the business to build value over generations.

For Wakatū, &lsquo;value&rsquo; means taking care of social, cultural and environmental needs as well as financial returns. It measures itself on positive outcomes for whānau, the taiao (environment) and hapori (communities).

&ldquo;For me this whole shift about wellbeing, caring for our land is the real New Zealand now, and if we don&rsquo;t start thinking about these things and if we don&rsquo;t seriously think about this and make the radical changes it&rsquo;s ours to lose. We&rsquo;re only 5 million people, as a country if we can&rsquo;t make a radical change and lead the world who can?&rdquo; says Robotics Plus Founder/CEO, Steve Saunders.

Ka nui te mihi ki a koutou katoa mō te matakitaki i te wāhanga whakamutunga o tēnei pakipūmeka mō te Taiōhanga Māori. Ko mātou tūmanako kua ako koutou mō ngā hītori me ngā tīkanga me ngā uaratanga o ngā pakihi Māori.
