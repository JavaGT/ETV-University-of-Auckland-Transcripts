In the days of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin maintained strong ties with African nations. But the collapse of the USSR in the 1990&rsquo;s caused Russia to retreat inward. But now, it appears ready to once again to establish close relationships on the continent.

In recent months, Russia has built military partnerships with Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR). The Kremlin has also shipped arms to Cameroon to aid in the fight against Boko Haram. It also has plans to build a nuclear power plant in Sudan.

Following an appearance in July at the 10th BRICS Summit (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted he was interested in organising the first ever Russia-Africa Summit.

For countries on the continent the attention from Moscow is tempting because it allows them to pit the Kremlin against China, India, Turkey and The West. And according to Russia&rsquo;s Economy Minister, Mazim Oreshkin, a partnership with Russia can help African countries achieve sustainable growth in the wake of global trade wars and protectionism.

So how will this situation develop? And what does Russia really want? We ask a panel of experts.
