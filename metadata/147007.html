About series:
here are few situations in life that guarantee such a potent mix of drama, warmth and humour; and unlike traditional observational documentaries, The Secret Life of the Family has Hugh Dennis as a narrator with a unique point of view, illuminating family life in all its diversity, humanity and hilarity. Each episode reveals that we&rsquo;ve all got far more in common than we might think, as we watch the families attempting to motivate teens, tackle DIY, go on car journeys and entertain at home.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-10-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
