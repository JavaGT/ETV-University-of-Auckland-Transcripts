When Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. arrives New York in 1893, the intersection of Broadway and 42nd is nobody&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;the crossroads of the world.&rdquo;  But by 1913, &ldquo;The Ziegfeld Follies really were an amalgamation of everything that was happening in America, in New York, at that time,&rdquo; says writer Philip Furia.  &ldquo;Flo Ziegfeld was like the Broadway equivalent of the melting pot itself.&rdquo;  Ziegfeld&rsquo;s story introduces many of the era&rsquo;s key figures:  Irving Berlin, a Russian immigrant who becomes the voice of assimilated America; entertainers, like Jewish comedienne Fanny Brice and African American Bert Williams, who become America&rsquo;s first &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; artists; and the brash Irish-American George M. Cohan, whose song-and-dance routines embody the energy of Broadway.  This is also the story of the onset of a world war, and the Red Summer of 1919, when labor unrest sweeps the nation &ndash; and Broadway.  Episode One culminates in Ziegfeld&rsquo;s 1927 production of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II&rsquo;s far-sighted masterpiece, Show Boat.  &ldquo;The history of the American musical theater is divided quite simply into two eras: everything before Show Boat, and everything after Show Boat,&rdquo; says writer Miles Kreuger.

The episode features interviews with Irving Berlin&rsquo;s daughter Mary Ellen Barrett, Ziegfeld Follies girls Doris Eaton and Dana O&rsquo;Connell, New Yorker critic Brendan Gill, theater artist Al Hirschfeld, composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim, and Ziegfeld daughter Patricia Z. Stephenson.  Highlights include newly-restored color footage of The Ziegfeld Follies and footage of Fanny Brice singing &ldquo;My Man.&rdquo;
