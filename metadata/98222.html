About House of Lies
Charming, fast talking Marty Kaan and his crack team of management consultants know how to play the corporate game better than anyone, by using every dirty trick in the book to woo powerful CEOs and close huge deals.
In the board rooms, bar rooms, and bedrooms of the power elite, corruption is business as usual and everyone's out for themselves first.
Nothing is sacred in this scathing, irreverent satire of corporate America today.
