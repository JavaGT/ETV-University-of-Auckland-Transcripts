The documentary covers the 51-day Ross Sea voyage of New Zealand's deepwater research vessel Tangaroa in February and March 2008. The voyage was New Zealand's contribution to a major International Polar Year project to complete a census of Antarctic marine life around the continent. During the voyage, more than 31,000 specimens were collected. Fish experts on board recorded 88 fish species, of which eight are new to science, and many of which have special adaptations to deal with the extreme polar and deep-sea environments they live in. Samples included giant-sized animals; starfish as big as a serving dish, large sea-spiders, jellyfish with tentacles up to four metres long, and hydroids (relatives of corals) three to four times larger than specimens previously seen in the Ross Sea. A whole new family of deep sea octopuses was also discovered.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
