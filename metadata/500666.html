The new Serpentine Dance was originated by American dancer Lo&iuml;e Fuller, who have never danced professionally. She discovered, by accident, the effects of stage light cast from different angles on the gauze fabric of a costume she had assembled for her performance in the play Quack M.D., and developed the new form in response to the audience&rsquo;s enthusiastic reaction. During the dance, she held her skirt with the hands and waved it around revealing her from the inside.

The Serpentine Dance was a very frequent subject of early motion pictures. There are two particularly well-known versions. 1) Annabelle Serpentine Dance of 1894, is a performance by Broadway dancer Annabelle Whitford from Edison Studios. 2) The Lumi&egrave;re brothers film made in 1896 is a performance by Lo&iuml;e Fuller.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>49s</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-09-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:41:09</td></tr></table>
