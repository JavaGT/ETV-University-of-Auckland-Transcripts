About series:
Pax Assadi is your typical 12-year-old from the early 2000s - obsessed with hip hop, girls, and Eddie Murphy. His parents came to New Zealand in the late '80s as refugees and want him to get good grades, but all Pax wants to do is fit in. However, a major international incident makes that very difficult.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, History, Law, Media Studies, New Zealand, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-02-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:40:00</td></tr></table>
