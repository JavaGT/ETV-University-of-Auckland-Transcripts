But very little is known about the animal communities that live on the seabed or how crucial these communities are to the health of the marine environment and their role in sustaining our fish resources. As Ministry of Fisheries Principal Scientist Dr. Mary Livingston explains, the government's Ocean Survey 20/20 Chatham/Challenger research project is focused on discovering this information. The project aims to map habitats and marine biodiversity of the seabed down to water depths of 1200m in two areas - the Chatham Rise east of New Zealand and the Challenger Plateau to the west.
