In Gaetano Donizetti&rsquo;s two-act opera, Lucrezia Borgia (libretto by Felice Romani, based on Victor Hugo&rsquo;s play of the same name), a notorious femme fatale renowned for her ruthless pursuit of power reveals poignant vulnerability when she comes face to face with her long-lost son, Gennaro. 

&ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia&rdquo; is perhaps one of Donizetti&rsquo;s most dramatic operas with arguably some of the most unlikeable characters in the artform. However, it ranks as one of his most inventive and one of his most compelling.

The music which brings audiences a step closer to early Verdi, sees Donizetti in experimental mode with some of the traditional forms. Those who are familiar with the double arias present throughout his oeuvre may find themselves surprised when he eschews them altogether. The same goes for other scenes in which Donizetti seems to be testing the line between traditional opera language and a potential for a newer and more direct one.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:23:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Entertainment, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Dance, Design, History, Italian, Languages, Media Studies, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-08-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:00:00</td></tr></table>
