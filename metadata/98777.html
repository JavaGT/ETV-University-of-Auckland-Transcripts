About Big, Bigger, Biggest:
Big, Bigger, Biggest reveals the inventions that enabled structures such as Submarines, Aircraft, Cruise Ships, Dams, Tunnels, Oil Rigs, Observation Wheels, Telescopes, Space Stations and Domes to grow in size and scale.

Venture on board the USS Pennsylvania &mdash; the US Navy's biggest Submarine &mdash; to explore the technology that allows the 155-crew vessel to dive deep underwater, sail for 20 years without refueling and remain submerged for up to six months without resurfacing.

Learn about the technological leaps that have allowed the world's biggest Cruise Ship &mdash; the Independence of the Seas &mdash; to be developed. The ship cost 800 million dollar to build, carries passengers in unrivaled luxury and is manned by a crew of 1,360 who occupy a vast behind-the-scenes world of control rooms, kitchens and engine spaces. It is a true ocean Goliath.

Follow the team who operate the world's biggest Cargo Aircraft &mdash; the Antonov 124 &mdash; as they transport a brand new subway train from Germany to India. The Antonov stands as tall as a 7-story building and has a cavernous cargo bay capable of holding 50 family-sized cars. The series reveals the critical innovations that allow the aircraft to carry everything from battle tanks to other aircraft to every corner of the world.

Rolling back the clock and winding down the scale, each episode reveals the six inventions that allowed these colossal structures to gradually grow to mammoth proportions, and the six historic structures that led to these modern-day marvels.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:39</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Ecology & Environment, Economics, Engineering, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-01-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:00:00</td></tr></table>
