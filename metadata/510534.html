Earlier this month, as the Biden administration announced the end of the COVID-19 national emergency, the United States also saw the end of a controversial Trump-era public health regulation, known as Title 42. It allowed the US government to expel hundreds of thousands of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border to seek asylum, on the grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Refugee and migrant rights advocates were hopeful that the expiration of Title 42 would clear the way for a more humane policy. But then the Biden administration swiftly applied tough new immigration rules to discourage people from entering the US.

Human rights groups have called the measures an outright &ldquo;asylum ban&rdquo;, while some Democratic Party representatives are comparing them to Trump-era policies.

In this episode of The Stream, we&rsquo;ll examine what lies ahead for vulnerable people at the US-Mexico border.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-05-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
