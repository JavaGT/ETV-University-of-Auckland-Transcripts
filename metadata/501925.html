They are joined in the Green Pepper Kitchen by our queen of spice, chef Romy Gill, and bringing a modern British and Irish twist to the Red Tomato Kitchen, is chef Anna Haugh. Simon and Carolyn are the chief cooks in both their households and have often ended up cooking together socially, so they know each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses well.
