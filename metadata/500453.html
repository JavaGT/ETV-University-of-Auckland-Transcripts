Following or Leading? Modern Learning Environments, Digital Technologies and &ldquo;The Future&rdquo; of Education &ndash; is this it?
When people talk about education future, technology and modern learning environments are writ large. How important are these? Is this what &ldquo;future-focused&rdquo; education is all about? Should we be investing millions of dollars in what might turn out to be just a fad? This session won&rsquo;t try to provide answers to these questions: rather it will be designed to provoke debate. The session will be led by Jane Gilbert, and education theorist and Danielle Myburgh, a practicing teacher who lives and breathes modern learning environments and digital technologies. They will pose questions, and play a &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s&rdquo; advocate&rdquo; role in the discussion. Come to this session if you want to engage in deep discussion of these ideas and walk away, not with &ldquo;answers&rdquo;, but more questions.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:51:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-08-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:26:18</td></tr></table>
