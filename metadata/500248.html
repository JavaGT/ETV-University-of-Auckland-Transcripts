Visiting members of the Fijian and Nigerian Empire Games teams also attend and have fun trying out the tractors. A new type of fertilizer spreader operating on the back of a truck was on show. It has a nozzle that can be trained in any direction. 02.30 National Archery Championships: Archers from all over New Zealand compete in a field shoot in bush near Wellington and target shooting at Athletic Park. The best dressed team award goes to Randwick Ladies for their Robin Hood uniform. 04.20 NZR Locomotive Building: Dunedin's Railway Workshops build the second heaviest engines used in New Zealand, the one hundred-and-nine-ton JA class, especially designed for the South Island main lines. The locomotives are completely assembled at the Hillside plant and 95 per cent of the finished parts are made here. Steel for casting many of the parts is also made at Hillside. An eight hundredweight trapling rod, white-hot from the furnace, is beaten into shape by a two ton steam hammer. A surface grinder finishes the parts off to within thousands of an inch, the standard of accuracy demanded throughout. The final assembly is carried out meticulously, the engine get their finished paint jobs and their first head of steam.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Engineering, History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
