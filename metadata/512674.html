For nearly 30 years, Arts on Tour has been connecting some of New Zealand&rsquo;s biggest entertainers with rural audiences, providing the cultural lifeline of live performance to small communities across the motu. But funding cuts are now threatening to halt these shows that have, for so long, contributed to the social wellbeing of towns from Kaitaia to Invercargill. Sunday&rsquo;s Mark Crysell ventures to Southland to hear from locals who reckons this is yet another example of how people in regional Aotearoa are being left high and dry.
