About series:
Dee Hart Dyke, one of Britain's best amateur gardeners, is heading on a road trip to visit some of the country&rsquo;s most beautiful open gardens. Dee first started gardening at the age of eight after her mother gave her a packet of seeds, and she now hopes to pass on the tradition to her daughter Comedian Miranda Hart, and has made it her mission to make a gardener out of her daughter by the end of summer.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Social Studies, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>LIVING</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-08-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
