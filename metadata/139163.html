About the Series:
Follow a group of young people with a range of learning disabilities as they're trained in the art of hospitality.

People with a learning disability are more excluded from the workplace than any other group of disabled people. Foxes Academy offers a way forward, enabling young people to fulfill their potential despite their disabilities. This series follows them, experiencing the world through their eyes, as they leave home, live together, and prepare for the workplace and adult lives, in a world full of challenges.

There is no-where like Foxes. And this series gets to the heart of life here, documenting the extraordinary transformation as young people are given a chance to thrive.

Production company, Lambent, has a track record in documenting intimate personal stories. For this story to unfold they needed time, as transformation for students isn&rsquo;t always a swift process. Each learner has a range of challenges they need to overcome and it takes time and dedication to enable them to reach their potential.
So Lambent spent a year at Foxes Hotel and Academy. From the very first day of the new term, when new students arrived and their parents left them behind, to the final day of term, when students applied for jobs, planned their futures and graduated.

We hope that this series changes minds as well as touches hearts; that everyone who watches it thinks about learning disability differently. The class of 2015 are a remarkable bunch, and it was a privilege to tell their stories.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Learning Support, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2016-12-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:40:00</td></tr></table>
