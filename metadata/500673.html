The film remains most famous for Chaney's ghastly, self-devised make-up, which was kept a studio secret until the film's premiere. The film was released on November 25, 1925.

The picture also features Mary Philbin, Norman Kerry, Arthur Edmund Carewe, Gibson Gowland, John St. Polis and Snitz Edwards. The last surviving cast member was Carla Laemmle (1909&ndash;2014), niece of producer Carl Laemmle, who played a small role as a &quot;prima ballerina&quot; in the film when she was about 15.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:46:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-09-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:55:49</td></tr></table>
