He believed that is was the elixir of life yet should be taken in moderation. Timothy Leary had a similar journalistic fascination with the drug and wanted to explore Grant's affection for it. This film takes place in Grant's trailer. Leary invites himself along during a break in filming and he and Grant inadvertently consume a heroic dose.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:21:11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, History, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-09-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
