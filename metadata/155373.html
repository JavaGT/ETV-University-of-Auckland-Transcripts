When one police droid is stolen and given new programming, he acquires the ability to feel and think for himself. While the robot, dubbed &quot;Chappie (Sharlto Copley),&quot; puzzles out human behavior, the authorities begin to see him as a danger to mankind and order; they will stop at nothing to ensure that Chappie is the last of his kind.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:23:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-08-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:45:00</td></tr></table>
