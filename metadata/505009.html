A foreigner, Doc is detained when World War II starts, but from his prison cell he encourages P.K. to learn boxing. As he travels to different bouts, the adult P.K. (Stephen Dorff) forges relationships that anger the state's apartheid government -- but his reunion with his onetime schoolyard nemesis (Daniel Craig) may offer his biggest challenge yet.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:14:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-10-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
