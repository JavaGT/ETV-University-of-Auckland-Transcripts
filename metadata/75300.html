'Marion's Thailand' - Travel back to Thailand with Marion Grasby to visit the small village of Nakhon Chum, her mother's hometown. Noi taught Marion how to cook traditional Thai food using just a wok and a flame and in this beautifully shot series Marion reconnects with her maternal Thai family. Along the way she de-mystifies exotic Thai ingredients, shows us some of the more unique traditions surrounding Thai food and cooks an array of delicious, often unusual, Thai dishes.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Asian Studies, Food Science, Geography, Religion & Theology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOOD TV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:00:00</td></tr></table>
