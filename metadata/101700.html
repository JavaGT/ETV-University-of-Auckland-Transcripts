NEW ORLEANS is a drama about the local field office that investigates criminal cases affecting military personnel in the Big Easy, a city known for its music, entertainment and decadence. Leading the team is Special Agent Dwayne Pride (Golden Globe Award winner Scott Bakula), aka &ldquo;King,&rdquo; a native of NOLA who is driven by his need to do what is right. Working with Pride is Special Agent Christopher LaSalle (Lucas Black), who plays hard but works harder; and Special Agent Meredith &ldquo;Merri&rdquo; Brody (Zoe McLellan), a charismatic and tough interrogator who transferred from the Great Lakes office in search of a fresh start. Supporting them is coroner Dr. Loretta Wade (CCH Pounder), who is as eccentric as she is smart. This colorful city that harbors a dark side is a magnet for service personnel on leave, and when overindulgence is followed by trouble, Pride&rsquo;s team is at its best. Gary Glasberg (&ldquo;NCIS&rdquo;) and Mark Harmon (&ldquo;NCIS&rdquo;) are the executive producers for CBS Television Studios.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:45:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Information Technology, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-04-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
