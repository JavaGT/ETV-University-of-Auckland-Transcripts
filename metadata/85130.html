The research was carried out by Robert Schadewinkel as part of a long-term study of a geographically-isolated South Island robin population in the Dunedin area. A total of 19 individually colour-banded robins were monitored in the Silver Peaks before and after 1080 was dropped, to see whether or not any birds were killed. A second study population of 15 marked robins in nearby Silverstream - where no 1080 was dropped - was also monitored over the same period for comparative purposes. Breeding success was also monitored at both sites.
