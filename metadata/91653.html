Dangerous Dogs takes a graphic look at the dramatic rise of dog attacks in the UK.

During the making of the series, three people in the UK were killed by dogs and over 6,000 people were hospitalised after dog attacks in 2013. Every serious dog attack sparks an outcry and a string of devil dog headlines. This series looks beyond the headlines and
