About series:
Set in 17th-century Virginia, USA, this drama series follows the lives of the first settlers in the English colony of Jamestown. Alice, Verity and Jocelyn arrive ready to marry three men in the colony, who have paid for the women's transition to the New World. But upon their arrival, they quickly recognise the power struggles within the nascent community, which reach all the way up to the new governor and his staff. The women soon realise that they will need to rely on each other if they hope to survive the various challenges their new home presents to them.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:15:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-06-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
