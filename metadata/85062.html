Season 2 brings in Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker) as the newest character.  Jackie is a third-term Congresswoman from California and war veteran.  With the help of departing incumbent Frank Underwood, she becomes the House Majority Whip. 

House of Cards is a highly acclaimed political drama series that slithers behind the curtain of power, sex, ambition, love, greed and corruption in modern Washington D.C. From Academy Award nominated director David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network), Academy Award nominated writer Beau Willimon (The Ides of March), Academy Award winning writer Eric Roth (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Forrest Gump), and starring Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey (Horrible Bosses, American Beauty) and Golden Globe nominee Robin Wright (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Forrest Gump), the political thriller is an original series by Netflix and Sony Pictures Television.
An uncompromising exploration of power, ambition and the American way, the series orbits Francis Underwood (Spacey), the House Majority Whip. Underwood is the politician&rsquo;s politician &ndash; masterful, beguiling, charismatic and ruthless. He and his equally ambitious wife Claire (Wright) stop at nothing to ensure their ascendancy.
In addition to Spacey and Wright, the series also stars Kate Mara (American Horror Story), Corey Stoll (Midnight in Paris), Kristen Connolly (The Cabin in the Woods), Michael Kelly (The Adjustment Bureau) and Sakina Jaffrey (Definitely Maybe).
Fincher directed the first two episodes of the series, which were written by Willimon. James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross), Joel Schumacher (Falling Down), Charles McDougall (The Good Wife), Carl Franklin (Devil in a Blue Dress) and Alan Coulter (The Sopranos) also serve as directors on House of Cards.
Based on the critically acclaimed BBC miniseries of the same name, House of Cards trades in Parliament for the U.S. Capitol in the transnational and universal story of political deceit. Originally written as a novel by former U.K. Conservative Party Chief of Staff Lord Michael Dobbs, the adapted miniseries produced by Dobbs and Andrew Davies went on to win an Emmy Award in the writing category and BAFTA TV Award for the lead actor, among other honors.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:03:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-07-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:30:00</td></tr></table>
