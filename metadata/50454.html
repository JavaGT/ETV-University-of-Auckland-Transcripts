<tr><td align='left' valign='top'>etv/pan_am_tv_one_20130126_2100_640x360</td><td  align='left' valign='top'>Pan Am</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Pan Am is an American period drama television series created by writer Jack Orman.[2] Named for the iconic Pan American World Airways, the series features the pilots and stewardesses of the airline as it operated in the early 1960s at the beginning of the commercial Jet Age.

Pan Am premiered on ABC on September 25, 2011 and ended on February 19, 2012.  The time slot was subsequently filled by midseason replacement GCB. On May 11, 2012, both series were canceled by ABC.

In May 2012, Sony Pictures Television had conversations with Amazon about picking up the series for a second season because of its international success. It won the &quot;Best Series&quot; at the Rose d'Or TV awards, Europe's equivalent of the Emmys. 

Unable to reach a deal with Amazon, the series officially ended on June 20, 2012.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-01-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
