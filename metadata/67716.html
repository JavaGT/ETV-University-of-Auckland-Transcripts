After being silent for three days, the Machine generates six numbers of people spread across the country who have been reported missing. Reese and Finch conclude that they may be on the hunt of an identity thief. Added time pressure, and incentive to act, is provided when Finch finds burnt teeth among the ashes, all that remains of the final one of the six numbers they had been given earlier. At this point Detective Carter realizes that they are hunting a serial killer who assumes the identity of his victims. Reese, meanwhile, is on Owen Island where he encounters FBI agent Alan Fahey (Luke Macfarlane) who is also on the search for the same killer. Due to a severe storm all residents of the island who could not evacuate on time are now taking shelter in the police station. This leads Reese and Agent Fahey to realize that the killer must be among those stranded in the station. As Finch is unable to reach the island by car, he uses a sea plane to land, and arrives at the station under the guise of a meteorologist. He is able to fashion a makeshift lie-detector out of the devices he brought as cover, and Fahey uses them to interrogate the people in the station. Carter meanwhile has researched the first victim, and discovered that the serial killer was his roommate in college, and goes to help Finch and Reese. Cal Beecher, who Carter has been avoiding, confronts her with her avoidance, and when she explains where she is going, accompanies her to Owen Island. Meanwhile, Finch and Reese split up, and both independently discover that the killer is actually masquerading as Agent Fahey, whom he had killed before Reese arrived on the island. Reese is delayed by a drug smuggler whose operation he stumbled upon, while the killer captures Finch and begins the process of taking over Finch's cover identity, while explaining his motives. He believes he is living his victims' lives better than they ever could, and intends to stop once he has found the identity he was &quot;meant to have.&quot; Carter arrives and shoots the killer, who is wearing the real Agent Fahey's body armor; the killer is finally killed by Beecher. Finch and Reese later ponder why the Machine was silent for three days, with Finch suspecting that the virus Kara Stanton uploaded to the Department of Defense has infected the Machine and slowed its abilities. He tells Reese that he believes this is the beginning of a coming storm.
