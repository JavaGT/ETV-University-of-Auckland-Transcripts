We talk to one of the worlds leading architects who shows us round the UK's first zero carbon housing project and visit the Smile plastics factory where anything from old mobile phones to children's gumboots is turned in to building materials. The programme explores what makes a material sustainable, including: certification, recycling, and the inputs and carbon footprint required to create them. It talks to material scientists and examines the characteristics and properties of these materials. It then explores the benefits and limitations of using them and asks, what makes a building or product truly sustainable? 2009.
