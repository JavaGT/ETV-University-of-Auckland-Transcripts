They are some the toughest, most extreme survivalists that Alaska has to offer. Going head to head, eight men of a rare breed are about to take the ultimate test of survival in Arctic conditions that only National Geographic could inspire. Dropped in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness by bush plane, with only their raw, mountain-man ingenuity, they will navigate through treacherous glaciated river valleys, barren ridgelines, and high mountain peaks, battling hunger, hostile predators, and perilous weather conditions along the way. Like the original National Geographic explorers, for those who succeed there is no grand prize, just the well-fought pride of having conquered the grueling challenges that Mother Nature can throw at them. It's an epic competition series where the only prize is survival.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:50:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Geography, Natural History, Physical Education, Psychology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-09-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
