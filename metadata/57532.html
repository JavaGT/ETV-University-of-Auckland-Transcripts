Within aged care, culture has a major impact on how we work and how we communicate with patients and residents. 

Often a cultural adjustment needs to take place so that an appropriate and culturally sensitive level of care can be delivered to the aged care client. In this program we investigate what culture is and how we can make our communication relevant in the face of cultural barriers. We also look at different cultural groups and personal cultural history, while also considering individual religious practices and traditions.
