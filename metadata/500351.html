Scientists are interested in understanding how the molecular features of these chains influence the properties of biological materials. Soft samples are being studied using micro-rheological techniques which involve using light scattering and particle tracking microscopy to observe the thermal motion of small beads embedded within them. Today, many envisage that the smart materials and devices of the 21st century will be engineered at the nano-scale. Nature already performs such 'bottom-up' processing beautifully, assembling structures at the molecular level in order to yield materials with desired properties. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Bill Williams, Senior Lecturer in Physics at Massey University.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2006-12-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
