About the series:
Looking for love can be tricky, but some find it harder than others. The Undateables is an uplifting series that follows several extraordinary singletons as they enter the dating world in pursuit of love. From a stand-up comedian with Tourettes and a trapeze artist with brittle bones; to a media student with Down Syndrome; an amateur poet with a learning disability; and a skateboarder with a facial disfigurement, their quest to find love and companionship is full of highs and lows, but they're open to finding &quot;The One.&quot; With the help of one of the UK's leading personal introductions agencies and a specialist dating agency for people with learning difficulties, this touching series explores the realities of looking for love in a world where people make snap judgements or assumptions based on first impressions - and even consider some people to be 'undateable'.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-06-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
