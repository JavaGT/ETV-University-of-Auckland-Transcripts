&lsquo;This is a system that treats you better if you&rsquo;re rich and guilty, as opposed to if you&rsquo;re poor and innocent.&rsquo;

Anthony Hinton spent 28 years on death row in the United States after being falsely convicted of a double murder in the state of Alabama in 1985. He was finally released in 2015 and is now a community educator at the Equal Justice Initiative.

Hinton&rsquo;s case is not an outlier; at least five percent of the prison population is wrongly convicted. This means that about one in every 20 judgements puts an innocent person behind bars &ndash; more often than not a person of colour.

On UpFront, Marc Lamont Hill is joined by advocate and author Anthony Hinton for a look at the flaws in the system that lead to thousands of wrongful convictions.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PG</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-10-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
