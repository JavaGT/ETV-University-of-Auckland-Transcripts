After The Governor's first attack on the prison, Rick and his group debate their course of action. Hershel calls Rick out and wants him to take action and step up. In a private moment, while Rick is on watch, Carl confides to his father that he feels Rick should step down from his leadership role until he recovers. In Woodbury, Andrea learns of the attack on the prison and confronts The Governor, who claims he went to the prison to seek peace but was attacked. He begins to form a Woodbury army from anyone in town who can shoot a gun, including adolescents. Disturbed by this, Andrea asks The Governor for permission to visit the prison, but he refuses to give her a vehicle. Undeterred, Andrea asks Milton for his help in escaping Woodbury. Milton refuses to participate and reports back to the Governor, who instructs him to help Andrea escape on foot. In the woods outside Woodbury, Andrea and Milton capture a walker and disable it, as Michonne had done, so Andrea may use it as camouflage among the walkers on the way to the prison. As they do, Tyreese's group appears from the woods and, hearing that Milton is living in a protected town, asks for shelter. Milton takes them back to Woodbury as Andrea leaves to find the prison. Rick's group opens the gate for Andrea, and she is greeted with a mixture of warmth and suspicion. Andrea tries to persuade Rick and his group to make peace with The Governor, but she is informed of the Governor's aggression, and Michonne later reveals to Andrea that The Governor had sent Merle to kill her after she left Woodbury. Carol urges Andrea to end the conflict by returning to Woodbury, sleeping with The Governor to deter suspicion against her, then killing him while he sleeps. Meanwhile Hershel tries to connect with Merle, and Merle in turn tries to make amends with Michonne. In Woodbury, Tyreese's group reveal that they have been in the prison, and they agree to help The Governor in his war with Rick's group. Rick gives Andrea a car and gun so she can return, and he begins to plan a strike on Woodbury with Michonne and Carl. Back in Woodbury, Andrea lies in bed with the sleeping Governor and raises a knife to him but cannot bring herself to kill him.
