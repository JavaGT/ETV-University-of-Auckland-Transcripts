Michael arrives in Vietnam at a time when it is reintroducing itself to the global stage, via a process called Đổi mới (&quot;new thinking&quot;). He also observes a local cricket match in the capital of Hanoi, although the BBC is not allowed to film because due to the fact it took place on land owned by the Vietnamese military, it was deemed a security risk. Michael also observes the Hanoi Hilton, an infamous prison for Americans during the Vietnam War. Catching a train going south to Saigon, he makes a stop in Hue and the Forbidden Purple City, an old imperial palace. In Da Nang, Michael relaxes at China Beach and meets up with a 16-year-old who shows him what is known as the Gateway to Heaven. In Saigon, he tours the Củ Chi tunnels which the Vietnamese military used during all the conflicts within their borders. In nearby Tay Ninh, he visits a Caodaist cathedral. Then he takes a ferry down to the end of the Mekong River.

In the Philippines, Michael notices how congested traffic is in the capital of Manila. He then chats with some women who are going abroad to work in order to support their families. Michael then takes the opportunity to observe the Banaue Rice Terraces. However, when he gets there, a dense fog prevents him from seeing the terraces, causing frustrated and disbelieving laughter. In Baguio, he witnesses two unique procedures (assisting in one of them) known as &quot;psychic surgery&quot;. In the southern part of the country, Michael gets some scuba diving lessons and even has a meal underwater. In Zamboanga, he attends a cockfight and also judges the Miss La Bella Pacifica beauty pageant. Afterwards, he drives a jeepney down the streets of the city, waiting for a ferry to take him to Borneo.

The series documented a 10-month, 50,000 mile (80,000 km) trip taken by Palin and a film crew around the rim of the Pacific Ocean in 1995, beginning on the Diomede Islands between Alaska and Russia in the Bering Strait. The intent was to make the full anti-clockwise trip around the Pacific Rim and end up back on the Diomede Islands, but due to rough weather, he was unable to actually set foot back on the Islands again at the end of his journey. He got within 2 miles of completing the full circle. Palin travelled through Russia, Japan, South Korea (they were not allowed to travel very far in North Korea), China, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, United States, and Canada.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Ecology & Environment, Economics, Geography, History, Political Studies, Sociology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-12-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:30:00</td></tr></table>
