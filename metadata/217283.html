Produced by their grandson, the film has exclusive access to never-seen-before footage, photos, and love letters. Their four daughters share for the first time the entire story of their parents thirteen year marriage, the story of love at first sight, the endless tours, Cash's decent into drugs and alcohol, and the eventual divorce and heartbreak for them all. By that time Johnny had met the next Mrs Cash - June Carter.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:29:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, History, Media Studies, Music, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-11-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
