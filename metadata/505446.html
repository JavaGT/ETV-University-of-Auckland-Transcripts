Since making his television debut on TV Nation in the mid-90s, journalist and film-maker Louis Theroux has become synonymous with documentaries involving subcultures and people on the fringes of society.

In the first episode of this career retrospective, Louis looks back at his earliest documentaries and explores how some people&rsquo;s most fervent beliefs can bring them into conflict with mainstream society. From his Weird Weekends episodes on survivalists and UFOs to his now notorious documentary about the White Aryan Resistance in California (Louis and the Nazis), Louis has always been drawn to those whose beliefs seem unusual, confused or, in some cases, abhorrent.

Louis catches up again with some of his previous contributors, including Mike Cain, who he first met in the mid-90s, having moved to the hills of Idaho and armed himself for what he saw as an inevitable war with the federal government. Over 20 years later, his views haven&rsquo;t changed much &ndash; but in Donald Trump, he has a president who finally speaks to him. Louis also tracks down Lamb and Lynx, once members of the white nationalist pop group Prussian Blue. They have since rejected their past and believe their story gives hope that even the most indoctrinated can change their beliefs.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Law, Media Studies, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-10-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
