The first model wears large stripey bloomers which apparently &quot;will never lose their shape&quot;. As the original British Path&eacute; canister notes put it: &quot;Two rows of sedately dressed ladies are watching the show&quot;. We then see a pink and white nylon taffeta &quot;house coat&quot;, underneath it is a matching night gown. Then a blonde model with very long legs wears a yellow swimsuit with matching jacket and pom poms, designed by Teddy Tinling. Next there are halter neck swim dresses by Rigby and Peller.
