Sara and Oliver are attacked at Queen Mansion by a man dressed like Malcolm Merlyn. Sara reveals that the man, Al-Owal, is a member of the League of Assassins and is targeting her for leaving the League. Felicity manages to trace Al-Owal to an abandoned manufacturing plant from the dirt he left behind. Oliver and Sara fight with Al-Owal and two other League members to a stalemate. They manage to escape and Al-Owal threatens to kill Sara's family. Oliver manages to protect Laurel, but Quentin refuses to heed Felicity's warning. To protect her father, Sara reveals she is alive to him and brings him to her location in the clock tower. Together with Oliver, they manage to stop the League's second attack, with Sara killing Al-Owal. Afterwards, Sara decides to leave Starling City to keep her family safe, entrusting her secret to Quentin. Elsewhere, Moira, with the encouragement of her children, decides to fight the death penalty charge even after being offered a plea agreement for life in prison. In flashbacks, after being left adrift from the Queen's Gambit wreckage, Sara is rescued and brought aboard the Amazo, where she meets Dr. Anthony Ivo, who asks her to help him with his experiments.

'Arrow' is an American action-adventure television series developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Andrew Kreisberg.

The series follows billionaire playboy Oliver Queen, portrayed by Stephen Amell, who, after five years of being stranded on a hostile island, returns home to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrows. Arrow will also feature appearances by other DC Comics characters. To assist in promotion, a preview comic book was released to tie into the television series.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
