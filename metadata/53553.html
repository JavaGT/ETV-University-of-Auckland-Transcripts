They are some of the most fascinating characters of our history, yet few know who they are. These are the stories of Māori painted by the artist Gottfried Lindauer. Over seven episodes, the personal stories of twenty-one tūpuna are presented with startling honesty by their descendants.

'Behind The Brush' is made with the support of Te Māngai Pāho, NZOnAir and the Auckland Art Gallery, Toi o Tāmaki which holds the largest collection of Lindauer paintings. Produced by AWA Films and directed by Julian Arahanga.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History, Maori, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata Māori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-04-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
