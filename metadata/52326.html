All hell breaks loose on Traci&rsquo;s first day as detective when a carload of young women from a bachelorette party slams into another vehicle, apparently killing the driver. When the police discover that the driver of the parked car was dead before the accident, Traci realizes that her &ldquo;rookie&rdquo; handling of the car crash may have compromised the pending homicide investigation. Meanwhile, as Gail and Chris work together on the case, Chris realizes not only that he still has feelings for Gail, but that he has competition. Finally, when Traci and Andy uncover a secret the bride is desperately trying to keep, it is a race to find the murderer before he strikes again.
