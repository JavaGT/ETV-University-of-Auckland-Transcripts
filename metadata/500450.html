The future in 3&times;7
Three industry powerhouses reveal fast-paced, provocative predictions about the future of advertising all with seven minutes each.

Andy McLeish, Head of Planning, ColensoBBDO

After a 15-year career in strategy, product development and marketing roles in client organisations, including seven years at NZ Lotteries, Andy made the move across to agency life in 2009. And the benefit of experience at executive level on both sides of the fence has proven invaluable for both agency and the clients with whom Andy has worked. A year at TBWA saw him run strategic planning across clients such as ASB, Sovereign Insurance and The Radio Network.

Andy moved to Colenso BBDO in 2010 to lead strategy on Westpac and Frucor Beverages. He became Head of Planning in March 2012 and for the last two years has overseen strategy across the whole client portfolio.

Andy&rsquo;s work has been recognised both in New Zealand and globally with various marketing, creative and effectiveness awards over a number of years.

Steve Ballantyne, Director, BallantyneTaylor

Steve&rsquo;s passion for innovative branding strategy &ndash; on and offline &ndash; has culminated from 25 years spent starting and building many businesses of his own in New Zealand and Australia. With 15 years as managing director of BallantyneTaylor, he&rsquo;s also become adept at helping others grow their businesses into strong brands too.
Using his coal face business experience and extensive knowledge of brand building and digital marketing, he helps businesses harness the possibilities of the evolving marketing environment and emerging technologies to create integrated marketing campaigns with more bite.

As founding partner of BallantyneTaylor he has worked with leading Australasian companies including Canon, Nufarm, Lockwood, Westfield, Wrightson, Ballance, AgResearch, TrustPower, Anchor, Lumley Insurance, AON, CallPlus Group, David Forman, Danske Mobler, and Unitec.
