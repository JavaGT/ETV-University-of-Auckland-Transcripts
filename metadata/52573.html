He's hoping to bring a bit of eco-friendliness to the construction industry with his waste recycling business. Manchester based Naomi Timperley and her American business partner Andy Hurwitz look to get the Dragons into the groove of their Baby Loves Disco project - a novel take on night clubbing for both parents and children. And Simon Boyle, a chef with a Jamie Oliver-like mission to get homeless people back to work also pitches for investment.

There will also be a look at some of the most memorable investments of the series and a catch up with a couple of the entrepreneurs to seeing how they're getting on.

'Dragons' Den' continues with more intrepid entrepreneurs pitching Britain's brightest ideas to the multimillionaire investors. Will any of them manage to make the Dragons part with their cash?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:01:36</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Business</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-03-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
