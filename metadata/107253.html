About the series:
The long-running late-night talk show returned in 2014 to New York for the first time since 1972 when comic Jimmy Fallon took over hosting duties, accompanied by his Grammy-winning house band, The Roots. The former cast member of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and lead of a later show welcomes guests to an evening of comedy, music, conversation and competitions. Lorne Michaels serves as the program's executive producer.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Interview, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-06-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>23:20:00</td></tr></table>
