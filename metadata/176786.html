A dry-witted woman, known only as Fleabag, has no filter as she navigates life and love in London while trying to cope with tragedy. The angry, grief-riddled woman tries to heal while rejecting anyone who tries to help her, but Fleabag continues to keep up her bravado through it all. Comic actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge stars as the titular character on the series, which is based on Waller-Bridge's 2013 one-woman show of the same name.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-02-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
