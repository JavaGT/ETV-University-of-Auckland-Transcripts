A dark, riveting odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the evolution of sin explores a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged.

After the jaw-dropping end of the last season, the story continues as the hosts continue to realise the truth of their own existence. An ambitious and highly imaginative series, Westworld elevates the concept of adventure and thrill-seeking to a new, ultimately dangerous level. In the not-too-distant future, guests pay exorbitant amounts to be immersed in the Westworld fantasy park universe, where every detail and scenario &ndash; including those involving the android &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; that are virtually indistinguishable from humans &ndash; have been planned, scripted and executed by a team of brilliant scientists and programmers working in close proximity to the park. The hosts, who are regularly updated to make them more lifelike, are programmed to stay in their &ldquo;loops&rdquo; with minimal improvisation, and their memories are erased at the end of each narrative. But it soon becomes apparent that updating a host&rsquo;s thought and behavioural patterns can backfire.
