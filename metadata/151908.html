About series:
Christopher Eccleston, Lee Ingleby and Morven Christie return for the second series of the drama about a messy, extended family with a child with autism at its centre. Written by BAFTA-winning Peter Bowker (Marvellous, Occupation, Blackpool) the story picks up two years on from where we left it and Joe (Max Vento) is changing. Now age seven, Joe has begun to look at the world and finds he doesn&rsquo;t fit in. The six-part drama revisits the funny, messy, mixed-up lives of the Hughes and Scott families as they struggle to do their best as parents, carers, lovers&hellip;. and to work out what&rsquo;s really important in the face of nothing ever feeling normal.
Ahead of the Season 2 premiere, we caught up with Morven Christie (who plays Alison Hughes) and asked her a few questions...

How would Alison describe herself?

I think Alison would describe herself as quite forthright; quite... I think she&rsquo;s quite a passionate person about whatever thing she&rsquo;s passionate about at that moment. And I think that the focus of her life, really, is her family. 

I think because she&rsquo;s not... she doesn&rsquo;t have a, sort of, solid career, particularly as we find her in the second series. She did have this diner that she was running, which she sold to support her husband&rsquo;s business. So, she just works there part time and, really, the focus of her life is her family. Is looking after Joe and, sort of, helping out with the community, the autism community.

So, I think she would describe herself as passionate, forthright, yes, maybe that's all.

What is series two of The A Word about?

Series two of The A Word is really about... If series one was about denial, then this series is about acceptance. It&rsquo;s about how this family, rather than cope with the diagnosis, actually work with the reality of having a child on the spectrum.

And his particular, personal issues within education, and all of those kinds of things, really come to the fore, as he&rsquo;s getting older. So, the communicative difficulties that he has, or the social difficulties that he has, they start to become more prevalent within his school environment. And it&rsquo;s really, this series, about how they deal with those. How they move forward.

It&rsquo;s also about, I think, how all the relationships within the family have grown and changed. And I think that's quite pointed in this series. I think, where Alison and Paul were... they obviously had their opposing sides of conversations, but I think, fundamentally, they were quite together.

Whereas, this series, it really feels like Alison&rsquo;s journey, and Paul&rsquo;s journey, aren&rsquo;t in tandem. They're quite separate. And it&rsquo;s what that manifests into, towards the end. So, I think all of the characters have got quite a lot that they're juggling this time around. For Alison, certainly, there's... I think that she has learned to communicate with Joe. She&rsquo;s worked really hard to learn how to communicate with Joe, and I think she&rsquo;s quite proud of that.

And she&rsquo;s very engaged in the autism community, and helping other parents, and in really, sort of, focusing on being accepting of where he is in, like, his school journey, and things like that. And having to work with, rather than try to force him into being in mainstream education, or, you know... But, actually, working with what is right for Joe. And I think that is absolutely her focus, and maybe other things fall back a little bit.

Or, she takes them for granted a little bit, because she&rsquo;s, sort of, so focused on that. And, I think, Paul and Alison&rsquo;s journeys have almost, sort of, switched places. So, where, in series one, Paul was very accepting of Joe&rsquo;s condition, Alison was really struggling with it. She, sort of, battled denial for the... for the whole series.

And now, it&rsquo;s, kind of... it&rsquo;s, sort of, switched around. We&rsquo;re two years on, but it&rsquo;s, kind of... they've moved in different directions with how they feel about his autism. So, that then pushes their relationship into quite difficult places.

What makes the central story of Joe and his family so compelling?

I think, for me, what&rsquo;s compelling about Joe and his family, is that you very rarely really see difference on television.

And there's something about Joe, he&rsquo;s different, and he&rsquo;s different to the children we normally see on television. And he&rsquo;s different to the children in this class. And he&rsquo;s different to the people in his family. But, he&rsquo;s also, sort of, pure of heart. And I think that's really arresting.

And, I find it very moving. So, watching how everyone around him struggles with that, or succeeds at dealing with that, is just compelling. It&rsquo;s just a really fascinating thing to watch. And I think... I think, also, you start to see, you learn, through watching Joe, how the... how the, sort of, human flaws in the other members of his family, it, kind of, highlights them. It, sort of... it, sort of, just shines a light on them.

So, you can see how they behaviours affect Joe in a much more obvious way than you could a child that wasn&rsquo;t on the autism spectrum. But, I think, also, what makes it compelling is just... is just Pete&rsquo;s writing, and the fact that he manages to balance... And this is just something that Pete does, in all of his work, I think, but... I think it&rsquo;s in it&rsquo;s prime in The A Word, where he bounces his comedy off of pathos.

And, what&rsquo;s moving against what&rsquo;s funny. And it just makes both sing out. I just think there's a lot of warmth at the heart of it, and people trying to get things right. And I think, just... people identify with that. So, whether or not you have experience of a child who had... who has autism or not, I think there's something pure of heart about Joe that we all, kind of, understand and identify with, and want to protect.

And so, I think that... it makes the audience invest, in a way, that just brings them into everybody&rsquo;s lives in a much more intense way, I think.

Has Max Vento grown into the character of Joe?

Max is amazing. Like he... So, he&rsquo;s seven now... well, he&rsquo;s nearly eight. And, obviously, for any child from... you know, he&rsquo;d just turned six when we started series one, and that&rsquo;s quite a... that is quite a big jump for a kid.

This year, he understands who Joe is, so he can, sort of, switch in and out quite quickly. It&rsquo;s still always blows me away, just how different his Joe is, from Max.

Max is just livewire, I mean, he just keeps everyone really on their toes. I think... He&rsquo;s just... He&rsquo;s very funny. He&rsquo;s massively energetic. But, he&rsquo;s just a really, really brilliant little actor. He&rsquo;s put in so much detail this year; the repetitive behaviours and things, that, you know... Sue Tully, who directed our first block, is an absolute master at working with him.

But, it brought out the best in both them, and watching him work has been... I just find it a real pleasure, I love Max.

What have you most enjoyed about Alison&rsquo;s story this series?

I think what I've most enjoyed about Alison&rsquo;s story this year, or of playing Alison this year, is that, last year it felt like she was in a battle with herself all the time.

And, that was really hard, because I could really identify with that battle, but it&rsquo;s... I think it&rsquo;s really difficult to sustain being in that place. It, kind of... for me, playing her, it, sort of... it felt like... you know, when I finished filming, it took quite a long time to get all that tension of her off myself.

And I think what&rsquo;s been wonderful for me this year... but, having said that, I love the challenge of that as an actor. But, what&rsquo;s been lovely for me this year, playing her, is that she&rsquo;s accepted the path that she&rsquo;s on and committed to it. And she&rsquo;s, sort of, learned how not to lose her shape at every challenge. To, kind of, like: okay, I hear that. Right, I understand it. Right, what do I do with it?

She&rsquo;s just more reasoned. She&rsquo;s learned a lot, I think, and she&rsquo;s learned it in a really difficult way. I think, by the end of series one, she really did not like herself very much. And I think that's very difficult for any person, particularly if they're a parent and they're... they're... they've become aware of what they are imposing on their child.

And I think she&rsquo;s working very hard now not to do that. I really enjoy the relationship she has with Joe now, just that they have a way of communicating, that they both get joy from. That's been a real gift. I mean, I love her, I've got... I just, like... I, sort of... I&rsquo;d, kind of, fight tigers over Alison. Like, I love her. So, it&rsquo;s been lovely for me to see her... what I think are some of her best qualities coming out.

Where, in series one, I think she was in such a battle that these all, kind of, lost themselves inside her, so... 

Any challenges filming this year?

I think filming in the Lakes is always a challenge, because when we&rsquo;re in the Lakes, we&rsquo;re filming almost entirely outside. And the weather just changes very dramatically, very quickly, and so we&rsquo;re a slave to it, and that can be massively challenging.

We&rsquo;ve had some big challenges with that this year. And I think we&rsquo;d come back to shoot this series in spring and summer, thinking: oh, well, last year we had to deal with snow, and floods, and... you know. And we thought: oh, spring and summer, it&rsquo;ll be... No, we&rsquo;ve still had torrential rain. We began when there was snow on the hills, but it was boiling on the ground. And we finished up there when it was absolutely apocalyptically raining. So, it&rsquo;s always a real challenge from that point of view.

And that, I think... that is more difficult for the crew than for anybody else, because they don't get any respite from it. You know, actors get to... you're, sort of, on set, and then you get to go and hide for a bit, and then come back. You know, they are just in it. They're doing all their work when we&rsquo;re not on camera, a lot of the time. So, it&rsquo;s relentless of them, and really, really tough. But, we do have probably 95% of our crew from series one back.

And I just love them, they're just such a brilliant, brilliant gang of people. I think they're really committed to the material. They're all jut lovely individuals. There's not a single one of them that I wouldn't just love to have... sit down and have a drink with. And that's unique, you know, it&rsquo;s a really special thing. and I think it, kind of, comes from the material. I think everyone loves the material and it brings out the best in people.

It means they're incredibly patient about horrendous conditions, and, sort of, you know... because I think they're committed to what they're doing. But, it really does feel like a proper family, like, I feel like I really know all these people. you know &ndash; they're our family. Yes, it&rsquo;s a really special bunch.

Why should people watch the second series of The A Word?

I think people should watch the second series of The A Word, because things have moved on.

I think it&rsquo;s quite rare that you... Normally when you come back to a second season of something, there's only been a few months in between. But, with this, it&rsquo;s a year and a half since we shot series one. And so, Joe is bigger; his particular difficulties and his particular cool things, they've all changed, and grown, and developed in ways that are both, you know, alarming, and worrying, and also really loveable.

So, there's that. But, I also think every one of the characters this year has developed in some way. And I think all of the storylines, all of the characters are, kind of, served by their own storylines. And, it&rsquo;s, sort of... when I read the first... we get the scripts in blocks. So, we got one, two, and three. And then we shot one, two, and three. And then we got the later scripts.

And when I... So, when I received the first block scripts, I sent a message to Pete and said: I think this might the best thing you've ever written. Because, it&rsquo;s really gold. And it&rsquo;s everything that he&rsquo;s good at, at its best. It&rsquo;s the best of the comedy. It&rsquo;s the best of the sadness. It&rsquo;s the best of the warmth. And I think that brings out the best in everyone that's part of making it. So, I do think we&rsquo;ve made something really special. I hope we have.

What do you hope viewers will take from it?

There's something quite big that this show has to say about individuality, I think. Which doesn&rsquo;t just apply to somebody who has autism. It applies to every character that's in the show and every person on the planet, I think. Each one of these characters is distinct in their own way.

And, there&rsquo;s, sort of, an acceptance of who each one of them is, in the writing. And so, I, kind of, think... I hope people take something of that away from it: that it&rsquo;s okay for Joe to be Joe, but also, it&rsquo;s okay for them to be them.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-04-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
