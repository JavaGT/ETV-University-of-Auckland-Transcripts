A professional assassin known only as Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) gets caught up in a dangerous political takeover. He flees across Eastern Europe, hoping to find out who set him up and why. However, his growing attachment to a beautiful but traumatised young woman poses as great a threat to his survival as that of the Interpol and Russian agents who are hunting him down.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:29:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Criminology, Media Studies, Political Studies, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Movies Action</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-06-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:10:00</td></tr></table>
