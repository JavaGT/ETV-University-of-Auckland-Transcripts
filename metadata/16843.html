How would nature react and how swiftly? This program takes place at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, hastily abandoned by panic-stricken humans 20 years ago. On April 25 and 26 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 128 kilometres north of Kiev in the former USSR (now Ukraine) lost control of one of its four reactors, creating a series of explosions. A devastating fireball blew off the reactor's heavy steel and concrete lid. Highly radioactive fall-out flooded everything within a 32 kilometre radius. 35,000 cattle and 135,000 people were evacuated and only wild animals remained. While humans have made life in this land impossible for themselves, the animals have found a way and they have not just survived, they have thrived.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ANIMAL PLANET</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-09-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:30:00</td></tr></table>
