On the Train to Nowhere:  Was the opening night of the Rugby World Cup marred by public transport problems? At least 2,000 people missed the opening ceremony due to train delays. Does that warrant compensation? Do we need more trains? Is the failure due to anti-train bias? And what about the riders who kept pushing the emergency stop buttons? Can this be cleared up before the end of the cup? And do we really need to look at how we get around town?

Are We Safer? This week the world commemorates the 10th anniversary of 9/11. The terror attacks may have been on American soil but the reverberations spread far wider. 9/11 saw law changes in New Zealand, changes in aviation, changes the way we see each other. Ten years onare we any safer? And if you were to look ahead ten yearswhere will we be?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ7</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-09-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:04:00</td></tr></table>
