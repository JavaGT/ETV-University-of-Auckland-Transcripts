About series:
Born This Way is back for a second season following a group of seven young adults born with Down syndrome as they pursue their passions and lifelong dreams, explore friendships, romantic relationships and work, all while defying society&rsquo;s expectations.

In their willingness and courage to openly share their lives, through a lens that is not often shown on television, we learn they have high hopes just like anyone else. The series also gives voice to the parents, allowing them to talk about the joy their son or daughter brings to their family, and the challenges they face in helping them live as independently as possible.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-04-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:40:00</td></tr></table>
