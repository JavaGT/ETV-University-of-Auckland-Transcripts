Project Whenua is an environmental science series for M훮ori Television, put together by the team that bought you Project M훮tauranga.  

Taking a fresh look at the &lsquo;hands on&rsquo; science that&rsquo;s happening out in the catchments, rivers and forests of Aotearoa, the series is focused on  innovative environmental projects that utilise M훮ori knowledge and concepts. We look at these issues in detail, showcasing the science behind them as our field reporter, environmental scientist, Tuaiwa Darcel Rickard, walks the viewer through the processes and discusses the ins and outs with the workers involved.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Instructional, Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Maori, New Zealand, Science, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata M훮ori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-12-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
