This film follows the annual overhaul of the 'Tasman Class' Sandringham ZK-AMD at Hobsonville airbase and the meticulous engines checkup at Mechanics Bay. Instruments are also shown being checked and repaired. The pilots on the next flight attend a weather briefing. Passengers are checked in, baggage is weighed, meals are prepared and loaded, reconditioned motors are checked including a full throttle test. The flight across the Tasman is shown from the cockpit, the ground control at Musik Point and inside the cabin. The Sandringham flies over coastal New South Wales and on to Sydney before landing on the harbour at Rose Bay. City scenes of Sydney show a bustling metropolis with a population greater than all of New Zealand. Next morning, the Sandringham flies back to Auckland.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:10:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
