NZ Season continues with an unflinching look at the treatment of children in state care last century. Little Criminals investigates how the experience has shaped lives, producing a new generation of criminals, and the battles others have fought to overcome their trauma. The Epuni Boys&rsquo; Home was the most infamous of the 26 juvenile institutions run by the New Zealand Government from the 1960s to 1990s. Here children were thrust into a prison&ndash;like world, where violent offenders mixed with kids under protection until decisions were made about their future. Here they were simply little criminals, held in an institute where abuse and brutal punishments were a fact of life.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Law, Media Studies, New Zealand, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-07-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
