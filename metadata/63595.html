One season it's Indian gypsies, the next it's senior citizens. This season, Gaultier stepped it up by throwing in a little humor and making it high fashion.  His theme was cat ladies - in other words, ladies who are literally cats. Lions, tigers, cougars, oh my! The collection featured women as strong felines and their catwoman getups were leopard print tough galore mixed with everything from animalistic motifs to animal print spots and fur that only the best pussycats could pull off.
