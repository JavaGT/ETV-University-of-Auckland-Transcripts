Only twenty years ago, steam locomotives could still be seen thundering through mountainous cuttings, over sky-scraping viaducts or across endless plains, to make one of the world's most spectacular railway systems.

Today steam has vanished from New Zealand's main trunk line. The immaculately restored 145 ton Ks 945 from Paekakariki and the greyhound-like 110 ton Ja 1250 from Auckland's Glenbrook Vintage Railway work a spectacular double header down New Zealand's North Island main trunk railway.

The beautiful Ka 945 also appears at the head of 1985's Manawatu Excursion for enthusiasts. STEAM LIVES ON also features the classic National Film Unit feature &quot;Kb Country&quot;. Once New Zealand's most powerful steam loco, Kb series slogged through the South Island Alps bringing coal and timber to Christchurch from the wild West Coast. &quot;Kb Country&quot; is a unique record of the land, the machines and the men who fired them.

As a bonus, STEAM LIVES ON features &quot;The ride of 480&quot;. The story of the epic 1000 kilometre journey of the quaint tank engine Ww480 under it's own steam from Greymouth on the South Island's West Coast northward to preservation in Auckland's Glenbrook Vintage Railway.

Experience all the power and the glory of steam in New Zealand with this 50 minute video, shot on big-screen 35mm film and carefully transferred to video tape for sparkling quality.

This is a fantastic video showing some of the best steam footage of the K class.
