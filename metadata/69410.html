When the money from asset sales starts rolling in one of the things the Government intends spending it on is water storage for irrigation.
But the jury is out on how much economic return irrigation provides, and how much large scale irrigation will cost.
Not to mention concerns about intensification, fertiliser run-off and effluent harm to the environment.
There are also issues with finding the land to build dams on.
In the Wairarapa there's a clear example of that problem - a group of landowners who may be asked to sacrifice their homes and livelihoods for the good of the economy.

Catching a Wellington burglar
Burglaries - Campbell Live has looked, in the past few months, at the police response to them. Is it too slow and, sometimes, is it not at all?
Only 14.6 percent of burglaries and break-ins were resolved last year.
Obviously police have to prioritise. If resources are stretched, crimes against people will take priority over crimes against property.
But if your home's burgled by someone brazen enough to be in it while you're asleep, that's pretty traumatic. You'd hope police would come then, surely?
And if you had video footage of the same culprit in action, then, surely, the police would come.
Anna Burns-Francis meets a Wellington couple who may have helped to solve their own break-in and possibly a couple of others.

Auckland street signs to change colour
The Auckland Council has confirmed it will be changing the colour of the city's street signs.
Before the creation of the Super City Council, street signs were a mix of blue and green.
But not any longer, says the Council, now the signs must all be the same colour.
After saying it would make a decision in mid-2014, it has confirmed they will be replaced, at a significant cost to ratepayers.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:50</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-11-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
