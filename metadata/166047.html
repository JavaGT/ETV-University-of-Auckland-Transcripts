The journey to every wedding day brings tears and tension, chaos and compromise. So what happens when you try to send two vastly different cultures down the aisle? The answer: you double-down on the stress and drama and buckle up for an epic, colourful tale of love against the odds. Marry Me, Marry My Family is the amazing story of cross-cultural weddings in Australia, following a wildly diverse cast of couples as they try to straddle the gulf between cultures, the gap between their parents' expectations and their own dreams. The path to wedded bliss in these multicultural mixes is not always smooth; it&rsquo;s a case of cross-cultural courtship, conflict and eventually a celebration.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:47</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-07-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
