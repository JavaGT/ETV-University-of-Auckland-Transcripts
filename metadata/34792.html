Full of cheeky wit and wordplay, the show gives viewers - at any level of Maori language - the opportunity to develop both their knowledge and understanding of the language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The show is hosted by Clinton Randell (Te Rarawa) and Maori language expert, Scotty Morrison (Te Arawa), who has the final word on matters of language.  Highly respected for his Maori language proficiency, the Te Karere presenter acts as Matanga Reo (language consultant), explaining answers in full and dishing out points at his discretion.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:26:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-08-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>09:29:00</td></tr></table>
