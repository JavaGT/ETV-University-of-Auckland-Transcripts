When is playing a sport more than just a game? For the Native American Iroquois nations, or Haudenosaunee, lacrosse is central to their cultural heritage and a fundamental means of honouring the earth&rsquo;s creator. Twelfth century indigenous Americans developed the game to sharpen their hunting skills and strengthen the mind and body. Today, Native American athletes are among the sport's top players. The documentary &ldquo;Spirit Game: Pride of a Nation&rdquo; follows the 2015 Iroquois Nationals lacrosse team and their fight to be recognised as a sovereign nation in international competition. We'll speak to Native lacrosse athletes on how cultural identity affects the way they play the game.
