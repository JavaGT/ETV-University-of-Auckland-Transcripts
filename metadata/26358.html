He tries out anything that will help tone it up, including the ancient and revolting art of drinking your own pee. Tim also sits in on the very latest and very bloody hair transplant procedure, observing a man literally having individual hair follicles gouged out of the back of his head and transplanted into the front. He puts the finishing touches to his new look with a back, sack and crack wax, before revealing the new Tim to his utterly shocked wife Hayley. Meanwhile Tim's friends in the locker room reveal just how important the face is to the average man, and we meet 40-year-old biker Jay Wheddon, who lost his looks after taking steroids to cure an illness. He's desperate to get them back and is going under the knife in order to do so. Plus we find out which hunk is the winner of Men's Health magazine's cover model competition.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:05:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-09-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:28:00</td></tr></table>
