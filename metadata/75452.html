Reese and Finch get the number of Hayden Price (Aaron Staton), a hypnotherapist. Finch, who poses as Hayden's patient, learns that Hayden is a con man who hypnotizes his patients into giving him their security information, which allows him to enter their bank accounts and steal from them. One of his patients, Sven Vanger (Carsten Norgaard), is in fact a money launderer for HR who bids fake items at auctions. One of the items he purchased is a baseball signed by the 1922 New York Yankees team, which is worth $4,000,000. Sven sells it for $5, believing it to be a fake. Hayden had in fact spoofed an email to Sven that instructed him to bid on a different lot number, which was the real ball. HR learns that Hayden is a con artist and wants him dead, as well as Sven. Carter has Laskey spy on Simmons while she and Fusco fake Sven's death. HR, however, then needs Sven alive, because the ball has been lost. They abduct Hayden's girlfriend Natalie (Jennifer Ferrin), who Hayden wants to go on vacation with and is scamming money for that reason. Hayden buys the ball from the client that Sven sold the ball to earlier, and agrees to give it to HR in exchange for Natalie. When Terney of HR takes Hayden to the auction house, the ball is revealed to be a fake, which shocks both Terney and Hayden. Reese saves Hayden, who calls Natalie to check if she is okay. Natalie reveals that she is also a con artist and has been scamming Hayden all along, and buys the real ball for $100. Hayden says that he is ruined, but Reese suggests that he find a job in another city. That night, Laskey shows Carter the pictures he has taken of Simmons' activities, when Terney comes in with his gun drawn. Terney shoots Laskey dead, and Carter responds by shooting Terney almost immediately after. She begs a dying Terney to tell her if the head of HR is in one of Laskey's pictures, and Terney places his bloodstained finger on the picture of Alonzo Quinn.
