The World Vision report found many imported cosmetics contained ingredients from known child labour hotspots.
New Zealand imports an estimated $370 million worth of cosmetics a year.

There are now calls on beauty brands and the Government to do more to ensure products are free of worker exploitation.

The global charity highlighted the case of two brothers in Uganda, who guard their family's vanilla farm at night, risking their lives to protect the precious spice from thieves.

In video provided by World Vision, the brothers described their fear when a thief came to their farm at night, and they narrowly missed being speared as they fled for help.
