But he has grander plans to be a great history painter. His meticulous attention to emotion means he takes far too long to complete important commissions, bringing him into conflict with Amsterdam&rsquo;s most powerful patrons.

He falls in love with and marries Saskia van Uylenburgh. Together they enjoy their new-found riches, amassing an incredible personal collection of artwork, exotic curios, stuffed animals and valuable prints, much of which Rembrandt buys at auctions with alarming regularity. He begins to attract a reputation &ndash; one that would dog him throughout his life and even after his death &ndash; for being a spendthrift. Yet he continues to create works that declare himself to be among the great old masters like Titian, Raphael and Michelangelo. A hubris which is dramatically paralleled with personal tragedies &ndash; the deaths of three of his children in infancy, and Saskia &ndash; which nonetheless influence some of his most poignant and moving works

About series:
To mark the 350th anniversary of his death, this enlightening series unravels two mysteries about the great painter. Firstly, how did an incendiary talent like Rembrandt, in his youth the darling of the Dutch art world and high society, end up in a pauper&rsquo;s grave? How could an artist who once would have been considered rich from the income he received from his art students come to such an ignominious end?

Then there is the question of his afterlife. Today, Rembrandt is considered one of the most famous artists in European history. In 2015, two of his portraits sold for &euro;160 million. Why was his work so often misunderstood in his own lifetime and why is his work so highly prized today? What have we found in his pictures in the last 350 years that many of Rembrandt&rsquo;s contemporaries simply could not see?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-09-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
