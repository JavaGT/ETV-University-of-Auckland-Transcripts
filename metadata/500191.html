At low tide, gangs of men work to stop further erosion but complete sealing of the breach will be a major engineering exercise. 50,000 sandbags will be needed merely to keep the tide in check. Marram grass is planted on the spit for more erosion control. 01.25 Flame Thrower: This new portable flame thrower is ideal for controlling gorse and blackberry and break in new land. It's also an all-purpose sprayer for ornamental, vegetable and fruit farming. 02.30 Arts, Maori Carving. An exhibition in Wellington shows a selection of Maori carvings by Ranginui Porete who is using the books of Augustus Hamilton to reproduce old works that have been lost. Incuded is a Porete original - a shield commemorating members of the Otaki Football Club killed in the war. The carver is seen working at home while his wife prepares the red ochre used in staining the finished work. 04.30 Oamaru, the Limestone Industry: At a limestone quarry near Oamaru, blocks of limestone are broken up in the first stage of preparing the limestone for fertilizer. Inside the completely mechanized fertilizer plant, the process continues to provide lime that is used on farms nationwide. At the same factory, the limestone is cut into blocks for use as a durable building material - the famous Oamaru Stone.
