About Series 6:
we ride along with Police Delta dog teams in Wellington, Whanganui and Tauranga watching them track down wrongdoers. Top dog team and winners of the Police Patrol and Detector dog Championship Ben and Ox show how well they can perform when confronted with real scenarios on the streets of Wellington. 

Delta team Paul and Epic who featured in Dog Squad 5 continue to show they have lost none of their knack when it comes to tracking down bad guys and New Zealand&rsquo;s only female Police dog handler Sue and her trusty German Shepherd Hades prove that they are up there with their male counterparts when faced the task of tracking and catching offenders. In Whaganui Delta team Jason and Farris are faced with every task from tracking down daylight robbers to calming down street brawls and abusive neighbours.In Tauranga we follow former champion teams Derek and Turk and Kayne and Yoda tracking down arsonists and burglars.

Customs drug detector teams continue to successfully halt attempts to smuggle illegal drugs across the border and we also get to see how the recently trained cash detecting dogs perform when put to the task of detecting large volumes of money. The Ministry for Primary Industries detector dog teams make some interesting and highly unusual intercepts which pose threats to New Zealand&rsquo;s biosecurity. At Auckland&rsquo;s International mail centre the dogs sniff out skulls infested with maggots, a taxidermied zoo and several packages containing plant material that are also found to contain hallucginc properties which become of interest to Customs. At the airport beagle Watchman and the other MPI teams sniff out foodstuffs and biosecurity threats, preventing them from making it across the border.

At Prison sites around the country from Ngawha in the North down to Christchurch in the South, Corrections drug dog teams show how good they are at sniffing out what they are trained to detect, and more often than not alongside illegal drugs other contraband not permitted on prison sites is also located, everything from serious weapons like nunchucks to alcohol to gang regalia are located.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Law, Science, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-05-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
