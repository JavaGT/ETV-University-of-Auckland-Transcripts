Some are not only fearful of contracting the virus but of how they will be treated if they get sick. As the number of cases increases, and with it pressure on medical supplies and ventilators, many people with disabilities worry they could be on the losing side of a doctor's life-or-death decision.

Others are a more hopeful and believe that, in this time of pandemic, others could learn lessons in resilience, adaptability and mutual support from the disabled community.

On this episode of The Stream, we are joined by people in the disability community to understand what challenges they are facing, and what lessons we can learn from them.
