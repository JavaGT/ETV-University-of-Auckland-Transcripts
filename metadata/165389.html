Summoned from her coastal home to claim her rightful inheritance, the unstoppable Peregrine Fisher manages to make her way into her Aunt Phryne&rsquo;s old seat at the coveted Adventuresses club after a series of trials designed to test her skills and moral fibre.  Armed with Phryne&rsquo;s old pearl-handled revolver, Peregrine dives headfirst into the murder investigation of Barbie Jones &ndash; a glamorous model who was found dead, perched on top of a designer wedding cake prop during a fashion parade by respected designer and much-loved Adventuress, Florence Astor. Having charmed the Adventuresses, Peregrine must now prove her worth to D.I. James Steed, a dashingly handsome by-the-books law man who doesn&rsquo;t appreciate Peregrine&rsquo;s daring habit of bending the rules.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Law, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-07-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
