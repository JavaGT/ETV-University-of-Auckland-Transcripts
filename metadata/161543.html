About Series:
From Emmy Award winner Dick Wolf comes FBI, a fast-paced drama about the inner workings of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This elite unit brings to bear all their talents, intellect and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and America safe. Born into a multigenerational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell (Missy Peregrym) commits deeply to the people she works with as well as those she protects. Her partner is Special Agent Omar Adom &lsquo;OA&rsquo; Zidan (Zeeko Zaki), a West Point graduate via Bushwick who spent two years undercover for the DEA before being cherry-picked by the FBI. These first-class agents tenaciously  investigate cases of tremendous magnitude, including terrorism, organised crime and counterintelligence.

The series begins with a bomb explosion that devastates a residential apartment building, bringing special agents Maggie Bell and Omar Adom &ldquo;OA&rdquo; Zidan of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate a possible war between rival gangs &ndash; that is, until their prime suspects are discovered brutally murdered.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-04-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
