Etched deeply into the pages of history, Auschwitz conjures up images of death, torture and unimaginable human suffering. At the time of release only 18 minutes of the footage contained within this film had been seen in the west; despite it being used as damning prosecution evidence at the Nuremburg Trials. Recorded from January - February 1945 by a Soviet film crew attached to the 1st Ukrainian Front, the documentary tells the story of the liberation of the Auschwitz camp. Captain Alexander Vorontsov, a member of the camera crew, describes the emotions that he and his comrades felt as they were confronted by the appalling scenes at Hitler's infamous death camp. In the interest of preserving the original character of the material, the footage has been left unedited, emphasising the truly shocking nature of the crimes recorded. 

NB. This film contains scenes of a distressing nature.
