Once these extraordinary places and objects were at the cutting edge of design and construction, but now they stand disused, sometimes contaminated and sometimes dangerous. But who was it that built these mysterious structures? What incredible stories surround them? What secrets do they hold? And why were they abandoned? Seven huge steel boxes rise 80-feet out of the water off the coast of England at the mouth of the River Thames. Now rusting and derelict, The Red Sands Sea Fort was originally built as a first line of defence to deter the Nazi threat to London. Successfully helping the Allies to victory in 1945, the project is one of the most extraordinary engineering successes of World War II. Also in this episode, a sinister-looking deserted Cold War concrete pyramid in North Dakota; a vast empty complex located in the heart of a Philadelphia; and a 4,000-tonne corroding mass of steel, left to rot in a field in Eastern Germany.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>Design, Engineering, Geography, History, Information Technology, Science, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Duke</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-06-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:15:00</td></tr></table>
