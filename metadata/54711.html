But to this day, no film has taken us into the cells of the accused. From January to July 1946, 34-year-old American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn regularly interviewed the accused in the privacy of their cells. He was part of a team assigned to trace the psychological origins of Nazi crimes, the belief of the times being that psychopathic monsters committed them. Every day, he spoke to them at length, reviewing the declarations made by the accused during the hearings. During these interviews, Goldensohn scrupulously noted down what he heard in small notebooks, but the book he had hoped to use them for never materialized. The film is based on these unique historic documents. They provide us with invaluable information for a better understanding of the Nazi regime and the Nuremberg trials.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:42</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, History, Law, Media Studies, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
