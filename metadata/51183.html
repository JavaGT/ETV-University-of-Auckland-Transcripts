He believes the answers lie in the force of gravity. But Newton thought gravity was powered by God, and even Einstein failed to completely solve it. Heading out with his film crew on a road trip across the USA, Brian fires lasers at the moon in Texas, goes mad in the desert in Arizona, encounters the bending of space and time at a maximum security military base, tries to detect ripples in our reality in the swamps of Louisiana and searches for hidden dimensions just outside Chicago.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:57:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Astronomy, History, Mathematics, Physics, Science, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
