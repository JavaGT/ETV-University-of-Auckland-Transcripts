About series:
This stunningly filmed new series explores the work of some of the world&rsquo;s most famous contemporary architects &ndash; from Santiago Calatrava to Sir David Adjaye - and examines how art influences their extraordinary designs. Focusing on one architectural achievement in each episode, this is towering look at some of our greatest modern buildings and restorations and provides privileged access to projects as diverse as the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC, and Battersea Power Station in London. In Dundee we see Kengo Kuma&rsquo;s vision for its new V&amp;A Museum, inspired by cliffs and created as a regenerating force for the city, while in New York we visit two modern masterpieces: Calatrava&rsquo;s World Trade Centre Transportation Hub, with its winged-bird quality and The Vessel, a giant staircase by Thomas Heatherwick, that has become an immediate must-see attraction in the city.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:41:03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Design, Engineering, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-02-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
