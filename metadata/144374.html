He learns that Viking Sagas tell us that the Vikings settled in America at several locations even though only one of these sites has ever been discovered. He sets out on a quest to discover more with Sarah's help. Sarah use satellites 383 miles above the earth to spot ruins as small as 30cms buried beneath the surface.

In the North Atlantic her task is even more challenging as Sarah is unfamiliar with the territory - she's an Egyptologist - and Viking dwellings are usually built from turf; it means looking for turf buried under turf. As Sarah scours the North Atlantic for Lost Viking she knows that the Holy Grail of Viking archaeology is to find another site in North America.

After months of searching using satellites she thinks she is finally on to something in South West Newfoundland, 400 miles further south west than the only other Viking site in America; L'Anse Aux Meadows discovered 55 years ago and now acknowledged as a repair station in the way to the mythical place known as Vinland - the land of the wild vines. As Sarah seeks permission to excavate in Newfoundland she refines her techniques by searching for Viking sites from Britain to America. The quest takes her to Scotland then Iceland. 
About series:
Unravel the mysteries of a great empire.

For 500 years the Vikings forged an empire through ocean exploration and bloody conquest. They survived harsh climates, pushed the boundaries of human exploration and even discovered America 500 years before Columbus. How did they achieve such great successes? And why, at the height of their powers, did they suddenly disappear from many of their territories?

Archaeologist Sarah Parcak travels from the east coast of Scotland to Iceland, Greenland and North America to unlock the secrets of the vast Viking Empire. Combining specialist satellite imagery of archaeological sites with the latest DNA and forensic science, she pieces together the fascinating evidence about this fearless civilisation.

The Vikings Uncovered reveals these intrepid seafarers to be far more sophisticated, vulnerable and more human than their fearless reputation would have us believe</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:03:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Geography, History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
