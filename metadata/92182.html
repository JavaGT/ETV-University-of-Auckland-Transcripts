The Stream examines the future of the independence movement.

Instead of Catalonians voting on independence from Spain on November 9, they will now simply participate in a non-binding symbolic poll. Regional leader Artur Mas watered down the planned referendum after the Spanish government challenged its legality. Now with thousands angered over what&rsquo;s left of the referendum, disharmony in the Catalan leadership is growing. So, what lies ahead for the separatist movement?

The Stream is an aggregator of online sources and discussion, seeking out unheard voices, new perspectives from people on the ground and untold angles related to the most compelling stories of the day.

This is not a show simply about the hottest viral videos or trending stories on the internet. Our goal is to connect with unique, less-covered online communities around the world and share their stories and viewpoints on the news of the day. A key part of The Stream&rsquo;s mission is to help its viewers discover the newest online tools and advice to develop and share their information through these fast-changing networks.

Social networking now offers new possibilities to expand Al Jazeera English&rsquo;s mission to give voice to the voiceless.
