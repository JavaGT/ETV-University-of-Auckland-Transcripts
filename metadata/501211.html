We ask why the US government spent millions on a fleet of war ships in WWI, then deliberately destroyed them. We find out why the ancestor of all modern war ships came to be lying half submerged and forgotten on the far side of the world. We board one of the survivors of the Cold War's underwater game of cat and mouse to find out how it could have caused WWIII.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:51:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>Design, Engineering, Geography, History, Information Technology, Science, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Duke</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:15:00</td></tr></table>
