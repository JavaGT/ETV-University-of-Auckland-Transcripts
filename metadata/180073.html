Honesty, humour and heart are at the centre of this original documentary series, which highlights the outgoing personalities and amazing abilities of seven young adults born with Down syndrome. Hourlong episodes follow the Southern California residents as they pursue passions and dreams, explore friendships and romantic relationships, and generally defy society's expectations. The series also allows the parents to talk about the joy their children bring to their family, and the challenges they face in helping them live as independently as possible. The cast includes avid sportsman and self-professed ladies' man Sean; entertainer John; school employee Cristina; and budding entrepreneur Megan.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:20:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Media Studies, Social Studies, Special Needs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-04-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>07:15:00</td></tr></table>
