They record forest changes resulting from opossum damage to try to learn how to control the pest that's estimated to number 20-40 million throughout New Zealand. Rimutaka Tunnel Ends: The old Fell engines still labour over the Rimutaka incline while below the new tunnel nears completion. Trucks take materials far into the tunnel for mixing and forcing into the great arched steel profile to line the walls with concrete, while at the face the heavy 'mucker-out' scoops back spoil from the last firing. Drillers prepare new shot-holes and charges are fired, opening a jagged hole between the halves of the great tunnel, which will give a new route from Wellington to the Wairarapa and East Coast districts.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:09:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Engineering, History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-10-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:53:13</td></tr></table>
