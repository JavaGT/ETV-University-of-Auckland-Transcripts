Evidence suggests that species thought to be extinct are still very much alive, and wildlife biologist Forrest Galante ventures from the Florida Everglades to remote jungles in a search for the truth. Galante explores actual stories behind these creatures' purported demise and, using evidence like eyewitness accounts and last known photos, tries to prove their existence so he can protect them and help them thrive again. In Zanzibar, Forrest reveals species that have never before been filmed and captures evidence that leads to an unforgettable conclusion. Elsewhere, the investigation takes him to Taiwan for the Formosan clouded leopard, the frozen tundra of Newfoundland for the Newfoundland white wolf, and to the island of Madagascar to look for any trace of the giant Pachylemur.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Ecology & Environment, Geography, Science, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-10-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:30:00</td></tr></table>
