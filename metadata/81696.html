After popular demand, a revamped AKO returns for its third season with i-Pads,  a whole new lesson plan and lots of new faces. Maori language exponent Pania Papa is back to teach and challenge students to take our reo to the next level. As in previous years, each lesson is new and doesnt follow on from former classes. 

Lessons involve listening to top speakers of te reo Maori, working on grammar, learning new sentence structures and much, much more to improve fluency. Games, story writing and composing lyrics ensure the series remains edgy, fun and fresh. At the end of each class, Pania summarises what was learnt to finish off the session.

Please note: there are no worksheets for H?taka 10, 20 ,30 ,40 &amp; 50.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Education & Teaching, Literacy, Maori, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Te Reo</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-05-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
