An ice cream factory. With imagination, tenacity and a few bucks, people have turned the most unlikely places into personal palaces.

Not everyone lives in a two-bedroom, three bath tract house in the suburbs. Some homes are buildings that had their start as something altogether different, such as a car dealership and Victorian water tank. Go inside the homes of innovative homeowners who use creativity and innovative design concepts to turn buildings like a garbage incinerator, an orphanage, and a chapel into charming homes.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Design, Engineering, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:00:00</td></tr></table>
