People have been drinking tea to promote good health for centuries. But a new category of tea that has become ubiquitous on Instagram is raising concerns for its potential adverse side effects.


The Kardashian sisters, Cardi B, Britney Spears and Hilary Duff have all been paid up to six-figure sums to peddle &quot;teatoxes&quot; that claim to effortlessly flatten bellies and kickstart fitness. However, pushback against the promotion of detox teas is growing as the products' claims get more outrageous - including a recent advertisement of a flat belly tea for pregnant women.

Such claims are not verifed by regulators in the United States, where much of the advertising is centred, and citics say the drinks are potentially dangerous to young women who are trying to look as thin and beautiful as the famous people advertising them. This is because the teas contain herbs that induce weight loss through diarrhea and vomiting, which is ineffective and could cause liver failure, health officials say.

Actor Jameela Jamil has been among the most visible opponents of teatox endorsements, issuing scathing critiques of Instagram influencers advertising the products. US Congress members are also starting to take note. In June, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal requested the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigate the sale and marketing of detox teas on social media to &quot;protect consumers from harm&quot;.

The FTC has previously warned more than 90 social media celebrities, athletes and other influencers to &quot;clearly and conspicuously&quot; disclose their relationship to advertisers in promotional posts. But non-profit ad watchdog Truth in Advertising has documented thousands of examples of influencers flouting the disclosure policy, and called for stricter enforcement.

In this episode, The Stream takes a look at claims versus reality and asks whether these products (and others) need regulation. Join the conversation.
