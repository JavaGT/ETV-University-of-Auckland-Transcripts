One summer's work by New Zealand scientists in the Ross Dependency in the Antarctic and the exploration of some of the last unmapped regions. The mysteries of the snow-covered continent are probed by geologists, biologists and physicists at the Scott Base laboratory and on expeditions, possibly among the last to be made with huskies. H.M.N.Z.S. Endeavour brings supplies from Wellington, while ice- breakers of the United States Navy cut a passage for her through the pack ice to McMurdo Sound. Made in wide-screen format and colour, this is possibly the most notable piece of cinema to come from the Antarctic. Duration 35 minutes.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:33:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-08-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:34:32</td></tr></table>
