With David Boies and Ted Olson at the legal helm, the fight to bring the results of Prop 8 to the US Supreme Court first has to be fought in a front of a judge at a California District Court. If that fight is lost, their journey ends in failure. If that fight is won and is successful in the US Supreme Court, it would mean civil liberties for the LGBT community in all fifty states, and not just California. 

About the Series:
The epic mini-series of 2017 is When We Rise! Chart the personal and political struggles of the birth of the LGBT movement.

A dramatization of the real life San Francisco centered fight for LGBT rights from 1972 to 2015 is presented, the LGBT community which arguably has had the most numerous organized campaigns against them of any minority group to suppress those rights in the United States during that time period. It focuses on the advocacy and other supportive work of four individuals, Cleve Jones, Roma Guy, Diane Jones and Ken Jones, whose experiences focus on different aspects of the issue. Cleve's story focuses primarily on the political and legislative fight for gay and ultimately LGBT rights. Roma's story focuses primarily on her fight for women's rights, especially safe places for women, within that where she as a lesbian fits, ultimately a fight for universal health care in San Francisco, and her personal relationships particularly with Diane. Beyond that relationship with Roma, Diane's story focuses on her work as a nurse in caring for AIDS patients, and her want as a lesbian to have a child.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:41:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, Psychology, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-03-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:00:00</td></tr></table>
