About series:
Can an awkward but talented hitman who wants to act balance both worlds?

Saturday Night Live alumni Bill Hader stars as a depressed, low-rent hitman from the Midwest who falls in love with acting while on a job in LA.

Barry&rsquo;s handler, Fuches, hires him out to the violent Chechen mob in Los Angeles, led by Goran Pazar and his right-hand man, Noho Hank. Barry&rsquo;s target: an aspiring actor who is having an affair with Pazar&rsquo;s wife. Barry follows his &ldquo;mark&rdquo; into an acting class taught by beloved teacher/guru Gene Cousineau and is instantly drawn to the group of students, particularly Sally. Although he wants to start a new life in this community of eager hopefuls, Barry&rsquo;s criminal past won&rsquo;t let him walk away.
