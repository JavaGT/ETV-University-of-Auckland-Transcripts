Although the Italian government had surrendered shortly after the Allied invasion in September 1943, the war in their homeland was far from over. Their former German allies quickly occupied most of the peninsula and would defend it vigorously for the next 18 months.

Military historian Dr Monty Soutar takes us over the battlefields on which New Zealand soldiers fought and fell in WWII, with a focus on the battle for Monte Cassino.
