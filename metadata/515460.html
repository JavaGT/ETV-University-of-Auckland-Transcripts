Alex was the skinniest dog the Christchurch SPCA staff had ever seen when they picked him up &mdash; and he was hanging on by a thread.

'Any day's the perfect day for a chat' - mental health worker celebrated
His old hand-painted Toyota is rough. The trailer that it tows is rough, and his signs that ask &quot;You OK Bro?&quot; are equally rough.

Award winning Neo-Soul artist Mohi Allen is back with his mellifluous sound with the release of his highly anticipated bilingual album 'Elements of Aroha'

Scotty Harvey wants nothing more from us than a meaningful chat. The social worker, his multicoloured car and signs that ask &quot;You Okay Bro?&quot;, have become a common sight around Tauranga. Parked up on roadsides, he invites people to stop for a yarn to see if they might need some support. And for those hours and hours of voluntary dedication, he's this week's ASB Good As Gold recipient.

When the SPCA found him, &quot;Alex&quot; the mixed-breed dog was just 18 kilograms and barely alive. He couldn't lift his head or move his body, but still... he laboriously thumped his tail. Three months later - thanks to all the best care and love - he's a new dog. Rachel Parkin went to meet Alex to help find his forever home.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand, News, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-11-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
