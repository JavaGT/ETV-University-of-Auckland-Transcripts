Beatlemania heralded a golden era for bands; teens wanted to dance and venues sprung up in every Kiwi city. This episode includes gritty R&amp;B influenced groups like Larry's Rebels, The La De Das and Christchurch's Chants R&amp;B. Prime time TV music show  C'Mon was hugely influential and became a launchpad for Kiwi acts like Shane, Mr Lee Grant and The Chicks. Songwriter Wayne Mason shares the creation story behind The Fourmyula's 1969 hit 'Nature'.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:43:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, Music, New Zealand, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-12-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:16:00</td></tr></table>
