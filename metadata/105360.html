About Series 2:
Gripping psychological thriller Penny Dreadful returns for a shadowy second season in which the hunters - some of literature&rsquo;s most famously terrifying characters &ndash; become the hunted. The series weaves together classic horror origin stories as the characters continue to grapple with their monstrous alienation.

Vanessa Ives and Ethan Chandler are forming a deeper bond as the group, including Sir Malcolm, Dr. Frankenstein, and Sembene, unite to banish the evil forces that threaten to destroy them. Meanwhile, Dorian Gray, the Creature and Brona are all waging battles of their own, while Evelyn Poole (a.k.a. Madame Kali), the seductive spiritualist, returns to pose a unique threat to the group.
