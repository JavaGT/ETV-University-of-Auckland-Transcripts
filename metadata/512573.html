Through this series of four short documentaries, &lsquo;Te Waiora&rsquo; aims to showcase these individuals, educators and passionate advocates of the transformative power of the water.

Surfers Maioha Kelly and Jordan Waiti have been working with rangatahi across Aotearoa to deliver surf lessons, using m훮taraunga M훮ori to strengthen and deepen their connection to Tangaroa.

Based in surfing hotspot Raglan, they have been working with Hamilton teacher Lovey Chapman to provide lessons to rangatahi. Despite their earliest ancestors having ridden waves, the cost and access to surfing lessons has prohibited many rangatahi from being able to learn to surf.

Forming Aotearoa Water Patrol, Waiti and Kelly are passionate about removing these barriers and providing the skills needed to ensure safety on the water, whilst emphasising the cultural significance surfing can provide for young M훮ori.
