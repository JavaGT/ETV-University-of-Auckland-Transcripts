Crash Course World History #8</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Introduction to the life and accomplishments of Alexander the Great, his empire, his horse Bucephalus, the empires that came after him, and the idea of Greatness. Is greatness a question of accomplishment, of impact, or are people great because the rest of us decide they're great? Also discussed are gender bias in history, Catherine the Great's death, the ardent love other generals - from Pompey the Great to Napoleon - had for Alexander, a bit of Persian history.
