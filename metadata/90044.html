Will Yemen's new peace deal last? - The Stream examines how Yemenis view the peace agreement between the government and Houthi rebels.

After weeks of protests and deadly clashes in Yemen, Houthi rebels and the government have agreed to a UN-brokered peace deal calling for the formation of a new government within a month. Stipulations include the drafting of a new constitution on the basis of consensus and restoration of recently cut fuel subsidies. While most Yemenis are celebrating the peace agreement, there&rsquo;s concern about whether or not it will be honoured. So, will this deal last?
