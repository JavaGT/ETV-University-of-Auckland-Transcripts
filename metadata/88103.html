Utopia is Pilger's investigation into Australia's colonial past and wealthy present.  It sets out to break the stereotypes of the first people of Australia.  Pilger travels to Darwin, then to Western Australia and to the outback of New SouthWales, where he explores the high rate of Indigenous people imprisoned, the low average life expectancy, and the prevalence of preventable diseases and malnutrition among indigenous communities.  Utopia is both a personal journey and a universal story of power and resistance, of how modern societies can be divided between those who conform and the dystopian world of those who do not.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:01:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Ecology & Environment, History, Law, Political Studies, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-09-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
