But in her new book, &quot;The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain,&quot; Paul suggests there are ways we can unlock additional intelligence. 
 
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re never explicitly taught to think outside the brain; we&rsquo;re not shown how to employ our bodies and spaces and relationships in the service of intelligent thought,&rdquo; writes Paul.
 
Throughout the book, she attempts to demonstrate that intelligence isn&rsquo;t found just in the brain and that by identifying additional sources of intelligence we can unlock greater insight.
 
In this episode of The Stream, we sit down with Paul to discuss how engaging with our environment, our bodies, and our peers could make us smarter.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-08-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
