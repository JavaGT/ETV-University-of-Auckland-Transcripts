Popular AI image generators are able to produce seemingly endless amounts of stunning visual art in just a matter of seconds. So where does the technology leave professional artists?

Earlier this year, a group of artists and illustrators filed a class action lawsuit that claims the generative AI tools Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DreamUp violate US copyright law by repurposing artists&rsquo; work found on the open web.

AI image generators are trained on datasets made up of billions of images collected online and generally without the artists&rsquo; knowledge or approval. Users can then prompt the AI to create new artwork in the style of a specific artist. For many digital artists, the technology represents a threat to their livelihoods. Yet others see AI as a powerful new medium that can be used for artistic expression.

In this episode of The Stream, we&rsquo;ll look at how artificial intelligence is disrupting creative work and getting people to re-examine how we think about art.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-05-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
