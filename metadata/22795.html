The Brazilian economy is still expanding, but what can Brits sell them that they haven't already got? Theo travels to Brazil's business hub, Sao Paulo, to Bauru (in the heart of sugar cane country) and to the glamorous Rio De Janeiro to chart the fortunes of three British companies with very different aims and ambitions. There's Sleek Make Up, an East London company specialising in cosmetics for darker-skinned women. Dreamaid, a website aimed at helping the world's poorer artists sell their wares to richer customers around the world, and Cadbury trying to enter the Brazilian chocolate market, one of the fastest-growing in the world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-05-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:10:00</td></tr></table>
