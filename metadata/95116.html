In 1918, defeat in the Great War broke up the empires that had controlled much of East and Southeast Europe in the nineteenth century. Deciding how to put the pieces together has been a key challenge faced by Europe ever since, and is still a prevalent issue in Ukraine today. How do you create a viable, strong state that still does justice to a variety of ethnic minority groups living within it? I explore that issue through the prism of the old Habsburg Empire and, in particular, the story of Czechoslovakia, one of the new states invented in the aftermath of war.

By way of comparison, I also explore the theme through the story of the United Kingdom. I believe that the questions we face today &ndash; Scotland, the nature of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and its relationship with the South &ndash; have their roots in the period just before the Great War and in the fallout from the conflict, particularly 1916 in Ireland.

We tend to think that these issues have come to the surface in recent times &ndash; the troubles in Northern Ireland, for instance, or the SNP demand for a referendum on independence. In this series, I want to emphasise the importance of taking a long view of history, as well as the usefulness of viewing our island&rsquo;s story by contrast to that of other countries.

Kipling once asked &lsquo;what do they know of England who only England know?&rsquo; The same question may be posed of all the countries of the United Kingdom, especially at a time of sharper national consciousness in the wake of the Scottish Referendum. This series is a journey into comparative history, which took me and the team to 10 countries and across a century of turmoil as we traced the &lsquo;Long Shadow&rsquo; of the Great War and its legacies.

About the series:
Marking the centenary of World War One, historian David Reynolds explores the conflict&rsquo;s enduring impact - the shadow it has cast over Britain and Europe in the century that followed.
Travelling to locations across Europe - from Slovenia to the Sudetenland and from Belfast to Berlin, David Reynolds traces the war&rsquo;s legacy for war and peace, people and politics, empire and identity, arguing that it unleashed forces we still grapple with today.

We will take a look at how the experience of war haunted the generation who lived through it and, in particular the soldiers, who survived it. We&rsquo;ll hear of characters such as Benito Mussolini, Eamon de Valera, Philippe Petain, James Ramsay MacDonald and Tomas Masaryk. David Reynolds will examine how these men shaped the peace that followed war, often in unpredictable ways.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Political Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-12-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
