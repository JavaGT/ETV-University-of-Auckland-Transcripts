Shortly before 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT), in a televised address, President Putin announced that his country was launching a &quot;special military operation&quot; in eastern Ukraine to protect the people of DPR and LPR.

&quot;I decided to conduct a special military operation. Its goal is the protection of people who, during eight years, suffer abuse and genocide from Kyiv regime. To this end, we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation, &quot; he said.

Europe would then wake up to what would be the largest, most protracted military offensive in the continent since World War II.

Russian ground forces invaded from four main fronts in the north, northeast, east and south, while artillery and missiles targeted numerous locations.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PG</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-02-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:30:00</td></tr></table>
