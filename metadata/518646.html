It&rsquo;s a national day of remembrance that commemorates all Australians and New Zealanders who served and died in wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations.

The date was chosen to mark the anniversary of the first campaign in Gallipoli, Turkey, which led to significant casualties for Australian and New Zealand forces during the First World War. The acronym ANZAC stands for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, whose soldiers became known as Anzacs. Anzac Day has become a sacred day for many and remains one of the most important national occasions for both Australia and New Zealand.
