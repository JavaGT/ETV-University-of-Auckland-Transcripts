About the Series:
Jamali Maddix and three comedian friends, Fern Brady, Alfie Brown and Sean McLoughlin, travel Europe to find out if anybody outside Britain actually cares about the country's decision to leave the EU.

Gigging and exploring in four major cities, the quartet take in Dublin, Amsterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen.

Each episode of the four-part series is centred around one comedian and their respective relationship with that city. The group sample the weird and well-known delights of each city, befriending some locals, before performing a live, stand-up gig.

Attracted by its liberal attitudes, Maddix takes Brady on her first trip to Amsterdam to visit a coffee shop and take a spin around Vondelpark on a tandem; frequently voted the &quot;happiest place to live&quot;, Alfie Brown explores Copenhagen's strong sense of community with Maddix; Brady and Brown explore the unofficial European &quot;Capital Of Cool&quot;, Berlin; and Brady joins Sean McLoughlin to explore his heritage in Dublin.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:23:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VICELAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
