This video discusses a key inconvenient truth regarding mainstream visions of a circular economy: the fact that circularity means more than just technological innovations for material and industrial efficiency. In order to bring about a truly fair, democratic, and sustainable ecological transition the circular economy must also mean circulating wealth, power and knowledge in fundamentally redistributive manners. This entails a radical transformation of our entire societal system towards conviviality, solidarity, social justice, care and harmony with nature and beyond the current growth-dependent neo-liberal economy, which necessitates the continuous exploitation of people and nature to survive. 
In this video, we dive into the discourses on circular economy and present the research of Martin Calisto Friant, PhD candidate, focussing on the transformative approach which many researchers now call a circular society as opposed to simply a circular economy.
