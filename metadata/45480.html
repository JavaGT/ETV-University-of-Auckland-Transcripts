And Tony will reveal the real story behind the modern Olympic movement. In this documentary Olympics venues are time machines. Tony travels back through the ages to discover life as it was in Bronze and Iron Age Britain. So what gives the Olympic Games such seemingly magical powers? To find out, Tony embarks on a quest, interweaving the history of his family and their hometown with the extraordinary 3000-year-old story of the Olympic Games. At times, the two histories couldn't be more different, but in the 19th century they dramatically converge.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:01:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Architecture, History, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-07-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>06:30:00</td></tr></table>
