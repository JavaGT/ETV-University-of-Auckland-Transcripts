After a stripped back walk to work (The Commute: walking 90km to work), I decided to continue experimenting between the lands and seas of home and work. This time by paddling. At least, that was the plan; following two rivers, a canal, the sea, and a creek- all the way to my desk. What usually takes 75 minutes by car took four full days of mostly dragging, burning over 18,000 calories. Sleeping by the river, under a train line and next to a boat ramp, the final drag through the suburbs was a full watershed transect, which is an intimate view into all the goods and bads of humanity- including myself. What was another commuting stunt turned out to be the hardest, most insightful four days of travel I&rsquo;ve ever done.
