The West Australian Symphony Orchestra presents the world premiere documentary feature, Harmony &ndash; the missing 8th.
Filmed over three years, the documentary follows WASO&rsquo;s 2016 journey to China to perform in Beijing and Shanghai and the ambitious plan to perform Mahler&rsquo;s 8th in Perth.

With multiple stakeholders involved, the plans to tour sit on a knife&rsquo;s edge for the orchestra. However, as the event approaches stakeholder support begins to fade, and the road to China becomes more tumultuous than ever.

Harmony &ndash; the missing 8th offers a rare fly-on-the-wall view of the boardrooms, green rooms, global concert halls and among the orchestra, depicting the triumph in making it to China and the battle it took to get there</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:20:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Documentary, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Asian Studies, Business, Careers, Chinese, History, Media Studies, Music, Social Studies, Sociology, Travel & Tourism, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:25:00</td></tr></table>
