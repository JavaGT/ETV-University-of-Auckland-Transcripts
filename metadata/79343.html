The making of Vogue magazine. Audrey Withers, Vogue Editor in 1946, invited British Path&eacute; into her offices to learn how the world's most famous fashion magazine was made. We see a photo shoot with photographer Clifford Coffin, fashion-turned-war reporter Lee Miller, and leading fashion artist and illustrator Carl Erikson. The whole process is shown, from feature planning at editorial meetings all the way through to guillotining the final pages at the printers.
