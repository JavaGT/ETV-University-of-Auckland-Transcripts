From maintenance staff to baggage handlers, the staff behind the scenes at Leeds Bradford Airport share their stories with the public who usually never get to meet them. With diverse and challenging work days including emergency landings, long delays and toilet malfunctions, these staff are the everyday heroes who get passengers on and off flights as smoothly, quickly and safely as possible through both dedication and humour. These staff are also crucial as Leeds Bradford tries to reinvent itself as Britain's most successful regional airport, aiming to hit 7 million passengers per year by 2030.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Careers, Social Studies, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-07-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
