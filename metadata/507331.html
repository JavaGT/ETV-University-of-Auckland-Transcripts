As subjects of stories and interview sources, women are far less likely to be interviewed as experts and only appear in about a quarter of television, radio, print and online news, according to the Global Media Monitoring Project.

Because of gender bias, women are less likely to be thought of as authoritative experts in certain fields, including science and economics. In an analysis of COVID-19 pandemic coverage by major news sources in the US, UK and Australia, women were quoted only a third of the time and in a quarter of all interviews in the area of public health and epidemiology.

Not including women&rsquo;s voices reinforces stereotypes and denies women the opportunity to be recognised for their knowledge and expertise. Media advocates say more inclusive news coverage could be achieved with proactive approaches in using female interview sources and in hiring more women to build diverse newsrooms that better reflect society.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-01-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
