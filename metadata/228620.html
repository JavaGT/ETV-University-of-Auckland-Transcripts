Legendary Brit band Depeche Mode release 'One Night In Paris' The Exciter Tour 200l A Live Concert Film by Anton Corbijn as a high quality, highly collectable two disc DVD on May 27th on Mute. The two hour live concert was filmed at the Palais Omnisport, Paris Bercy in front of 16,000 as part of the band's massive 2001 Exciter Tour.

Directed by the band's long time artistic collaborator, Anton Corbijn, the cutting-edge Paris show was shot on anamorphic 16:9 Digital Betacam using 13 cameras to achieve the ultimate illustration of the band's striking performance. Anton received a Grammy nomination in 1994 for the &quot;Devotional&quot; concert film.

&quot;Anton always comes to everything with a very unique perspective,&quot; says Martin Gore. &quot;He always manages to capture the spirit of the band better than other people. Because we have had a relationship with him that has lasted so long, there is an element of feeling at ease with each other.&quot; Of the 19 song set, the many highlights include rousing renditions of new and old classics from 'Walking In My Shoes' and 'Personal Jesus' to 'Dream On' and 'Freelove'. Martin Gore showcases his poignant lead vocals on 'Home' and 'Breathe'.

&quot;We couldn't have gone out and done another tour celebrating our past,&quot; says Dave Gahan. &quot;It had to be something new. There aren't many bands that can actually say after 20 years that they're trying to be creative.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:57:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Documentary, Entertainment, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Anthropology, Business, Careers, Design, English, History, Leadership, Literature, Media Studies, Music, Sociology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-03-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
