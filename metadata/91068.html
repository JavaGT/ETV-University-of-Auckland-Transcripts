The rapid removal and processing of dung by introducing dung beetles can result in many benefits. Sheep, cattle, horses, deer, goats and other domesticated livestock have been brought to New Zealand without the associated dung beetles that have evolved to process their dung. Intensive farming means large amounts of dung are continually being dropped onto the pasture surface. It has been estimated that pasture covered by cattle dung each day results in a daily loss of 570 &ndash; 950 hectares of grazing forage area. Depending on the time of year and climate, it may take dung pats weeks to months to break down and the adverse effects extend beyond the cowpat. A dung patch affects a grazing area five times its own area. Sheep and cattle reject pasture forage growing near animal dung, a response to the offensive properties of the dung itself. This is referred to as the zone of repugnance and it&rsquo;s what some farmers try to offset by break feeding, a practice that increases livestock contact with diseases associated with dung.

Duck Eggs for the Auckland Market from Hill Foot Farms
Peter and Katie Mitchell produce duck eggs from their base near Warkworth, selling to Asian markets, the food service sector and individual buyers in the greater Auckland area. They farm around 1,500 Pekin ducks that produce 700&ndash;800 eggs each day in winter, rising to peak production of 1,200 eggs a day in the summer months. The Mitchells are involved in the &ldquo;WOOFER&rdquo; scheme and occasionally have &ldquo;willing workers&rdquo; on the property to help around the farm.

Lessons from Thirty Years of Biodynamic Farming
Thirty years of organic farming has made Shelly Beach Farm a beacon of chemical free farm practice and a magnet for students from all over the world. When John Pearce and his wife Norrie came back from the United States in 1973, they looked around for a 10-acre block so they could grow some of their own food. Instead, they discovered a rundown 200ha coastal block on the western shores of the Kaipara Harbour for about the same price as smaller blocks nearer the city. It had no fences, no water and the only barriers to the wind whistling down from Dargaville were weeds and shoulder-high thistles.
