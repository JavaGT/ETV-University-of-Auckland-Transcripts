About the series:
Sesame Street is built around a comprehensive, whole child curriculum created by in-house child psychologists and educators. Every segment, every song, and every story is designed to educate young viewers about a specific lesson - and every year the curriculum focus changes to address the current educational needs of children.

Sesame Street encourages children to:
Take beginning steps toward reading, writing, mathematics and science.
Appreciate cultural diversity by modeling people who differ in appearance, action, or point of view playing together, working together, making friends, and resolving conflicts.
Appreciate the arts in a variety of forms including visual art, music, and dance and create their own art as they develop the concept, &quot;I am an artist.&quot;
Learn about the body and how to keep it healthy and safe.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children, Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Education & Teaching</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOUR</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-10-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
