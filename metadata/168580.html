About series:
There's no such thing as &quot;a regular day&quot; at Denver's Planned Pethood Plus veterinary clinic. For 80,000-plus clients and their pets, the clinic and its maverick vet Dr. Jeff Young represent one last hope and possibly the difference between life and death. This season of Dr Jeff: Rocky Mountain Vet follows Dr. Jeff and his team as they save a puppy from a deadly virus, help an ailing member in a wolf pack, look after an injured alligator, and more. Puppies and kittens win hearts at the clinic, but even the scaly and &ndash; seemingly scary &ndash; animals get the help they need with Dr Jeff and his team.
