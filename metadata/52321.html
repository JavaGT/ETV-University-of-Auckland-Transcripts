Buzzy Bee, a wooden wheeled character, is the hero but for no other reason than he has an infectious positive attitude and a wonderfully generous manner with his friends. 

Oh, he can fly, but not that well, and he's pretty bad at landing! 

They all live in Rolling Downs, which is a little town made also of wood, linked by brightly coloured roads and bridges, just perfect for our wheeled characters to roll about on. 

The stories revolve around the delightful calamities that Buzzy Bee, with his happy and positive outlook resolves with aplomb. 

A gentle and colourful show, the episodes from Buzzy Bee focus on a group of characters and their troublesome and triumphant adventures. 

The episodes feature situations that will be both familiar and exciting to small children and include some lovely twists of logic and fun.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:50</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-03-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:00:00</td></tr></table>
