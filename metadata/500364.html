Our technology relies more and more on space-based systems for communication which can be disrupted by &quot;space weather&quot;. For example, solar flares, the largest explosions in the solar system, produce ozone depletions several days later when the particles from the explosion arrive at the Earth and rain down into the atmosphere. We are also studying the global distribution of world lightning activity. Not only because lightning is part of the Earth's weather - it also drives space weather conditions as well. Radio pulses from lightning can control the population of high energy electrons trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Craig Rodger - senior lecturer in Physics at the University of Otago.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Astronomy, Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
