They have been defeated after a five-month battle but many are saying this is just the beginning.

In May, the city of Marawi in the southern Philippines was overrun by an alliance of armed groups who had pledged allegiance to ISIL. It was a daring assault that left the country in shock.

Now, after a ruinous five-month fight, the group has been defeated. But Marawi - the biggest Muslim city in the country - is almost completely destroyed and more than 1,000 people are dead.
 
Al Jazeera 101 East&rsquo;s Steve Chao was with the military as it made its final push to take the city. With some saying the battle may be the beginning of a wider conflict on the island of Mindanao, he will share stories from the front lines with The Stream.
 
Chao is joined by local experts to ask what&rsquo;s next for the Philippines and whether ISIL is gearing up for another assault and planning on making Southeast Asia its new battleground.
