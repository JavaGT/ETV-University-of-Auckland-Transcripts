This documentary follows William Hastings Burke, an Australian, whose fascination with G&ouml;ring&rsquo;s life and quest for the truth about his acts of resistance and subsequent research was laid out in the book, 'Thirty Four', published in 2009. The book&rsquo;s title is a reference to the 34 names on Albert G&ouml;ring&rsquo;s list of people he helped that he presented as witnesses during his trial at Nuremberg. Ironically and sadly, considering his exploits, the allies brought Albert before the military tribunals at the Nuremberg trials for war crimes merely because he was the brother of Hermann G&ouml;ring.

His accusers refused to believe his tales of resistance until after 14 months imprisonment he was appointed a new interrogator, Major Victor Parker. In what was a very fortunate coincidence, Parker was the nephew of Sophie Paschkis, the wife of the composer Franz Leh&aacute;r, who Albert had saved and whose name was among the thirty-four. Despite his eventual exoneration, Albert G&ouml;ring continued to suffer for his association with the G&ouml;ring family name and its Nazi connections and this thoughtful and absorbing documentary and his life do not have the happy endings they deserved.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:57:44</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, German, History, Law, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
