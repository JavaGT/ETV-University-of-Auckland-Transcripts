But this Christmas, the girls put just one thing on their wish lists&mdash;to spend Christmas with both Mom and Dad at Tracie&rsquo;s family farmhouse. It will prove to be a difficult trip for Tracie: she&rsquo;ll have to listen as her siblings flaunt their perfect lives, and endure her mother&rsquo;s mission to protect her daughter by pointing out all Rick&rsquo;s faults and shortcomings. But at the end of the day, perhaps this Christmas gathering can help rekindle the lost romance between Tracie and Rick, and make their daughters&rsquo; greatest wish come true.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:58:35</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-12-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:00:00</td></tr></table>
