Stevens is so dedicated that he forgoes visiting his father on his deathbed in order to serve, and overlooks Darlington's Nazi sympathies and growing anti-Semitism. Twenty years after his employer's death, Stevens tries to reconnect with Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), Darlington's head housekeeper, and begins to regret his loyalty to his former master.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:19:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Drama, Literature, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-09-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
