About the Series:
At once deeply observed and intriguingly elusive, provocative new Showtime drama The Affair explores the emotional and psychological effects of an extramarital relationship.

Told separately from the male and female perspectives, the absorbing narrative uses distinct memory biases to both misdirect and intrigue. When Alison (Ruth Wilson), a young woman waiting tables at a popular Hamptons diner, meets Noah (Dominic West), a dissolute schoolteacher and novelist resentfully spending the summer at his in-laws&rsquo; estate, they fall into a dalliance with far-reaching repercussions. Alison&rsquo;s husband Cole (Joshua Jackson) is struggling to keep it all together in the wake of tragedy, and with the financially-strained ranch that has been in his family for generations. Their emotionally-charged marriage becomes even more complicated as Alison&rsquo;s affair with Noah escalates, in turn casting a shadow over Noah&rsquo;s marriage to Helen (Maura Tierney), his college sweetheart, best friend, mother of his children, lover and wife of 17 years.

Starring Dominic West (The Wire), Ruth Wilson (Luther), Maura Tierney (ER), Joshua Jackson (Fringe), Julia Goldani Telles (Bunheads), Danny Fischer (The Following), Nicolette Robinson(Hart of Dixie), and Darren Goldstein (Damages).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-01-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:30:00</td></tr></table>
