Bruce Rollinson is a late-comer to working on the land - but now he's taken the plunge, he's committed himself totally. Bruce and his wife Steph moved to Ohakune as young university graduates to take on professional jobs - Bruce in marketing, Steph as an adviser for a fertilizer company. But when they needed a new challenge, they bought a big vegetable growing operation, which features on this week's Country Calendar. The Rollinsons were going against a trend. Nearly three-quarters of Ohakune's market gardeners have sold up in the last 20 years and less than a dozen are now left. Bruce soon found himself representing growers' interests in a conflict with the local district council over irrigation during last summer's dry spell. He negotiated an agreement that worked for all parties - but the experience made him think about the environmental and economic challenges that farmers face and how they can respond to a changing and sometimes unsympathetic world. As a result, he applied for the Kellogg programme - a year-long course that identifies and encourages future agriculture industry leaders.About 20 participants attend seminars at Lincoln University and complete a demanding series of home-based assignments. It's funded by the New Zealand Primary Industry Council and more than 500 people have graduated since it started 30 years ago.The course put Bruce under pressure because it meant spending less time on the farm, but he says the experience was well worth it and has increased his commitment to the land.  Although Ohakune is known as the carrot capital, Bruce and Steph don't grow them. They have just two crops on their 40 hectares - parsnips and Brussels sprouts, both of which are sold throughout the North Island. They say specialisation has allowed them to cut costs and maintain quality - and succeeding in a land-based industry means always trying to stay one step ahead.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Business, Economics, Food Science, Geography, New Zealand, Science, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-03-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
