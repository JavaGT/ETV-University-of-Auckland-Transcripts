When the series is complete, they'll all fit together to make one giant, beautiful poster.

John Green explores how Spain went from being a middling European power to one of the most powerful empires on Earth, thanks to their plunder of the New World in the 16th and 17th centuries. Learn how Spain managed to destroy the two biggest pre-Columbian civilizations, mine a mountain made of silver, mishandle their economy, and lose it all by the mid-1700s. Come along for the roller coaster ride with Charles I (he was also Charles V), Philip II, Atahualpa, Moctezuma, Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, and Francisco Pizarro as Spain rises and falls, and takes two empires and China down with them.
