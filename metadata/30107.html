Upon realising many people in her life had lied to her and helped to create her new identity of Beth because they despised Tara so much, Beth decided to keep her new kinder persona of Beth, but to return to her real family - her mother, Mrs Jay, her half-brother, James and half-sister, Lilli. Beth is trying to adjust to her new life with the Jays, whilst feeling conflicted about her old identity. She has so many questions that need answering: Why was she so nasty when she was Tara? Will this nasty side of her ever return? And what has happened to her father?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:00:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-03-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:00:00</td></tr></table>
