However everything in Pontyberry is overshadowed by the death of local Rugby legend Dick the Kick. This proves to be a boon for Paula and her father, whose business is ailing when they are charged to organize a celebrity funeral with orations from the likes of Neil Kinnock and a whole bunch of famous pall-bearers. And once more, when things look like going wrong Sean proves his worth.

About the Series:
Stella is a British comedy-drama created and written by Ruth Jones who plays the lead role of Stella. The series is set in the fictional village of Pontyberry in the South Wales Valleys. Stella is a 40-something single mum who earns a living doing the locals' ironing. Most of the time, she's relatively happy with life as she juggles the ups and downs of her family, amid the chaos of her eccentric friends, relatives and children's fathers. Her brood consists of eldest son Luke, who starts the series in prison as a consequence of stealing five cars and a lorry; 16-year-old Emma who's smitten with her first love Sunil; and 12-year-old Ben.

Then there's Stella's best friend, sister-in-law Paula, a functioning alcoholic funeral director. Stella's not-too-bright ex-husband Karl who's now seeing 28-year-old Nadine; not forgetting lollipop man and youth rugby coach Alan, an old school friend of Stella's who's been in love with her since 1984. Finally there's Stella's brother Dai who is an ex-serviceman injured on duty. He doesn't work now but is always willing to help out while enjoying an exciting sex life with his wife Paula.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
