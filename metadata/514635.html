But can we do it? We asked former All Black Jeff Wilson for his thoughts.

A fat pet might look cute but it&rsquo;s really not good for their health.
So how do you persuade your furry friend to go on a diet? 

With election day tomorrow and the All Blacks playing Sunday, we asked people on the street: 
Who would you rather see win? Your favourite political team, or rugby team?

Word on the street is we are more politically divided than ever these days. 
So what if the politics of your significant other is very much in opposition to yours? We met the couple who have made it work.

Next week we want to see the best miniature...anything!
Show us a small version of something - a tiny horse, a little chair, a train - and you could win $400 of Lego to build your own mini world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:32:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, Magazine, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-10-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
