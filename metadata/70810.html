Two weeks ago a woman helped a stranger in need.
Vee Rutledge called 111 and was put through to St John Ambulance.
She needed assistance with an elderly man who had fallen from his mobility scooter while returning to Ranfurly rest home in Auckland.
That should have been the end of the matter - except it wasn't.
Somehow the private details she gave to the emergency service were passed on to a third party and that left her feeling very uncomfortable.

Tourist projects at war over road.
Two large scale tourist projects in the Fiordland/Southland area are clashing over the use of the same 37 kilometres of road.
The $8 million Round the Mountain cycle trail uses the same back country road as a proposed convoy of buses to take tourists to a planned monorail.
Conservation Minister Nick Smith will announce his decision on whether the monorail will be built early next year.
Because the cycle trail is part of the Prime Minister's national cycle trail - John Key's own idea - locals are calling for him to come down south and sort it out.

Is eating fish 'n' chips at an aquarium OK?
New Zealand is a nation that loves the sea - and all things from it.
But the National Aquarium in Napier has found itself accused of supporting animal cruelty.
Not to the fish in the tanks, but the ones being served in the aquarium cafe.
That's right - the Fish Bowl Cafe serves fish and chips.
And animal rights group PETA says that's inappropriate for a place like an aquarium which is supposed to educate and inform about marine environments.

Wearing second-hand clothes for a year.
If you grew up as a child with older brothers or sisters then at some point - whether you wanted to or not - you were probably forced to wear hand-me-down clothes.
But one Auckland teenager has taken that a step further.
She's deliberately wearing second-hand clothing for an entire year.
Anna Burns-Francis joined her on an op-shopping trip to find out why.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-12-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
