New Zealand meets the world: Delivering a national opportunity

Martin Sneddan, CEO, Duco Promotions

Martin Snedden is currently a director of both New Zealand Cricket and the International Cricket Council, and also of Auckland World Master Games 2017, the entity charged with creating and delivering an event of significant sporting and economic importance for Auckland.
Martin has recently retired from the role of CEO of the Tourism Industry Association, in the course of which he led the tourism industry through the creation of &lsquo;Tourism 2025&rsquo;, a strategy to provide New Zealand&rsquo;s number 2-ranked export earning industry with a confident sense of strategic direction through the next decade.

Between 2007 and 2011, he was CEO of Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd, the company responsible for staging the extremely successful Rugby World Cup 2011. The book he has written about this experience, &ldquo;A Stadium of Four Million&rdquo;, was released in September 2012.

Between 2001 and 2007, Martin headed New Zealand Cricket during a tumultuous period punctuated by issues relating to terrorism, politics and player contract negotiations, a period where the BLACKCAPS (New Zealand cricket team) consistently ranked high in both tests and one day internationals. He led the successful joint New Zealand Cricket / Cricket Australia bid for the rights to host Cricket World Cup 2015.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:47:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>09:35:04</td></tr></table>
