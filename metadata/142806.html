Cadbury owner, Mondelez International, plans to close the factory early next year and move production to Australia as part of a global move to cut US$3 billion (NZ$4.2 billion) in costs. 

Cadbury World will expand into the adjoining confectionary factory after it closes, making the attraction six times its current size.

She said she is &quot;gobsmacked&quot; that the footage wasn't shown to the families and that it &quot;reeks&quot; of a cover-up.
