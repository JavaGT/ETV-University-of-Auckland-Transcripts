ACC has ruled a wheelchair-bound parent can not have the chair that would let him be more involved with his children. All he wants is to push his kids on a swing and to go to the park or to the beach without his chair getting stuck.

Worthy Redeemed victim speaks out
Thirty-nine-year-old Worthy Redeemed was found guilty on three charges of manslaughter, one count of causing grievous bodily harm with reckless disregard. His name implies conviction and consideration, yet the only conviction evident from the man named Worthy Redeemed today was the one that earned him 14 years in jail. He grabbed the steering wheel of a car and sent it head on into a bus, taking the lives of three young people. The victims' friend and only innocent survivor told his story to Michael Holland.

But for a quintet of brass players, performing the festival just wasn't enough. They wanted to get among the people and see for themselves the tsunami damage. Lisa Davies followed them on their trip from Tokyo to Sendai.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:32:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Health, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-10-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:58:00</td></tr></table>
