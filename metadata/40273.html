But for reporter Andrew Torres and veteran helicopter pilot Russ Mowry, their worst fears are realized 800 ft. above the city. Their chopper spins out of control and nosedives, crashing onto a Brooklyn rooftop with the tail of the helicopter snapping off- all filmed by another news copter hovering right above the crash site. Minutes later, witnesses watch in awe as both passengers emerge from the wreckage.

Experience astonishing near-death experiences including a nearly five kilometre freefall, a helicopter crash and an SUV that topples a pedestrian.
When you see the footage, it is hard to believe anyone survived. 
But they did, and some would call it a miracle. 
And behind each of these stories is an unexpected scientific explanation. 
The Indestructibles explores mind-blowing, catastrophic events that seemingly should have ended in death but left survivors wondering how they could possibly still be alive.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Psychology, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-02-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
