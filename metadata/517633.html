Clark is a shark with zing, bang, and boom. Clark zooms into school, crashes through the classroom, and is rowdy at recess. Clark loves life &ndash; but when his enthusiasm is too much for his friends, Clark&rsquo;s teacher, Mrs. Inkydink, helps him figure out a way to tone it down. 'Clark the Shark' celebrates boisterous enthusiasm &ndash; and knowing when it&rsquo;s time for indoor voices.
