As the 29 miners remain inside the mine and dangerous gas levels prevent rescuers going in, it's been a day of high tech and hard questions. An army robot, special cameras and listening devices are being readied to go into the mine as soon as possible. Drilling work continues to drill a small hole into the mine to allow easier collection of gas samples. Details of all of this work is being conveyed to the waiting families and friends however there is a growing sense of frustration with the time it's taking for rescue teams to be allowed into the mine.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-11-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:00:00</td></tr></table>
