On February 22nd 2011 at 12:51pm, Christchurch was hit with a magnitude 6.3 earthquake. That level of energy was equivalent to two Hiroshima bombs. This energy release directly under the major city was a disaster. 9,000 buildings were destroyed and tens of thousands more were damaged. Entire suburbs were abandoned, thousands of people injured, and 185 lives lost. In this documentary, leading scientists take us below the earth's surface, inside walls, under buildings and onto archaeological sites to understand what it means to be living in a country that is an active earthquake zone and what the latest technology can do to help.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History, New Zealand, Political Studies, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:45:00</td></tr></table>
