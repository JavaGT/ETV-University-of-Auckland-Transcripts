Cairo Garbage simply takes you by surprise with its unique &ndash; but not uncommon &ndash; garbage disposal problem. Habituated to having a &lsquo;garbage community&rsquo; collecting garbage door-to-door and recycling it almost entirely in &lsquo;garbage villages&rsquo;, a recent sudden population explosion combined with the degrading health conditions in these garbage villages, has made the traditional garbage disposal mechanism obsolete. The result is garbage piles left for weeks on major streets, even as foreign contracting companies try to educate the population &ndash; of which, comically, the government has simply lost count! &ndash; on how to use the garbage bins correctly and how to dispose what garbage they manage to collect into pits in the middle of the desert.

&lsquo;Cities on Speed &ndash; Four Megacities Captured on Reel&rsquo;
The four key episodes of the series are directed by four different film makers, each of whom was selected by the The Danish Film Institute via a call for submission. Each tells a character-driven story of one of four different mega cities in the world and I recommend they be seen in this order; &lsquo;Shanghai Space&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cairo Garbage&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mumbai Disconnected&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Bogota Change&rsquo;. The films present a very unbiased view of the situations they document. In doing that, they do not direct or influence the viewer towards any one philosophy of change or being. Further, they are a convincing watch since they show live footage, shot over the period of documentation and well edited to nullify any unnecessary drama out of the real time situations. For anyone fascinated by big city contradictions, this set of films is a worthy indulgence.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Ecology & Environment, Economics, Geography, Political Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-08-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>04:30:00</td></tr></table>
