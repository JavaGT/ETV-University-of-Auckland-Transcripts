Miranda books herself into a hotel across the road, not telling her mother or her friends that she isn't leaving the country. As her stay goes on, she literally becomes a new woman.

About Miranda:

Miranda isn't your average girly girl and she seems to be a constant disappointment to her mother Penny (Patricia Hodge) who keeps trying to set her up with potential suitors, regardless of whether they are actually related to Miranda or not.
 
At 6 foot 1, Miranda gets called 'Sir' once too often, much to the amusement of her childhood friend Stevie (Sarah Hadland) who manages Miranda's joke shop.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:37:10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-06-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
