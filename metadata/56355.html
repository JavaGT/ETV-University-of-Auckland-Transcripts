You have so much freedom, and it's quiet when you need peace to study French. The worst thing about having your own place is keeping it nice and tidy. Deciding that a little clutter doesn't interrupt your French practice, you've put the dusting and the dishes on the back burner until you send out invitations in French. Too bad your friends showed up unannounced yesterday. You have to act fast, and so ask them in French to wait five minutes. Meanwhile, you quickly start making the bed and doing the laundry, but you can't keep the secret for long. You've forgotten how to clean the house and so you have to ask your friends for help in French. In this lesson you'll learn even more French expressions that will help with housework.
