Martin, now on bail, is also quizzed by his boss, Renner, as to why the Agadir file was keyed into his computer. Natalie and Will establish that a hotel chambermaid saw the computer before Martin went out. Wenborn's wife, suffering from post-natal depression, is arrested for shop-lifting, infuriating and embarrassing her unsympathetic husband. The grumpy detective later learns that Will successfully defended Spaull when the activist was accused of killing a little boy, the very murder case that later prompted Will's family to leave London. Will is non-committal when Wenborn quizzes him about the trial; however, as it turns out, Spaull had later confessed his guilt to Will, prompting Will's meltdown and move away from London. Jane, meanwhile, visits Alan's mother and learns that he was imprisoned for shooting another boy who was bullying him at school.

Injustice is a five-part psychological thriller from acclaimed writer Anthony Horowitz (Collision, Foyle&rsquo;s War). This event drama tackles a universal question...indeed it&rsquo;s at the heart of every country&rsquo;s legal system.
 
How does a defence barrister live with himself if he finds out that his client is guilty? William Travers (James Purefoy) is just such a man. Famous for defending the underdog, he is recovering from a nervous breakdown and the complete uprooting of his family and his work. When we meet him, he is working on low-level cases in rural Suffolk. His life is thrown off balance a second time when he happens to see a figure from the past across a station platform.

At the same time, an old university friend asks him to defend him for a murder he swears he didn&rsquo;t do. Travers finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that stretches far beyond the courtroom while fighting off the forces that may once again destroy him.

Injustice is a complex, nail-biting drama... an examination of morality on many levels. STARRING: James Purefoy (Camelot, Diamonds, Rome, Frankenstein), Dervla Kirwan (The Silence, Material Girl, Law &amp; Order UK) Charlie Creed-Miles (Criminal Justice, Five Days, Skins) and Nat Parker (Lewis, My Family, Land Girls, Hotel Babylon).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Law, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-11-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
