Sarah and George begin a secret affair and start meeting at the cottage for their romantic trysts. Anna attempts to subtly push her father towards Sarah, hoping that if she can get them together then he will be more open to learning about her relationship with Gino.

Set in rural Australia in the 1950s, 'A Place to Call Home' is a sweeping and romantic drama of one woman's journey to heal her soul and of a privileged family's confrontation with a changing era. Marta Dusseldorp leads the cast as Sarah Adams, a woman with a mysterious past who returns to Australia after 20 years abroad. Tragic news is about to cause her to make the long-delayed journey back home. Working her passage home aboard an ocean liner, Sarah becomes involved in the lives of the Blighs, a wealthy Australian family. She develops an immediate connection with handsome and charming widower George (Brett Climo), as well as his modern young daughter Anna (Abby Earl) and withdrawn daughter-in-law Olivia (Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-11-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
