About the first series 'The Early Years':
Ever wished your child came with an instruction manual? Well now there is one!

The brainchild of producer and presenter Jude Dobson, Raising Children is a comprehensive resource guiding parents from the delivery suite through the preschool and primary years and into double digits.

&ldquo;I feel passionately that we need to resource parents with trustworthy information,&rdquo; says Producer Jude Dobson. &ldquo;The life-changing experience of parenthood deserves a decent 'users guide' to help parents on their way.&rdquo;

In each episode, Jude visits a different well-known New Zealander with a child at the age and stage featured in that episode.

The first 10 episodes, which focus on newborns through to two-year-olds, feature Seven Sharp&rsquo;s Toni Street; radio host Paul Flynn; New Zealand rugby players Sherwin and Karina Stowers; international sports star Henry Fa&rsquo;afilli; ONE News presenter Melissa Stokes; world-champion boxer Shane Cameron; international actors Jonno Roberts and Georgia Hatzis; Silver Fern Joline Henry; media personalities Stacey and Scotty Morrison; and award-winning chef/ My Kitchen Rules judge Ben Bayly.

A second 10-part TV series &ndash; &lsquo;The Middle Years&rsquo; - follows with 10 new episode guests.

Raising Children is jointly funded by Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health, ACC, Sport NZ, Anchor, Kidicorp and The Ted Manson Foundation, with support from Plunket. Raising Children's on-screen experts are all highly regarded professionals who have bucket-loads of valuable knowledge and advice to share with viewers, and the stories also feature more than 20 families who candidly share their parenting stories.
