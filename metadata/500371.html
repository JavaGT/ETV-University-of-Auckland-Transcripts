The principle is fairly simple: light is shone onto a sample, usually using a laser. The sample responds to this excitation by absorbing, scattering, and re-emitting some of this light. This light, which contains a lot of information about the properties of the sample, is then collected and analysed using some optical elements and detectors.&lt;br&gt; Raman spectroscopy is such a technique. A Raman spectrum contains many different peaks. Each peak corresponds to the energy of the vibration of a chemical bond in the molecule. The Raman spectrum is therefore a nearly unique fingerprint of a molecule. This is used for example in analytical chemistry to identify the various molecules in an unknown sample. A more recent spectroscopic technique is Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). It consists of performing Raman spectroscopy on molecules located on very small (nanoscale) metallic objects. &lt;br&gt; At Victoria University, research concentrates on the understanding and the applications of SERS. The high sensitivity can for example be used to detect extremely tiny amounts of molecules, such as drugs or explosives. This could also allow us to develop many more biological tags, with a much higher specificity, to replace fluorescent tags. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Eric Le Ru - post-doctoral fellow in the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
