101 East investigates one of South Korea&rsquo;s worst peace-time atrocities and those allegedly behind it now living in Australia.
It is one of the darkest chapters in South Korea&rsquo;s post-war history, a site where thousands were allegedly enslaved, abused, raped and even killed.

Known as Brothers Home, it was supposed to be a shelter for the homeless, but according to witnesses and evidence from the site, from 1976 to 1987 it was the scene of one of the country&rsquo;s worst atrocities.

More than 30 years later, survivors are still fighting for justice.
