A building housing a reactor was destroyed in Saturday's blast at the Fukushima No.1 plant. The authorities said the reactor itself was intact inside its steel container. The Japanese government has sought to play down fears of a meltdown at Fukushima No.1, saying that radiation levels around the stricken plant have now fallen. Reuters news agency quotes a Japanese nuclear safety agency official as saying that tests indicate that at least nine people have been exposed to radiation from the plant, and local authority estimates suggest this figure could rise as high as 160. The tsunami that followed the 8.9-magnitude earthquake wreaked havoc along a huge stretch of on Japan's north-east coast, sweeping far inland and devastating a number of towns and villages. Powerful aftershocks are continuing to hit the region.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:59:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NHK World, Japan</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-03-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:00:00</td></tr></table>
