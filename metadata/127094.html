About the series:
Starring Oscar nominee and Emmy and Golden Globe&reg; winner Paul Giamatti and Emmy and Golden Globe winner Damian Lewis, Billions is a 21st-century examination of the profit and peril of chasing the American dream. The series is a bold, contemporary drama that melds the worlds of ultra-wealth, influence and corruption as personified in two highly ambitious opposing figures: hard-charging, blue-blooded, politically connected U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades (Giamatti) and brilliant, calculating, blue-collar billionaire hedge fund king, Bobby &quot;Axe&quot; Axelrod (Lewis). Set amongst the Machiavellian machinations of New York City power politics and finance, Billions weaves a complex, intricate narrative featuring a high-stakes game of predator-versus-prey.

Starring Damian Lewis (Homeland), Paul Giamatti (John Adams), Maggie Siff (Mad Men), Malin Akerman (The Comeback), Toby Leonard Moore (The Pacific), David Costabile (Breaking Bad) and Condola Rashad (Smash).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2016-02-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
