Desperate for money, Stephanie convinces her cousin to give her a job as a recovery agent with his bail-bond company. What she lacks in experience she makes up for in moxie, and she intends to bring in her cousin's biggest bail-jumper: Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara), a former vice cop and murder suspect who broke Stephanie's heart when she was in high school.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:43:01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-04-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:50:00</td></tr></table>
