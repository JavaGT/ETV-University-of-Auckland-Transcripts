This programme shows how Sony and Indesit are rising to the challenge by designing mass-produced products from recycled plastics. Case studies include a chair made from Playstations and washing machines that use parts made from recycled fridge plastic. We follow the design process from concept, to modelling, testing and evaluation. We also visit a state of the art plastics recycling plant to see how new technology is being used to process and convert waste products into high-grade polymers and how material properties and characteristics are identified using both destructive and non-destructive tests. The pros and cons of using virgin vs recycled materials are then discussed. 2009.
