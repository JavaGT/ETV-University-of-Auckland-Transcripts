There is film inside the notorious Changi Jail, built to house 620 inmates but crowded with 5300 men at the height of the war. The cameras follow the former POWs on their way home as the RNZAF planes travel back via Indonesia and Siam (Thailand) to pick up more New Zealanders. The film ends with Dr John, a former POW in Singapore, saying that reports of Japanese atrocities should not be discounted as he has firsthand knowledge that they are accurate.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:08:52</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
