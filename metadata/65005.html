Part detective story, part documentary, an unseen narrator goes in search of a painting of a Polynesian princess that he has fallen in love with. Along the way he meets artists, fans and critics of the kitsch art genre, as well as the mysterious Gauguin-like figure of Charlie McPhee. The film won Best Documentary at the 1997 Yorkton Film Festival, Canada.
Sima Urale, Samoas first female filmmaker, has brought touching stories of Pacific peoples to the screen, often from an NZ outsiders point of view. Urale credits her film success to determination and dealing with social issues close to her heart. Her lauded shorts (O Tamaiti, Still Life) were followed by her 2008 feature debut Apron Strings. Urale is head tutor at Wellington's NZ Film and Television School.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:47</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Art, History, Maori, New Zealand, Pacifica, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-08-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
