From its breathtaking wilderness and unique outback experiences to its stunning beaches and diverse urban culture.

In Perth, he sees how the impact of the mining boom has transformed the city, making some people very rich, and finds out how street art is flourishing in the state capital. He travels up to the north of Australia's biggest state to get a real taste of life in the outback, from herding thousands of cattle to landing on a remote community in the Kimberley. To cap it all, Rajan gets a close encounter with an Australian icon, the saltwater crocodile.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-09-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
