This programme takes a high volume, low unit cost product and follows the design process from concept to manufacture.  It shows how good design means using less material, having fewer and simpler components, so ensuring cheaper tooling and easier assembly. It illustrates how designers make use of primary and secondary research, the role of aesthetics and function, shape form and colour, and the importance of ergonomics and anthropmetrics. The programme also explores the benefits of CAD in testing, modelling, and rapid prototyping, and looks at how it has changed the designers role. 2009.
