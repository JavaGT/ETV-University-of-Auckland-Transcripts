As grief tears through the community, sisters Theresa and Helen fight to hold their lives and their families together. Secrets and lies begin to surface as long-held facades falter. Theresa is concerned about her son's increasingly troubling behaviour and fears that a past traumatic event is finally catching up with them, while Helen is forced to confront the deepening faults within her household. The residents of Hollington Drive are compelled to assist in the search for the missing child, but Theresa fears the worst. Is it possible that her own son was somehow involved in Alex's disappearance?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, English, Psychology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PG</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-07-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:00</td></tr></table>
