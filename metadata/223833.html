When the young, attractive Orton (Gary Oldman) meets the older, more introverted Kenneth Halliwell (Alfred Molina) at drama school, he befriends the kindred spirit and they start an affair. As Orton becomes more comfortable with his sexuality and starts to find success with his writing, Halliwell becomes increasingly alienated and jealous, ultimately ending in a tragedy that shocked the London theatre world. Director Stephen Frears was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and the film was nominated for three BAFTAs.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:50:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-01-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
