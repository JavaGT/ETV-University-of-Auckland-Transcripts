<tr><td align='left' valign='top'>etv/25655_people_of_the_waikat_640x360</td><td  align='left' valign='top'>LIBRARY - Archive NZ - People of the Waikato - 1956</td><td align='left' valign='top'>The Waikato River flows from the volcanic centre of New Zealand's North Island, past farm and city to the sea. The 240 square miles of Lake Taupo, main source of the river, is a renowned trout fishing region. Close to the lake the river plunges in waterfalls and rapids past the hot springs and spouting geysers of Wairakei thermal valley. Great hydro-electric schemes have brought engineers and builders to swell the ranks of the riverside dwellers - the Maori people, the farmers, and the city folk. People of the Waikato&nbsp;makes frequent pitstops along the 425 km path of NZ's longest river. Made in an era of post-war electricity shortages, the film balances requisite beautiful scenery with excursions into the Waikato's extensive hydroelectric system: including then-unfinished fourth dam Whakamaru, whose development was slowed by the discovery of clay in the foundation rock. Alongside brief glimpses of those who live and work on the river, there is footage of stunt-filled canoe races, Turangawaewae Marae, and a veteran boatman tugging coal.&nbsp;07.00 Good geyser + fx then Waikato rapids and Huka Falls + fx, 07.30 GVs Aratiatia rapids, 08.28 Lake Taupo outflow controls, 08.50 Karapiro dam and lake GVs, good GVs and fx inside the powerhouse. 10.00 Mangakino GVs (nice comment that young kids here will be grown up before all power schemes on the Waikato are finished). 10.30 GVs work on Whakamaru. (&ldquo;the dams will come down the river like steps. In it&rsquo;s fall from Taupo to the flatlands, the same water will generate power ten times over.&rdquo; GVs Maraetai. &ldquo;The Waikato is, in truth, the artery of the North Island.&rdquo;
Nice dairy farming GVs.
