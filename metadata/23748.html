When animals swarm they create a super-organism of power. They can attack food supplies, immobilise transport systems, undermine cities and even attack energy supplies. They can stop people in their tracks. From simple organisms such as swarming mayflies whose numbers can close entire roads, to the uncontrollable power of the locust swarm, this is a world of secret communication where individuals unite as one, often at greatest cost to human beings. The show's narrator, Dr Who actor David Tennant says, &quot;animals can sometimes reach such numbers they defy our understanding. They seem to rise up and invade our lives. They become superswarms so immense they are impossible to ignore.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-06-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
