About the Series:
In a parallel present where the latest must-have gadget for any busy family is a 'Synth' - a highly-developed robotic servant that's so similar to a real human it's transforming the way we live.
Now series two is upon us and if this exclusive first trailer is anything to go by we can expect more unsettling imagery, more pondering over what it means to be human and more sci-fi action, as the rift between man and machine deepens.
