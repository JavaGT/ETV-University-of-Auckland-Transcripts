Turangi township was built as the centre of the Tongariro Power Development. The scheme was developed to divert the water that flows from Ruapehu, Ngaruahoe, Tongariro from the Kaimanawa Ranges. The watershed area serving the scheme is more than 1000 square-miles, tunnelling covers 27 miles, canals 14 miles, four small dams and 1 large 200 foot concrete dam. Workers involved in the scheme total over 1500 scattered over a large areas.
