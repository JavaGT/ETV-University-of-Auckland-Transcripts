The Emmy(R)-nominated series Mythbusters aims to uncover the truth behind popular myths and legends by mixing scientific method with gleeful curiosity and plain old-fashioned ingenuity to create a signature style of experimentation. Inspiring a generation to inquire, interact and get involved with science, Mythbusters uses a signature brand of explosive experimentation to prove or disprove popular myths, misconceptions or legends. Over the past 11 years, the team has tested 946 myths, filmed over 7900 hours, created 840 explosions and used 56,500 yards of duct tape.
