About series:
Each episode of &quot;Face the Truth&quot; features real people with real problems -- both large and small -- and nothing is off the conversation table. The hosts search for solutions, and the panel offers its opinion on things which include dating and relationships, bad habits, parenting advice and everything in between. At-home audiences and those in the studio can weigh in with their thoughts and vote for who is right and who is wrong. &quot;Face the Truth&quot; is hosted by Vivica A. Fox and her panel of experts, including attorney Areva Martin, clinical psychologist Dr. Judy Ho, Judge Mary Chrzanowski, and life coach Rosei Mercado.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:36</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Interview, Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Media Studies, Psychology, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-01-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:00:00</td></tr></table>
