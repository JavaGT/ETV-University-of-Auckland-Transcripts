About series:
Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome is an incurable disorder causing uncontrollable verbal outbursts and physical tics. These can make it impossible for sufferers to work, make friends, or even go to the shops. Spitting, swearing and motor tics make even the simplest tasks difficult, and draw unwanted attention and judgement from society.

But at Camp Twitch, an annual event that offers friendship and support to around 100 people with Tourette&rsquo;s and their families, the &ldquo;twitchers&rdquo; are free to be themselves without anyone judging them. This camp changes lives.

This local documentary series follows the sufferers&rsquo; struggles to get work, find love and bring up kids in a society not designed to cope with Tourette&rsquo;s. The six episodes will follow Tourette&rsquo;s sufferers including Willliam, whose uncontrollable motor tics and loud shrieking make it too hard to go to school; Renee, whose severe case of Tourette&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t stop her being the best Mum she can be; and Adam, whose motor tics are so severe that even putting on shoes is incredibly difficult.  
While Tourette&rsquo;s is incurable, there are many things that those with Tourette&rsquo;s can do to manage their tics; including singing, driving and roller derby. We will also reveal the struggle that many tickers face to gain access to one medication known to effectively relieve the symptoms &ndash; medicinal cannabis (Sativex).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, New Zealand, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-07-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
