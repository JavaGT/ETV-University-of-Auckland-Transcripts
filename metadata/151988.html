About series:
Ageless Gardens is a visual celebration of gardens &ndash; and gardeners &ndash; with a special emphasis on the role gardens can play in healthy aging. The physical, mental, and social aspects of gardening can be important therapeutic factors in health and wellness. Gardening can bring us food, exercise, and keep our minds sharp as we age. Learning to adapt to changing physical, familial, and social situations is key to continuing to garden into our retirement years.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:46</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>COUNTRY99</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-04-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
