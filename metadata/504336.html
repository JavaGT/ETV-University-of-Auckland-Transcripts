HIT &amp; RUN
Late one night, agitated and highly intoxicated, 36-year-old Melissa Oates got behind the wheel of her car, and speeding at 110 kilometres an hour ploughed into a man walking along a suburban street. He was killed instantly. But Oates didn&rsquo;t stop. She told police it wasn&rsquo;t her fault: the man had jumped out in front of her car. Oates spent eight months in prison for dangerous driving, but the dead man&rsquo;s family say there&rsquo;s much more to this story for one simple reason: the victim was also Melissa Oates&rsquo; boyfriend. In a special investigation, homicide and forensic pathology experts re-examine the police evidence and their findings will surprise and shock.
