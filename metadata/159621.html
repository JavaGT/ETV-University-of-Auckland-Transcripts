Award-winning director of Wonder Woman, Patty Jenkins, directs Emmy-nominated Chris Pine and India Eisley in a stylish new mystery drama which charts the eerie story of Fauna Hodel, a young woman attendant in a Nevada casino in 1949. As Fauna investigates the secrets to her past, she crosses paths with Jay Singeltary, a former marine turned reporter, obsessed with uncovering the mystery behind the infamous and unsolved murder of the &lsquo;The Black Dahlia&rsquo; in 1947. Together they follow a sinister trail, which swirls ever closer to Hollywood gynaecologist, Dr. George Hodel &ndash; a man involved in the darkest debauchery and the spider in the web around the legendary Los Angeles murder.
