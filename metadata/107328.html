One ordinary week, four extraordinary families.  
 
Filled with hilarity and heartbreak, ITV&rsquo;s new documentary series, Happy Families, looks behind Britain&rsquo;s net curtains for an intimate insight into how we as families live, love and laugh.
 
More than the individual story of each family, by capturing life issues that resonate across the generational, social, cultural and geographical fabric of the country, the series sets out to show what it means to be a family in Britain today.
 
With cameras placed on fixed rigs throughout the home, capturing every moment from breakfast to bedtime, we filmed four families for one week each.  From the north of England to the south coast, toddlers to teenagers, child birth to marriage, from the breadline to middle class comfort &ndash; we interweave our four families to reveal what makes them the same and sets them apart, and what it means to be a happy family.
 
Each week we hear about family life from a different family member: A Mother&rsquo;s Tale &ndash; once a mum, forever a mum; The Kids&rsquo; Tale; The Dads&rsquo; Tale - Dads &ndash; what are they for? and finally, The Tale of Marriage - what keeps us together and drives us apart.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-06-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>23:10:00</td></tr></table>
