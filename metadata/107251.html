Pippa Wetzell, Gordon Harcourt and the Fair Go team are back in 2015 with New Zealand's most popular consumer affairs show.

Now in its 38th year, Fair Go is a solid mix of investigative journalism and good advice. The team - including Mark Crysell, Brodie Kane, Hannah Wallis and Garth Bray - aims to help individual New Zealanders who are battling bureaucracy, are victims of rip-offs or just people fighting for their rights. 

It doesn't matter whether the fight is with a local shop, a megacorporation or the government, if the amount in question is hundreds of thousands of dollars or just one. As the show&rsquo;s motto goes, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve been ripped off, short-changed or given the run-around and nobody wants to know&hellip; we do!&rdquo;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, New Zealand, Political Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-06-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
