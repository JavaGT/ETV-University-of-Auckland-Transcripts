Hemiplegia means one side of a person's body doesn't work as well as the other side. Tino has right-side acquired hemiplegia and Gabe has left-side hemiplegia. Their personalities are opposite too. Gabe is a chatterbox, while Tino can be a bit more shy, but he's got a great sense of humour.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-04-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:48:00</td></tr></table>
