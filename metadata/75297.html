Mary and Francis return to court after their two-month honeymoon, arriving while the Archduke Ferdinand of Bohemia (Jonathan Higgins) is visiting. Henry is having an affair with the Archduke's sister, and while they're having sex she accidentally falls out a window. Henry and Catherine work together to successfully make the Duchess' death look like a suicide. Bash is hunting in the woods where he meets Rowan (Hannah Anderson) and her brother Carrick (Kristian Hodko) who live there. Bash comes across Olivia, who is traumatized and has bite marks on her arms, and takes her to Nostradamus to be healed. Bash visits Mary to tell of his suspicions that Francis tried to have him killed; Francis denies this when Mary asks. Mary learns that Lola is pregnant with Francis' child, and stops her from getting an abortion that could kill her. Mary reluctantly agrees to keep Lola's pregnancy a secret, and promises to help her find a husband. Mary tells Bash to stop caring for her but Bash refuses. Bash goes to Rowan, who convinces him to stay in France, and they kiss.
