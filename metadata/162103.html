Junior designs a bike inspired by a futuristic big rig, but the massive amount of fab crushes his schedule. The OCC team builds a vintage military style bike with sidecar to benefit a foundation for wounded veterans.

About series:
Paul Teutul Sr. and Paul Teutul Jr. return with yet another season of American Chopper. The world-class motorcycle builders, and infamous father-son duo, continue to show why they are at the top of the high-pressure world of customised bike building and, are still working at reconciling their notoriously fractured relationship. As masters of their craft, the Teutuls push their design abilities to the limits, creating one-of-a-kind choppers via their renowned bike brands, Orange County Choppers (OCC) and Paul Jr. Designs.

 

Last season saw the pair reunite to work on a special project &ndash; rebuilding a Yankee bike. This time around they&rsquo;re restoring a 1951 Buick together as a way to continue working on their relationship, but things don&rsquo;t always go by the book. At OCC, Senior takes a huge risk by moving his company in a different design direction, toward shorter bobber-style bikes and away from their famous choppers. Meanwhile, Junior challenges himself to build a streamlined bike for the MLB Network to impress his dad, who recommended him for the job. However, the custom side panels that give the bike its modern look cause complications during fabrication and assembly.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Engineering, Media Studies, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-04-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
