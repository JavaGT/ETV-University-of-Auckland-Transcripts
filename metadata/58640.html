The good news: when they are behaving themselves, it's extremely easy to describe their behavior theoretically, experimentally and mathematically.  The bad news is they almost never behave themselves. In this episode of 'Crash Course Chemistry', Hank tells how the work of some amazing thinkers combined to produce the Ideal Gas Law, how none of those people were Robert Boyle, and how the ideal gas equation allows you to find out pressure, volume, temperature or number of moles.  You'll also get a quick introduction to a few jargon-y phrases to help you sound like you know what you're talking about.
