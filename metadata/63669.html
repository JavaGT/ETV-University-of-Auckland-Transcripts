'Doctor Who' is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC from 1963 to the present day. The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord - a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:46:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-06-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
