Winner of `The Great Interior Design Challenge', Sarah Moore gets brought into more renovation projects on the show `Money for Nothing'. In this series, Moore meets different people up and down the UK who are throwing out what they consider to be worthless goods. In each episode, the designer takes three of these worn-out, overused goods and gives them a new life. The items are transformed beyond recognition and given a bespoke edge, which in turn gives them a higher value. Any profit made on the products sold is returned to the original owners.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Business, Careers, Design, Economics, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-11-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
