Steve and Saskia live in Shrewsbury with their five-month-old daughter Cece and Saskia&rsquo;s six-year-old daughter Edi. They are a family who would love to be greener but just can&rsquo;t find the time to do it. Having a young family has prompted them both to start thinking about the planet and whether they can become more climate conscious, but a busy work and home life has meant that it&rsquo;s convenience and not the planet that is taking priority. Can they be convinced that being greener doesn&rsquo;t have to cost the earth or turn their lives upside down?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:17:16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Food Science, Health, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-08-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
