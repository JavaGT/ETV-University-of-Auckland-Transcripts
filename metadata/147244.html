About Series:
Adapted by BAFTA-winner Danny Brocklehurst from books by bestselling novelist Mark Billingham, In the Dark stars MyAnna Buring (Ripper Street, Banished) as Helen Weeks, a strong-willed detective drawn into the two most testing and personal cases of her career just as she begins her journey towards motherhood.

Helen Weeks is a gutsy detective in her mid-thirties, never lost for a pithy putdown, and never fazed by a challenge. But her tough exterior conceals a complex inner conflict. She is compelled by chaos and darkness, driven to self-sabotage by a secret buried in her childhood.

Torn between her headstrong partner, DI Paul Hopwood, and a passionate affair with another officer, Helen is nowhere near ready to become a mother &ndash; not least because she&rsquo;s not sure who the father is.

When the husband of an estranged school friend is accused of abduction, Helen returns to the insular hometown she thought she&rsquo;d left behind. In order to solve the case, Helen has to confront her painful past.

And when a brutal tragedy drags her into Manchester&rsquo;s dark criminal underbelly, she is forced to question even her closest relationships. Even if you love someone, can you ever really know them? Now just weeks from becoming a mother, Helen knows it&rsquo;s not just her own future at stake. But is it a future worth fighting for?
