Pickering recalls his idyllic childhood in Godzone - with the first automobiles, the advent of electricity, and early experiments in wireless radio. He had no idea that just forty years later he would be heading the world's most advanced space laboratory, the Jet Propulsion Lab, putting the first US satellite into orbit, sending the first craft to the moon, and exploring the solar system beyond. 
Through a series of interviews conducted with this titan of the space age before his death in March 2004 and interviews with colleagues such as astronaut Buzz Aldrin and physicist James Van Allen, we hear the inside story of the US space race - the successes and the failures - and can begin to understand the vision and tenacity that propelled pioneers, like Pickering, onwards to achieve the impossible. 
Even after his retirement, Pickering kept close links with the Jet Propulsion Lab right up to his death. He continued to attend launches and track the missions. He kept an office near to JPL and a parking space on site next to the current director. He was known affectionately around the lab as &quot;Mr JPL&quot; and &quot;the rocket man&quot;.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Engineering, History, New Zealand, Physics</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-04-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:01:00</td></tr></table>
