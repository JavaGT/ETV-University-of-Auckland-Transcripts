About series:
The Knights Templar were the most powerful, wealthy and mysterious military order of the Middle Ages, entrusted with protecting Christianity&rsquo;s most prized relic&mdash;the Holy Grail&mdash;and harbouring secrets capable of great destruction.

Executive produced by Jeremy Renner, Knightfall goes deep into the clandestine world of this legendary brotherhood of warrior monks. From their battles in the Holy Land, to their complex relationship with the King of France, to the betrayal that would ultimately lead to their tragic dissolution, the story of the Knights Templar has never been fully told until now.

Starring Tom Cullen (Downton Abbey, Black Mirror, Padraic Delaney (The Wind That Shakes the Barley, The Tudors), Simon Merrells (Spartacus, Dominion) and Olivia Ross (War and Peace, Blowing Louder than the Wind)</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:40:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-02-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
