Every pregnancy and birth is unpredictable and an easy early labour is not necessarily an indication of what happens towards the end. In this episode there's a serious emergency on the maternity ward when a baby's shoulders become wedged after the head has been delivered.

The condition is called 'shoulder dystocia' and occurs in about one per cent of natural deliveries.

Giorgi-Leigh (17) says she was devastated when she found out she was pregnant, having always told her mum she wanted to wait until she was in her late 20s. When she found out, she burst into tears. But she's come to terms with it now.

The father is Jack (18), her on-off boyfriend for years, who's in prison and will miss the birth. Giorgi-Leigh says Jack's been in and out of prison ever since he was 11, for 'borrowing' cars and joy-riding.

She says that he was happy about being a dad, but she points out that he's 'not happy enough to stay out of jail.'

Paul (47) and Dawn (37) both have children from previous relationships. Dawn has been married twice before and says that this time it's 'third time lucky'.

They met two years ago at work and are now married. Dawn never expected to find happiness again and certainly never expected to be having another child. It's been a whirlwind two years: getting together with Paul, marrying and becoming pregnant.

Dawn says Paul is completely different to her previous partners. She says he's 'independent' because she doesn't have to look after him like she did with the others. Paul is generous and thoughtful and she feels they are an equal partnership.

Dawn is nervous about giving birth and feels like she is having her first child all over again. She says it feels like a lifetime since she had Jasmine and has forgotten how to 'do anything'.
