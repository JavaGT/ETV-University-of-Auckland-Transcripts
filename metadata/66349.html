While Finch gets a new number, supermodel Karolina Kurkova, and assigns Fusco to the job, Carter is asked to interrogate the four suspects. Finch assists by creating fake information for Reese to substantiate the claims he gives while being interrogated. Elias offers to help Reese, but Reese refuses as the FBI knows that the 'Man in a Suit' has an affiliation with Elias. Finch bribes a suspect (Brendan Griffin) to tell the FBI who the man is. The suspect blames one of the other men but after another suspect (Who was relieved as he was in Iraq while the man in the suit was on the streets) (James Knight) is killed by a government assassin named Hersh (Boris McGiver), who knows that the Man in the Suit also has a connection to the Machine, Agent Donnelly suspects that he was bribed and the real man is Reese. During a brawl involving Reese and the other thugs to try and get him to show his combat skills and prove himself to be the Man in the Suit, Elias tells the thugs to back off, saving Reese and causing the experiment to be a failure. Carter questions the last suspect (Creighton James) in order to provoke him into attacking her, causing the FBI to believe that he is the man, securing Reese's release. Later, Reese visits Carter and thanks her, but Donnelly approaches them and realizes that Reese is indeed the Man in the Suit. He arrests Carter for conspiracy and Reese for murder. Finch attempts to meet with Fusco to assist him, but public phones begin to ring. Finch is hesitant at first but then takes the call. He rushes back and finds out that the next number is Donnelly. He calls Donnelly to warn him as a truck hits Donnelly's car. Kara Stanton walks out, killing Donnelly and sedating Reese.
