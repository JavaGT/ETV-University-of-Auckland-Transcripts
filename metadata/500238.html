The amphibian craft are at home on land and sea. In the water they use their tank treads as paddle wheels. A Higgins landing boat shows off its superior size and speed and the high bow that allows it to push up the beaches. 01.25 Miramar Wellington, Opens New Plunket Rooms: A brass band heralds in the opening of the Miramar Plunket Rooms, said to be the best in the country.  Local MP Robert Semple speaks to the crowd. The District Plunket Nurse holds weekly clinics and babies get regular check ups including getting their weight sand heights recorded. Miramar has many young families and the new mothers pack out the under-cover pram park and the new waiting room.  In the pre-school room, older children get health check ups. 04.15 RNZAF Catalina Squadron:  At an advance base for the RNZAF Catalina Squadron in the Pacific War, the airmen relax after a long day. But morning comes around quickly and at 2.50 they are woken to begin another 12-hour day of flying patrol. New Zealand crews ferried out the Catalina Flying Boats from America when the RNZAF took over some of the patrol work being carried out by the US naval planes. After fueling, the crew goes aboard and the base logs that another plane is off on routine patrol. This work includes keeping watch on Allied shipping in the sea-lanes below, escorting ships to safety and reporting on enemy shipping and submarines. Aboard, the pilots and navigators carry out routine work until three unidentified planes are sighted. Until their identity is confirmed the gunner takes no chances and gets into position. The signalman flashes out communication and discovers the planes are Mitchells &quot;no trouble to us but trouble for the Japs.&quot; The Catalina returns to base at the end of another routine flight - another long day's work for the RNZAF men flying &quot;with skill and care on a ceaseless vigil.&quot; &lt;br&gt;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:08:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
