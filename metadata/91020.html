It's a case of D.I.Y did they bother in Dunedin. Judy takes the good with the bad in Whangarei and pizza toppings and bonfires point to parties in Auckland.

About Renters:
Seven property managers take viewers along for a challenging ride into the property market, dealing with filth, damage and eviction.

This season, Dunedinites Jake and Gareth have a selection of student flats on their hands, including a flat where a tree house has been constructed without permission, and another which has been turned into a skate park.

Meanwhile, in Auckland, Judy has to deal with a man who hordes paper, and Rachel has an abandoned boat to deal with as well as shed-loads of abandoned belongings.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:48</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Criminology, Economics, New Zealand, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
