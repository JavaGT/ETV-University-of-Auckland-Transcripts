About series:
How does the drug trade work? Can it be stopped or should it be regulated? And what are the personal costs? Those are just some of the questions asked in this series, a comprehensive look at society's most abused drugs: cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana. First-person perspectives from traffickers, dealers, users, law enforcement and medical professionals detail how the drugs are processed and moved onto the streets, and the effects they have on the human body. It's a raw, eye-opening documentary about a billion-dollar industry.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:57:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, Health, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-09-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
