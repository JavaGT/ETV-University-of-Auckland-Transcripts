But when he seriously injures another boy in a game, his father decides they must flee, fearing the injured boy's family's revenge. Pedro sees this as weakness in his father, and although his father realises he is incapable of controlling his teenage son, the desperate situation brings them closer than they have ever been, and Pedro begins to understand the sacrifice his father has made. Nominated for the Critics' Week Grand Prize and the Golden Camera at Cannes.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:18:38</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Languages, Media Studies, Social Studies, Sociology, Spanish</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-01-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
