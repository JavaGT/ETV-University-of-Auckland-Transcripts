Boris compares himself to a jar of honey on a supermarket shelf ?the product of many countries?. He believes he is part Jewish, part French, part English, part American and unpredictably part Turkish. 
 Boris? paternal grandparents played a central role in his upbringing ? he already knows that his grandfather, Johnny, was the son of a Turkish journalist and politician who was ultimately kidnapped and lynched in the 1920s. Boris is keen to find out more about his Turkish great-grandfather especially what he was like and what events led to his death. 
&amp;#8232;Boris? half-French grandmother, Granny Butter, had always claimed that she was from posh stock and insisted that Boris and his siblings eat their crisps with a knife and fork. Boris is keen to see whether Granny Butter was actually pulling his leg on this matter.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-05-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
