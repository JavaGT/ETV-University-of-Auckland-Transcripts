from shakespeare to the internet, does the use of english support worldwide communication or damage local cultures? 

in the 21st century english is rapidly becoming the global language of choice in business, politics, the internet, the media and education. this in turn, is changing the world and the aspirations of individuals and nations. worlds of english looks at if english is a force for good or a force for bad in the world today.

english has moved across the world, provoking questions of cultural identity and resistance to the power and dominance of the language. british colonialism has left a controversial linguistic legacy. in india, english remains the language of government and administration, but the picture is often more complex. in south africa, while english has become a vehicle for cross community integration in some areas, some schools are rejecting english and choosing to teach in xhosa. 

opposition to the use of english in malaysian schools has even led to riots. at the same time, other languages have influenced english, creating rich and sometimes divisive variations. the authorities in singapore have waged a long and largely unsuccessful campaign to eradicate the popular crossbreed language known as singlish.
