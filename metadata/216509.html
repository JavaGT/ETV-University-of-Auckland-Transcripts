The Romans are here and set to stay. Two years on from his invasion of Britannia, General Aulus is romanising cooperative Celt tribes and crushing those who try to resist, with the help of his new ally, Celt Queen Amena. Aulus&rsquo;s behaviour raises suspicions that he has another agenda; one that raises ghosts from Amena&rsquo;s past and makes his threat to the Druids ever more critical.

The only form of hope for the Druids and Celts is Cait, a young girl who is being trained by outcast Druid Divis to fulfil a prophecy that would save Britannia from the Romans. But when a dead man wakes, two Druid brothers begin an epic battle of wills that divides the Druids and puts the prophecy in jeopardy. In a world where the gods hold power over everyone, the question is how much control does anyone have over their own actions? But while the gods don't deal, men do.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:44:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-10-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:10:00</td></tr></table>
