Today, she and her research group grow crystals of the new molecules they make in order to work out the three-dimensional arrangements of atoms within the molecules these crystals contain. Knowing the structure of new molecules is vital for understanding, and subsequently fine-tuning, the properties of such molecules.
Dr Jason Price uses copper sulfate to illustrate one way to grow crystals - slow evaporation of the solvent, in this case water. While these pretty blue crystals are quite large, most of the crystals the group makes are about 0.1 millimetres in size. The new molecules they make do not crystallise as readily as simple salts like copper sulfate.
Dr Andy Noble demonstrates another way to crystallise molecules, specifically ether vapour diffusion into a solution of the new compound. Before he can do this the compound must be synthesised. The new ligand PMAT is made in several steps from commercially available starting materials. Andy then adds a solution of PMAT to a solution of iron(II) ions to produce the new iron complex, [FeII2(PMAT)2](BF4)4, which can be isolated from the reaction solution, as crystals, by ether diffusion.
Growing a high quality, so-called single crystal of the new compound is the first essential step in analysing the 3D structure of the molecule. A 'single crystal' comprises lots of individual molecules. They are all packed together in a regular repeating array, a bit like the repeat patterns one sees in wall paper but in 3D.
Once the crystals form, the team subjects them to X-ray analysis using an X-ray diffractometer. Jon Kitchen explains how the diffractometer fires X-rays through a single crystal. From the diffraction pattern that forms (thousands of spots in space collected by the area detector of the diffractometer), the team can then determine the location of all of the atoms in space. This knowledge reveals the structure of the molecule, which is then modelled in 3-D on a computer.
