About series:
Created by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement.
New Zealand's capital is a hotbed of supernatural activity... so Officers Minogue and O'Leary, who featured in the vampire documentary What We Do In The Shadows, take to the streets to investigate all manner of paranormal phenomena.
Aliens, demons, zombies, werewolves and vampires, they&rsquo;re all out in force in Wellington.

To fight these paranormal threats, Sergeant Ruawai Maaka has set up the first, classified Paranormal Unit of Wellington Police.

Now Officers Minogue and O&rsquo;Leary have been reassigned to the new unit, bringing a wealth of experience and a dedication to keeping Kiwis safe.

They had their first encounter with the supernatural when they appeared in the documentary What We Do In The Shadows.

They are ready to put themselves in danger - and they take paranormal phenomena very seriously.

The supernatural community of Wellington is thriving but it's still small enough that familiar faces, like Dion the Werewolf and Nick the Vampire, crossed paths with Minogue and O'Leary in the course of filming. 

Get ready to follow these two normal cops into extraordinary situations and unearth a side of Wellington you might have only heard about in stories.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies, New Zealand, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-09-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
