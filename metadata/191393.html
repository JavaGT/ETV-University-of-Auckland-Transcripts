About series:
Australia: Life on the Edge embarks on a spectacular, entertaining and thrilling circumnavigation of Australia&rsquo;s stunning coastline, from Sydney Harbour to the Great Barrier Reef, taking in the wild Northern Territory and round to the shark-attack hot-spot of Perth. Led by a diverse team of adventurers, marine biologists, historians and geologists, this is the real Australia like you've never seen it before. Much of Australia&rsquo;s identity has been derived from the bush myth but this series focuses on the maritime legend that has helped shape life on the edge of the world&rsquo;s largest island continent. In each episode, the passionate and charismatic expert hosts explore on land, by sea and under the water to uncover the incredible landscapes, structures, people and stories that continue to influence the nation today.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Geography, History, Natural History, News, Social Studies, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-09-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
