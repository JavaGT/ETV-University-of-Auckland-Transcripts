They live their lives with technology at their fingertips. In this programme we discuss how education systems are undergoing a transformation, and how e-learning is becoming further integrated into the classroom. We look at the benefits of e-learning, and how by engaging students on a level and with material to which they will respond can make a teacher's job easier. Introducing e-learning methods and strategies, we also investigate the benefits of Learning Management Systems and how these changes in teaching methods are benefiting both teachers and students.
