As the planes approached the NZ coast, a Loadstar carrying the Weekly Review cameraman was hit by one of the Sutherlands sustaining minor wing damage.  Crews of the flying boats are welcomed in Auckland and Wing Commander Baird comments on the long trip.  02.05 Wartime Farming:  Outwardly World War Two has not brought much change to New Zealand farming - grain is still harvested, sheep are still mustered and cows are still milked - but there are fewer men to work the land as sons and fathers left their tractors for tanks and bombers.  To the farmers' assistance have come the land girls - women who have come back to the farms for the duration of the war. Women have taken over other country jobs too such as herd testing to check the quality of milk production and improve overall farm efficiency.  The land girls excel at mothering young animals like calves but also do jobs such as ploughing the fields. Returned servicemen are also trained as farmers - the first step in their rehabilitation. The men hold a competition to see how can produce the fattest lamb. Former farmers also go back to the land after returning from the war and their experience is crucial as New Zealand endeavours to raise its production to further help the war effort. Some ex soldiers are shown back in the shearing shed.  New Zealand produce and meat is loaded onto ships for export to Europe - another New Zealand contribution to victory.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:08:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
