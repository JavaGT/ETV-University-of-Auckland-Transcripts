Ross Kemp travels to the world's most violent city, Juarez, Mexico. Reduced to a warzone, competing cartels fight for ownership of the drug smuggling routes to the US.

Kemp travels around the world talking to people involved in illicit trades, locals who have been affected by violence and hardship, and the authorities who are attempting to combat the problems. In each episode he attempts to establish contacts within the groups in order to get close to the ringleaders.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Geography, Law, Political Studies, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
