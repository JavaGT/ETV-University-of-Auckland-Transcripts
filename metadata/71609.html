The ladies set each other up on dates for their annual birthdate celebration. Victoria is set up with previous cruise ship fling, Captain Lebeau; Melanie is set up with a Jersey Boys cast member (Roger Bart) who has an unfortunate trait; Joy dates Melanie's former priest (Andy Richter), and Elka dates someone who might be magical (Paul Dooley).

They lease a home with a sassy caretaker (Betty White).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:35</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-12-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
