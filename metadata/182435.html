Over the past few months, digital tracking apps in South Korea and China have helped curb the spread of COVID-19 in those nations. The apps work by notifying people about their possible exposure to coronavirus-positive patients, and advising them to self-quarantine.

Eager to restart the economy and end lockdowns, many other countries, including the United States and France, are also working to roll out smartphone apps. Most will use GPS or Bluetooth data to help identify and quell outbreak clusters.

But privacy advocates warn that this type of digital tracing is vulnerable to abuse, especially if an individual's personal data falls into the wrong hands. The move could also usher in a new age of government surveillance that remains even after the pandemic abates.
