Mike Moss is doing his bit to deliver on New Zealand's image as a 100 per cent pure food producer. The 49-year-old farmer from the Waitetuna Valley near Raglan is producing some of the world's most sought after milk on his fully certified organic dairy unit in the Waikato. Mike and his fiancee Madeline Rix-Trott milk 140 organic dairy cows twice a day - dairy company Fonterra takes virtually every drop to satisfy growing demand from consumers in Asia and the United States. Mike says New Zealand has the potential to become the healthy food basket of the world.
