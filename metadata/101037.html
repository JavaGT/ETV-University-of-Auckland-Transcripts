About the series:
The Big Bang Theory is a popular American sitcom from Chuck Lorre Productions and Warner Bros. Television, which airs on the CBS television network in the United States and TV2 in New Zealand.  The show stars Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch. The Big Bang Theory was created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers along with showrunner Steven Molaro. Bill Prady was the showrunner for the first five seasons.

The Big Bang Theory is centered on physicists Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter, whose geeky and introverted lives are changed when Penny, an attractive waitress and aspiring actress, moves into the apartment across from theirs. Penny quickly becomes a part of Sheldon and Leonard's social group, which includes the equally geeky engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali, with Penny's common sense and social skills and the guys' geeky interests expanding each other's worlds. The newest additions to the group are Howard's wife Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz and Sheldon's girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-03-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
