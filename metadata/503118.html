Both are passionate about local produce and inherited a love of cooking and baking from their parents, who had a local bakery for years. Sarah is in the Green Pepper kitchen with Akis Petretzikis, and Karen is paired with Ellis Barrie in the Red Tomato kitchen, and after a fabulous first cook, it all comes down to the Ten-Minute Challenge to decide who will be today&rsquo;s winner.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, Food Science, Health, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-08-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
