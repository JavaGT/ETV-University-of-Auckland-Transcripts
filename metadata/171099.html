Outraged, defiant and united behind a demand for political change.

Lebanese people from all religious and political backgrounds are calling for the prime minister, president and other leaders to resign.

They say they want a revolution and many are criticising their own political leaders - something unprecedented in a country divided by sectarianism.

The largest protests in years were sparked by tax reforms that included charging to use the social media service WhatsApp.

The proposed taxes were quickly scrapped but there are other, longstanding grievances, including high unemployment, constant electricity shortages, poor infrastructure and corruption.

The protests are a challenge to the unity government and Prime Minister Saad Hariri.

He blames parties in his coalition for obstructing reforms required to unlock $11bn in aid pledged by international donors.

Are there hopes for meaningful political and economic change?
