About series:
This three-part series from PBS and BBC goes behind the scenes of the aviation industry to uncover the global networks and logistics that allow daily air travel to continue around the world. From the world's coldest airport (Yakutsk, Russia) to the most dangerous (in the Himalayas), the series visits remote places such as the world's largest luggage storage facility. American sites include Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, MedAire, Inc. in Phoenix, Seattle's Boeing facility and the Bangor International Airport in Maine.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:07:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Engineering, Information Technology, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-08-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
