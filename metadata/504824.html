The product life cycle is a theoretical model showing the stages that products go through from creation to discontinuation. Although all products don't go through the product life cycle the same, the model does provide a general framework for how businesses should adapt their marketing mix to the stage the product occupies in the product life cycle. 

In the first video of a four part series, we'll explore some of the basic elements of the product life cycle. We'll also talk about the introduction stage of the product life cycle and how businesses can support their products during this stage.
