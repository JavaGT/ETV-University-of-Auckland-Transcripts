But I&rsquo;m also starting to realise that great meaning lurks in dead-ends, misfires, bad shoots and flawed scripts. Projects I thought soaked up my most precious commodity might have great meaning after all. This film is another batch of short stories that didn&rsquo;t make it on their own, and while at first glance seemed like a huge waste of time, turn out to be anything but.
