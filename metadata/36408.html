Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr, better known as Joe Sr., as United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1938, tries to keep his country out of World War II, having openly supported the Munich Agreement despite President Franklin D. Roosevelt's clear opposition. Roosevelt pressures the ambassador into resigning in 1940. Jack serves in the war aboard Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109 despite his father's previous opposition to the war. Joe Jr. dies in Operation Aphrodite. Joe Sr. wants Jack eventually to become president. 

Using public events as a background, The Kennedys follows the chronology of John F. Kennedy's entrance into politics, through to his sudden departure. It is about epic achievements and private failures, about loyalty and love, resentment and betrayal, about people imbued with great gifts and burdened by great flaws, about success of Biblical proportions and tragedy worthy of the Greeks. Tonight, it is the eve of the 1960 presidential election, and John F. Kennedy is poised to become the youngest man ever elected to office. While he and a heavily pregnant Jackie are forefront in the media spotlight, behind the scenes Kennedy family patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., one of America's richest men, works furiously to ensure his son's victory over Richard Nixon. The elder Kennedy poured $10 million of his own money into the campaign, and he drafted his other son Bobby to be the campaign manager.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:09:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-10-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:38:00</td></tr></table>
