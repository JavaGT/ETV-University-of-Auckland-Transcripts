Jon Hamm and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) star in this wry comedy drama about a young doctor's fledgling career as he begins his new life in a small, backwards Russian village. Based on the semi- autobiographical short stories by Bulgakov, set on the eve of the Russian Revolution, it tells the story of the young medical graduate's turbulent and brutal introduction to his practice, narrated by his older, more experienced self.
