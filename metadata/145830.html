But in uncertain and changing times, what does the future hold for Britain's style bible?

Documentary maker Richard Macer is given access to British Vogue for the first time in its history. He follows them for a year, seeing how the magazine is put together from the catwalk shows to photoshoots to the front cover. It is a significant year for the magazine as it prepares to celebrate its centenary with a raft of events including a huge exhibition of photography at the National Portrait Gallery, a bumper centenary issue of the magazine and a gala dinner. But Macer finds a world not just intent of celebrating the glories of the past, but also facing up to the challenges of an uncertain future, with Instagram and other social media starting to challenge Vogue's exalted position. Could Alexandra Shulman, editor-in-chief of British Vogue for the past 24 years, ensure the magazine stays on top?

In the second episode of his two-part series on British Vogue, Richard Macer discovers a world of deception at the heart of the fashion bible. 2016 is the centenary year of the British magazine and a whole host of star-studded events have been lined up to commemorate the year, including a huge exhibition of Vogue photography at the National Portrait Gallery, a festival of fashion, a bumper centenary issue and a gala dinner with guests including Kim Kardashian and Samantha Cameron.

British Vogue has lots of glamorous rising stars like fashion features director Sarah Harris and fashion news editor Julia Hobbs, but at the helm of British Vogue are two women who have been in charge for a quarter of a century. Alexandra Shulman, the editor-in-chief, and fashion director Lucinda Chambers have been making decisions which affect the wardrobe choices of British women for the last three decades. What will happen to the magazine when they eventually decide to leave? And will Vogue still be a publication in its current form in a few years time, with social media dramatically changing the way people consume fashion?

Halfway through filming this auspicious year, Macer gets a phone call from the Vogue press office that dramatically changes the whole direction of the film. As Richard speculates on whether British Vogue's centenary will be Alexandra's swansong, events start to unfold which demonstrate that far from being about to retire, Alexandra has just pulled off a spectacular journalistic coup right under Richard's nose.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:44</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Business, Careers, Design, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-09-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
