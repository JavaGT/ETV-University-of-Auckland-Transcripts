Christchurch at risk of losing CBD.
If you haven't visited Christchurch since the earthquakes, when you do go back you'll notice how much the CBD has changed.
Much of it has gone and the empty space is somehow shocking.
Where it's staging a comeback, like Cashel Street, it's so different from what was there before.
In the meantime, businesses have gone in search of homes elsewhere. As a flash, new CBD is planned there's a real risk Christchurch will have somehow moved on without it.
Just today, the city's central development unit announced it wants more than 20,000 people to live in a vibrant and prosperous central city in the longer term.
But where are they going while they wait?

Chaos and confusion with Auckland's Unitary Plan.
If Auckland is indeed a shambles - slow moving, too expensive, and spreading like a red wine stain - the Unitary Plan is perhaps an appropriate response.
But, it's been shambolic, too. Particularly the issue of density - how dense is too dense? How dense isn't dense enough? Should some areas be more dense than others?
In the meantime, confusion prevails because what is the case now may not be the case soon.
We've found a classic example of that in the west Auckland suburb of Glen Eden.
It doesn't meet the minimum design standards set at the moment.
But here's the odd thing - it wouldn't meet them under the Unitary Plan either.

When snapper goes bad.
You know that new car smell - it's great isn't it?
And depending on how well you look after your new motor  it can last quite a while.
But an Auckland man has accidently discovered a way to get rid of it in the most awful way possible.
