As New Zealanders, we&rsquo;re famous for our strong work ethic and ingenuity. In episode two we uncover a collective, diverse history of WORK through the memories and home movies of ordinary Kiwis.

From the roots of our primary industries to the front land of new technology, the reign of unions and share club fever, Decades In Colour reveals the myriad of ways we &ldquo;made ends meet&rdquo; from the 1940s to the 1980s.

Conducting another nationwide search for home-shot colour footage, this NZ On Air Platinum Funded series weaves together home movies, personal anecdotes and communal memories of the different ways Kiwis worked, lived and played.
