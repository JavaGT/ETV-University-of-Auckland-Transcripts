About series:
Designer and animal enthusiast Antonio Ballatore brings his visionary and innovative design aesthetic to pet lovers everywhere in the new series Animal Cribs &ndash; transforming standard spaces into pet paradises with some outrageous renovations. In Animal Cribs, Antonio, his project manager Grace, and his right hand-dog, Chewie the bulldog, along with a team of Catsperts and Barkitects, transform drab, cramped homes and outside areas into functional, high-style spaces for both pets and the people they love. Antonio&rsquo;s excitement for both design and animals drives him to go the extra mile for his clients and their four-legged, winged, and scaly friends. The newly designed spaces, renovated specifically for the homeowners and their pets, feature design elements that alter homes to become creative and purposeful spaces for all to enjoy.

This season on Animal Cribs viewers will see a cabin redesigned for a family and their blind dog; a complete backyard renovation featuring a pet-safe fire-pit; a man-cave that can accommodate 20 pets; and a room design complete with a soaring sculptural cat climbing wall, among other amazing transformations.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:52</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Engineering</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ANIMAL PLANET</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-05-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:40:00</td></tr></table>
