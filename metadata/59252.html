The block is used to demonstrate the scissor over comb technique. The main lessons learned from this film are how to hold the comb, the angle of the comb when using a scissor over-comb method, and the best way of holding long lengths of hair with the comb. This exercise is sure to bring on aching arms at first, but with practice and it will help students steadily hold the sections.
