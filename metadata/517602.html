Jimmy Barnes has well and truly lived the rock n roll lifestyle - admitting he's done plenty that isn't conducive to a long life. Alcohol, drugs and decades of partying - and then late last year Barnesy was struck down with a blood infection that spread to his heart. He was close to death and needed emergency open-heart surgery. Feeling lucky to be alive still, he's planning a new future with the realisation of what's truly important.

GANGING UP
Gangs are in the firing line. The new government is promising to crack down on crime, banning gang patches and insignia, and prohibiting members from gathering in public. Opotiki is one place where gang culture, shootings and drug houses have made headlines. Some say the gangs run the town, they certainly outnumber police. So how do those on the thin blue line think this will play out? Sunday speaks with officers who've broken rank to share their concerns, saying that they just don&rsquo;t have enough boots on the ground to enforce the bans. A Sunday exclusive investigation.
