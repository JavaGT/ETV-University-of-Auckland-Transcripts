Released in 1991, it single-handedly  was responsible for the birth of what became to be known as grunge and has gone on to sell over 8 million copies in the US alone.

'Nevermind' was the second album from the Seattle trio and the first on the 'DGC' label (it's predecessor 'Bleach' was released on the 'Sub Pop' label). It was produced by Butch Vig (also the drummer for the band 'Garbage') and mixed by Andy Wallace.

Nirvana's surviving members Krist Novoselic (bass) and Dave Grohl (drums) talk candidly about their past, the recording of 'Nevermind' and about Kurt Cobain and the legacy that he has left behind. Also featured are exclusive interviews with the likes of Garry Gersh (A&amp;R DGC Records), Butch Vig, Jonathan Ponneman and Nils Bernstein (Sub Pop Records), Thurston Moore ('Sonic Youth'), Jack Endino, and many more.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:13:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-09-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:38:00</td></tr></table>
