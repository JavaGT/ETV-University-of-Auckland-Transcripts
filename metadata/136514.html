About the Games:
The 2016 Summer Paralympics, the fifteenth Summer Paralympic Games, are an upcoming major international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016. They are the first Summer Paralympics to be held during the host city\\'s wintertime. 
These Games will see the introduction of two new sports to the Paralympic program: canoeing and the para-triathlon.

More than 170 member nations of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) are expected to compete in the 2016 Rio Games. The spotlight turns to 20 of Rio de Janeiro\\'s arenas, where competition takes place for medals in the 23 Paralympic sports, in addition to the Games&rsquo; opening and closing ceremonies.

The lead-up to these Paralympics have been met with major financial issues, which were primarily attributed to tepid sponsor interest and ticket sales. These shortcomings have resulted in cuts to volunteer staffing and transport, the re-location of events and the partial deconstruction of the Deodoro Olympic Park. However, none of these cuts have affected the Games themselves.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:10:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2016-09-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
