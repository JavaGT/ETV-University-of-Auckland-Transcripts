However, when the heady rush of their early passion wears off, Hester gradually comes to understand that Freddie doesn't feel the same way about her as she does about him, just as she, in turn, is unable to return her husband's love.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:33:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-08-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:50:00</td></tr></table>
