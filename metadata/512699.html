Transport Minister David Parker says the Government can deliver on its promise of an additional Waitemata Harbour crossing in Auckland despite failing to achieve its 2017 light rail policy.   
The $40 billion project will initially see two new road tunnels built, with construction due to start 2029.  
But Bike Auckland says it's too late, there needs to be options for walkers and cyclists now rather than decades in the future.

There's been a call for more sex education to be taught inside New Zealand households...It follows National Party leaders saying those conversations belong at home rather than at school.
