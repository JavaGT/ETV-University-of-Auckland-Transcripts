In a landmark defamation trial, Australia&rsquo;s most revered and decorated soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, has been found to be a murderer and a war criminal. The decision came after Roberts-Smith sued reporters Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters, who&rsquo;d investigated the actions of the Victoria Cross recipient during his time serving in Afghanistan. Far from being a war hero, Roberts-Smith broke moral and legal rules of military engagement, including being involved in the murders of innocent Afghan civilians. This week, McKenzie and Masters detail their own harrowing journey to justice and reveal new information about what really happened in Afghanistan.

Sunday talks to young vapers, school leaders, medical researchers, and the Minister of Health to find out why we are facing looming addiction crisis, and whether the new restrictions are too little, too late.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Magazine, News, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Health, History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-06-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:03:00</td></tr></table>
