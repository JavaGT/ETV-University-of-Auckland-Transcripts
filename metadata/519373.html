The video avatar is generated by Hour One, its voice was created by Eleven Labs, and its persona&mdash;the way that REID AI formulates responses&mdash;is generated from a custom chatbot built on GPT-4 that was trained on my books, speeches, podcasts and other content that I've produced over the last few decades. I decided to interview it to test its capability and how closely its responses match&mdash;and test&mdash;my thinking. Then, REID AI asked me some questions on AI and technology. I thought I would hate this, but I&rsquo;ve actually ended up finding the whole experience interesting and thought-provoking.
