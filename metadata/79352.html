Fashion Colour Stencil, incredibly early fashion footage from the 1900s. A lady looks at herself in a full length mirror wearing a dark dressing gown. She slips it off to reveal a garter on her right knee before lifting her foot up and looking at the camera in a sexy pose. Next a lady pouts against the mirror in a lime green dress with a bow. and we see a lady in mauve undergarments with lace trimmings. She sits at a vanity table and begins to powder herself whilst the camera focuses on her pleated cami-knickers.
