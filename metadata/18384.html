Mentoring may be largely a thing of the past  as is a club scene that encouraged young, aspiring musicians to get onstage and jam with more established players. Still, there remains a sense of community engendered through groups who are committed to being more than just a collection of musicians coming together to play; they're families who, through months and years of touring, share far more than just the music- although the music is often more than enough. 

Jazz is a living thing, a conversation between musicians and each other as well as musicians and the audience. By combining archival footage, interviews with 75 jazz artists and live recordings culled from 25 hours of concerts, 'Icons Among Us' is a dynamic and engaging document of many of the greatest jazz musicians of today.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Interview, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-11-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
