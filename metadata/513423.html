Astronomer Avi Loeb argues that a 2017 sighting of an interstellar space object, which scientists named &lsquo;Oumuamua, was evidence of advanced alien technology.

His controversial hypothesis generated curiosity and excitement while also putting him at odds with astronomers who believe in a more natural explanation for the &lsquo;Oumuamua phenomenon. Perhaps &lsquo;Oumuamua was an abnormal asteroid or comet, some say. But Loeb, a Harvard professor and a former chair of its astronomy department, believes the oblong space object was an alien lightsail, propelled through our solar system by energy from a sun or star.

In this episode of The Stream, we&rsquo;ll speak to Avi Loeb about his latest book, &ldquo;Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth&rdquo; and ask why he believes we are not alone in the universe.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-08-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
