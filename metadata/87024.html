Showing a keen affinity for the embarrassment of his own formative years, filmmaker Greg Mottola brings back the 80s and makes a coming-of-age comedy with real feeling. &quot;As in Superbad and The Daytrippers,  director Greg Mottola plows the salted fields of conventional movieland comedy - in this case that means hormone-crazed youth, summer jobs, an amusement park - and comes up with something startlingly fresh and amazingly unstupid. An absolutely note-perfect rendering of early-80s nowheresville boredom, great lead performances by Jesse Eisenberg and Kirsten Stewart (Twilight's Bella) and an irresistible supporting cast of convincing suburban archetypes. You'll believe you were there - and quite possibly you were.&quot; - Andrew O'Hehir, salon.com. &quot;The 80s, at least at the time, appeared drenched in irony&amp; It's Mottola's funny and touching inspiration to look back and see how unself-conscious the decade now seems.&quot; - Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly
