It provides the time framework for all studies of the history of the Earth and its life. It is used for assigning geological age to rocks, fossils and economic minerals, and for calibrating the rates of geological processes such as fault displacement and plate rotation, submergence, uplift and erosion of the land, earthquake frequency and volcanic activity. Rates of climate change, sea-level change, biodiversity change and organic evolution also are measured in terms of the geological timescale. &lt;br&gt; Dating rocks with fossils uses the succession of species of animals and plants that are found in successive layers of rock, or strata. Changes in fossil species through time have resulted from evolution, migration and extinction. Fossils yield a relative time scale: one in which events or time periods are placed in chronological order but not dated absolutely in terms of thousands or millions of years ago. To determine such absolute ages for specific events or horizons in New Zealand's geological record we use radiometric dating of mineral grains, shells or bone. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Hamish Campbell - Geologist/Paleontologist with the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences.
