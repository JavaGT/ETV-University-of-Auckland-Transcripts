Genghis Khan - the bloodiest warlord in history - swept south from Mongolia into China and created a mighty empire. He left 40 million dead bodies in his wake.  But a greater killer stalked Mankind - the Plague.  Traveling along Mongol trade routes, the disease wreaked havoc in Asia and Europe - the greatest biological disaster in history. But the Americas were unaffected. There, civilizations flourished in isolation.
