Planes, including those from the RNZAF,  roar down the Guadacanal airstrip to &quot;go and hunt the Japs.&quot; The next Kiwis to arrive are soldiers from the New Zealand Army 3rd Division. They have seen action in the northern Solomon Islands in the taking of Vella Lavella and &quot;now they're still at it, getting ready for another smack at the Jap.&quot; First comes maintenance work on trucks, guns and tanks. They also test their tanks in the thick jungle, breaking through trees and undergrowth, slushing through mud and fording high, fast-flowing rivers. The soldiers give the tank guns a workout before collecting their gear in readiness for a move. At the beach, ships and barges are loading up in a huge operation - &quot;embarkation Guadalcanal-style.&quot; Air cover and sea power have kept the Japanese Zeros away and the operation continues safely. Since the earlier battles on other islands, the Japanese have gone to ground and is waiting - now the Allies, including the New Zealanders, are on their way &quot;to force another showdown with Tojo.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-10-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:06:02</td></tr></table>
