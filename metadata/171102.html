About series:
How far would you go for love?

Following a personal tragedy that shatters his comfortable life, talented and successful surgeon Daniel Milton partners up with a lonely yet resourceful young man named Lee to start a literal 'underground' clinic, situated in the vast labyrinthine network of tunnels and spaces beneath London.

There Daniel treats all those who cannot, or will not, seek more legitimate means of healthcare: criminals, illegal immigrants, and the just plain weird. Of course, such a risky endeavour is not without its surprises, and Daniel and Lee are soon joined in the bunker by Anna, a guilt-ridden medical researcher, and Jamie, a young fugitive bank robber who is in way over his head.

And so, down in the bowels of the city, the good doctor must do his best to juggle this misfit team and their needs alongside those of an illegal clinic and its increasingly unpredictable clientele. But Daniel also has another mission, one close to his heart, and as he begins to push his moral boundaries as both a doctor and a man, it becomes worryingly apparent that it may actually be him and his desperate actions that finally bring the whole thing crashing down...

Starring Mark Strong (The Imitation Game), Carice van Houten (Game of Thrones) and Daniel Mays (Line of Duty).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:44:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Health, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-10-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
