Many arrive here with little but the clothes they are wearing. They are apprehensive and wonder how they will be received in this strange country so far away from their homelands. The refugees arrive an an orientation camp for a short course on New Zealand's way of life and basic English lessons. Many of the youngsters have never been to school before. The adults learn the NZ currency and system of weights and measures. The commentary notes that, in no time at all, these new settlers will become good New Zealand citizens.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:10:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
