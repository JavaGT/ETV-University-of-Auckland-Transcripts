Salvage teams are tonight feeling more optimistic about getting oil off the stricken ship the Rena and pumping of fuel from the wreck could start tomorrow. The slick is now moving east beyond Maketu and teams are braced for the worst along Whakatane's coastline. The ship remains intact and better weather allowed salvage teams to board the ship today despite it being a risky and dangerous operation. The ship is leaning at 21 degrees and there are now over 3000 registered volunteers working on the clean up.

Prime Minister John Key said the apology from the ship owner is a very small fraction of what needs to be answered. Families who had stored most of their possessions in containers to move from overseas to Tauranga are facing huge losses. More than 350 of the 1700 tonnes of oil on the Rena has spilled into the water, and thermal imaging has made Maritime New Zealand (MNZ) confident there is still oil in the tanks.
