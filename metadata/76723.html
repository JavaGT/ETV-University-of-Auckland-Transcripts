Jack McCracken: a man of principle in a corrupt world. But not for long. Moments after taking over his father-in-law's business he's approached by a private detective armed with some compromising information. Jack's integrity fades away as he discovers his extended family to be thieves and adulterers, looting the business from their suburban homes. Rampant self-interest takes over and comic hysteria builds to a macabre climax.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:39</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Current Affairs, Documentary, Entertainment, Instructional, Interview, Magazine, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Anthropology, Art, Business, Careers, Design, Drama, Economics, Health, Leadership, Learning Support, Literature, Media Studies, Physical Education, Political Studies, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:00</td></tr></table>
