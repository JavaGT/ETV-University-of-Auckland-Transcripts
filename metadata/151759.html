Oliver hosted a stand-up show for four seasons on Comedy Central, and he was also responsible for co-writing and co-presenting the popular weekly satirical podcast &quot;The Bugle.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Current Affairs, Interview, Magazine, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, News, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-04-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:30:00</td></tr></table>
