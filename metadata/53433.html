A moving truck arrives with everything that was in Michelle's apartment in Vegas, including things that were not hers, as her landlord packed for her. Not having enough space for the things to be nicely put away, Michelle shoves them into the guesthouse and goes to sleep. Fanny wakes up Michelle in the middle of the night to talk and help her unpack and agrees to let Michelle &quot;borrow&quot; her stove, as the kitchen in the guest house does not function. The next morning, Michelle gets caught eating chips and soda in her underwear by some of the ballet students.

'Bunheads' is the tale of Michelle Simms, a former ballerina 'bunhead' who wound up as a Las Vegas showgirl. Seeing her life and career at a dead end, she impulsively takes up the offer of marriage from her persistent admirer, Hubbell Flowers (played by Alan Ruck), and moves to his sleepy coastal town, the fictional town of Paradise in Southern California, thirty miles south of Ojai, California.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Dance, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-04-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:00:00</td></tr></table>
