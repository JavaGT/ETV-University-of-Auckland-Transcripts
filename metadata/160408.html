About series:
He&rsquo;s a long way from the truth.

University lecturer Jonah Mulray&rsquo;s world is turned upside down when his wife Megan, a high-ranking international development worker, is killed in a car accident on a mountain road outside Hong Kong.

Overcoming his fear of flying, Jonah jets out from London to identify the body. Alone in an unsettling alien environment, given the run-around by overworked and underpaid local cops and haphazardly assisted by the British Consulate, Jonah discovers that the accident is not all it seems. Megan had been living a dangerous double life that left her exposed to sinister business interests. A web of conspiracy deepens as the evidence points to murder.
