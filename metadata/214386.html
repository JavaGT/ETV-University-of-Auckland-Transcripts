Antonio Stradivarius was, arguably, the greatest violin maker of them all, producing instruments that violinists today still treasure for their warm, generous tone. Each one, however, is entirely different, and here we get the unique opportunity to examine the sound of 12 of Stradivarius&rsquo; masterpieces. Some have not been played for decades&mdash;some, perhaps, never even recorded before. Violinist Janine Jansen and pianist Antonio Pappano have curated a program to accompany each one, their choices reflecting each instrument&rsquo;s historic owners as much as the character of the violin itself. So, a 1717 Stradivarius once played by Englishman Edward Tyrrell is showcased by Elgar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sospiri&rdquo; while Rachmaninoff is chosen for an instrument once cherished by Russian-American virtuoso Nathan Milstein. It&rsquo;s a fascinating, beautifully programmed, and stunningly performed experiment.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:50:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Entertainment, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Art, Careers, Design, German, History, Italian, Languages, Leadership, Media Studies, Music, Sociology, Technology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-09-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
