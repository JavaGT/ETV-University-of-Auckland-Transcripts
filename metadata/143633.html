Will it be enough to turn off tourists? Will it or should it spread to other New Zealand cities? Should tourists contribute to the infrastructure needed to service their needs? Should we perhaps have a tourist tax? A $50 charge for entering the country? What about charging for our walking tracks?

FORGET PARIS: US President Donald Trump has decided to give the fingers to the Paris Climate Agreement deal, leaving more than 190 countries to join Nicaragua and Syria in their dissent. Never mind that following the agreement is voluntary or that no changes will be able to happen until 2020. What difference will America&rsquo;s departure have on Climate Change? What impact does that have on what New Zealand will do to reduce our carbon emissions? And will Bill English and Gerry Brownlee talk tough with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson this week?

DAIRY DANGERS: New Zealand&rsquo;s dairy owners are under siege from robbers who are looking to loot them for money and cigarettes. The Government has promised $1.8m for robbery prevention measures: panic alarms, DNA spray, fog cannons, time safes. Is this the right move? Or does this put the onus on dairy owners? Should we stop the sale of cigarettes in dairies? But given this is a big part of their income&mdash;is that fair? What can we do to protect our small business owners?

About the Series:
Where else in the world would you find politicians brave enough to put themselves on camera in front of a live pub audience to debate the political issues facing their constituents? Only in New Zealand.

Like the iconic Backbencher pub where it is filmed, New Zealand&rsquo;s unique political programme, Back Benches, rises from the ashes to return to Prime Television. Back Benches is a perfect brew of politicians, a live and lively audience and hosts Wallace Chapman &amp; Charlotte Ryan. The big issues of the week are debated, not in the high-falutin&rsquo; manner of other political shows, but instead Back Benches attempts to demystify the world of New Zealand politics by bringing the beehive the barstools. It&rsquo;s politics with a pint! Back Benches delivers politics for real people in a format that&rsquo;s relaxed, funny and highly informative. It&rsquo;s a roller coaster ride of good-hearted foot-in-mouth moments from the country&rsquo;s politicians, along with genuine insight into how they feel and think about the issues facing the country.

Located across the street from Parliament, the Backbencher Pub, reopened after, not one, but two fires. The pub is the haunt of politicians, lobbyists, and political junkies alike. Which makes it the perfect home for Back Benches. Filmed on Wednesday evenings in front of a live audience, each episode features a panel of MPs representing the Government and Opposition getting a grilling from host Wallace Chapman. Charlotte Ryan gets the real deal from the punters in the audience and our collection of special guests and invited experts.
While the Backbencher Pub, a favourite Wellington local, has a new look, Back Benches is the same show with some fresh touches. Audience favourites&mdash;the News Wrap (the fastest and funniest way to catch on what&rsquo;s been happening in the news in the last week) and Real People (where we hit the streets to ask you what you think on a topic) remain, while there are surprises in store for new and old Back Benches fans.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-06-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:35:00</td></tr></table>
