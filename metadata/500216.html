The Air Training Corp gives them this opportunity and an education that they hope will be useful after the war as well. The young trainees learn about radios and the guns they'll use in the RNZAF fighter planes. 02.25 Vella Lavella, Jetty Builders: On the island of Vella Lavella, engineers from the 3rd Kiwi Division are building a jetty so that stores and equipment can be landed for the occupying troops. 03.40 Artists in Uniform: A exhibition touring NZ features amateur drawings and paintings done by men and women in the armed forces serving at home, in the Pacific and in the Middle East. Official war artist Russell Clark comments on the pictures. He says artists are considered to be 'a group apart' in New Zealand but actually they aren't as &quot;crazy&quot; as many people think. These are important documentary records in New Zealand's military history.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Engineering, History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
