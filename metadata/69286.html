Meet the real person behind the public image in - 'The Life And Times Of Temuera Morrison'. Temuera Morrison is part of New Zealand's first family of entertainment. Nephew to Sir Howard Morrison, show business has always been in Tem's blood. Since earning national fame as Dr Ropata on Shortland Street, Tem won international acclaim as Jake the Muss in 'Once Were Warriors', and achieved sci-fi cult status as an intergalactic bounty hunter in the 'Star Wars' series. With roles alongside Hollywood greats such as Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford and Sandra Bullock, Tem's star was flying high, until the acting jobs dried up and times started to get tough. 'The Life And Times Of Temuera Morrison' shows Tem at home in Rotorua, overseas, engaging with whanau, friends, film makers and fans.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:44</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Drama, Maori, Media Studies, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-11-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
