Jackson (Johnathon Schaech) and Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) are in love and about to have their first child when they move in with Jackson's mother, Martha (Jessica Lange), in order to take care of the family estate. But all is not well in this household. Martha is jealous of her son's affection for Helen, and, despite her Southern smile, she's starting to act strangely.
