We meet nurse Bea Smith at a military hospital in Alexandria. At the same hospital is her lecturer from Otago Medical School where she was studying to become a doctor. A scandal ended her chance to become a doctor and she became a nurse and then off to war.

Manaaki's Letter
This episode begins in Egypt with Manaaki writing his letter and moves to the landings at Gallipoli. Flashbacks to Auckland touch on tribal lands and the feelings of the Māori about the war.

Focuses on the impact the war has on a middle New Zealand, Pakeha family and a Māori brother and sister. This spectacular drama cuts between life at home, Gallipoli and Egypt. The series begins in a time of optimism and hope, on the eve of war. New Zealand has one of the highest living standards in the world, is part of the mighty British Empire and few can foresee the horrors soon to come.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:04:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, History, Maori, New Zealand, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-04-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
