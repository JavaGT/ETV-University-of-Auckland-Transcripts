Misfits are people who live outside of their cultural norms. Some are born into that situation, while others seek it. Meet Dave, an Australian man convinced his right leg didn't belong on his body, so he deliberately froze it beyond recovery, forcing doctors to amputate. In Bangladesh, river nomads make their living with snake charming and traditional healing. Viewed as sorcerers and sham artists by many, they are shunned and often not welcome on land.

Taboo takes you on a journey beyond the comfort zones and across cultural borders to explore rituals and customs that are acceptable in some cultures, but forbidden, illegal or, reviled in others. Understand seemingly bizarre and shocking practices from around the world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-08-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>04:30:00</td></tr></table>
