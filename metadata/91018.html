Mary Ledbetter is a woman who rules her small town with an iron fist. She's the local gossip and a full time agitator and a day in her company will test David Farrier's patience to the limit.

About Short Poppies:
Short Poppies is, at its core a comedy that pays homage to the traditions of New Zealand television as much as to the New Zealand people. Filmed in the style of a current affairs spoof Short Poppies is a series of day-in-the-life exclusive interview sessions with seven unique kiwi characters.

Each week respected journalist David Farrier spends a day with an ʻordinaryʼ person of New Zealand. The sort of person that wouldnʼt normally get their time in the lime light. Itʼs about giving the ʻeveryman and womanʼ their chance to be in the spotlight.

Think Country Calendar, and the heartwarmingly earnest colour pieces of journalism that featured in the early days of television. But with the Darby twist. 

Rhys Darby has created seven extraordinarily ordinary New Zealand characters that sit perilously close to real life. They expose all the foibles and the endearing flaws of people just like us in towns just like ours all over the country.

Remember what John Clarke did with the Fred Dagg interviews in the mid 1970s? Now in 2014 we get the chance to see Rhys lovingly play homage to one of his comic heroes and this comedic genre.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:35</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:10:00</td></tr></table>
