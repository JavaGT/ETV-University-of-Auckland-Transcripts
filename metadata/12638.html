This hard edged documentary series rides the waves alongside the fishermen for eight weeks. The show reports the jeopardy and drama - the success and failure - and the compelling man versus sea story for the audience. This job is not only risky but it also has the extra pressure of an unforgiving schedule. The fishermen have a short season and the clock is always ticking. They must catch as many loads as possible before the end of another crayfish season.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-02-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
