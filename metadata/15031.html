But his most revealing constructions are his houses, revolutionary in their open plan design, and conceived as an expression of Wright's philosophy of a perfect harmony between man and nature: 'organic architecture' as he called it. Wright's houses also embody an ideal for living based on calmness and order, but his own life was characterised by public scandal, financial chaos and personal tragedy. The American icon behind the Guggenheim museum, Fallingwater and his own home, Taliesin, Frank Lloyd Wright became the greatest architect of the 20th century - not only because of his magnificent talent but because he was a master showman and self-publicist. This BBC documentary explores Lloyd Wright's visionary works and reveals how his life was beset with periods of devastating critical derision, financial chaos, scandal, and a violent but little-known murder.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Architecture, Art, Design, History, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>07:30:00</td></tr></table>
