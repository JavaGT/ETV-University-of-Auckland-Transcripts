At its heart it's about your job, your children's education, your parent's healthcare, how much tax you pay and what it means to be a New Zealander. It's about the people who write the rules and get to decide what kind of country our children will inherit. That's what Q and A is about. We're here to ask those people the questions you want covered, and to draw out answers that reveal their real agenda. It's because politics matters so much that it should never be dull.
