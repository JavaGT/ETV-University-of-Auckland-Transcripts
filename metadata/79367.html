In 1951 and in front of thousands of onlookers, William Red Hill Jr. set out in his barrel which consisted of 13 inner tubes held together with fish net and canvas straps.  His barrel was called &quot;The Thing&quot;. He was the first person in 21 years to attempt to go over the Horseshoe Falls but sadly the barrel started to disintegrate before it even went over the falls. Hill lost his life.
