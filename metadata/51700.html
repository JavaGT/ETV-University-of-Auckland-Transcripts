Complications arise as the Sons band together to face a new adversary.

Sons of Anarchy is an adrenalized drama with darkly comedic undertones that explores a notorious outlaw motorcycle club's (MC) desire to protect its livelihood while ensuring that their simple, sheltered town of Charming, California remains exactly that, Charming. The MC must confront threats from drug dealers, corporate developers, and overzealous law officers. Behind the MC's familial lifestyle and legally thriving automotive shop is a ruthless and illegally thriving arms business. The seduction of money, power, and blood.
Jackson 'Jax' Teller (Charlie Hunnam) is the MC s vice-president who is tested by his growing apprehension for its lawlessness, Gemma Teller Morrow (Katey Sagal) is Jax' force-of-nature mother, and Clarence  Clay  Morrow (Ron Perlman) is Jax' stepfather and MC president. The triangle of Mother, Son, and Stepfather will ultimately reveal the dark secrets in this family's past and the lengths they will go to protect their sins.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
