About the Series:
You Can't Ask That is about breaking down stereotypes and offering genuine insight into the experiences of people who live with labels. The series asks groups of misunderstood, judged or marginalised Australians the awkward, inappropriate or uncomfortable questions you've always wanted to know the answers to, but always been too afraid to ask.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:22:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-04-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
