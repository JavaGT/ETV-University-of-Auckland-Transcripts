It&rsquo;s Friday night and it&rsquo;s been a big week. There&rsquo;s been stupid news, big news, unbelievable news and news about us right here in New Zealand. Then come Jeremy Corbett and two teams of New Zealand&rsquo;s finest comic talent to blast the news out of the water, dissect it, lambast each other and have a brilliant time while doing it.

This is 7 Days, a Friday night comedy satire show where our best stand-up comedians aren&rsquo;t afraid to do what they do best &ndash; take the piss out of everything, but mostly all the news of the week and each other.

The news changes every week, but 7 Days is staying refreshingly the same. Well ok, we're shooting in a brand new studio, and yes we'll be playing some brand new games, and granted there are new comedians from here and overseas chomping at the bit to come and dissect the news on 7 Days, but apart from that, exactly the same. The same Jeremy Corbett at the helm, with the same lovable team leaders Dai Henwood and Paul Ego, along with some increasingly familiar characters like Ben Hurley, Steve Wrigley, Jeremy Elwood, Michele A'Court and Cori Gonzalez Macuer.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:33:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, New Zealand, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2016-10-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
