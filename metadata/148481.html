For the Native American Iroquois nations, or Haudenosaunee, lacrosse is central to their cultural heritage and a fundamental means of honouring the earth&rsquo;s creator. Twelfth century indigenous Americans developed the game to sharpen their hunting skills and strengthen the mind and body. Today, Native American athletes are among the sport's top players.
