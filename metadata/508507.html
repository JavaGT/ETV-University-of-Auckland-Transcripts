How are broadcasters handling staff sharing opinions online?

The BBC has reversed its suspension of presenter Gary Lineker following a weekend of chaos at the broadcaster.

Lineker was initially suspended after he described the government&rsquo;s migration plan as &ldquo;immeasurably cruel&rdquo; and said the government&rsquo;s language was &ldquo;not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s&rdquo;.

The BBC reinstated Lineker following a major backlash over the decision to remove him for sharing a political opinion.

The BBC has promised to hold a review of its own guidelines, amid questions over impartiality and political influence.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-03-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:30:00</td></tr></table>
