Most of the crew have been killed by their smartsuits, robotic spacesuits capable of independent movement which are the only source of oxygen on the station, forcing the TARDIS crew to don spares. The suits received an order to &quot;deactivate organic components&quot;; some crew survived by being disconnected, but networked suits can transmit the command by touch. Bill's suit malfunctions, forcing the Doctor to give her his helmet to save her, exposing himself to the vacuum of space, which blinds him; he later leaves her behind to be electrocuted, knowing her suit hasn't the power for a lethal shock. The algorithm used by the company determined the crew were inefficient and thus too expensive to keep alive. He wires the survivors' life signs to the station so that if they die it will explode, making it more expensive to kill them, so the suits give over their remaining oxygen. Bill is revived, the Doctor's eyes are repaired, and the survivors return to their head office to complain. Back at the university, the Doctor reveals to Nardole he is still blind.
