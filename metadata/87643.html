The Doctor and Rose go to New Earth, the planet which humanity inhabited after the Earth's destruction by the Sun. They go into a hospital in New New York, where Rose meets the villain Cassandra (Zo&euml; Wanamaker) again. Cassandra possesses Rose's body as she is in need of one, but the Doctor is suspicious of &quot;Rose&quot;'s actions. They discover that the hospital holds hundreds of artificially-grown humans that have been infected with diseases so the Sisters of Plenitude can find their cures. &quot;Rose&quot; releases several of the humans as a distraction, but they release others and a zombie-like attack begins. The Doctor sprays the infected humans with the solution from a disinfectant shower, curing them. The Doctor orders Cassandra out of Rose and she transfers her consciousness to her servant Chip (Sean Gallagher), but his cloned body fails and Cassandra accepts her death.

'Doctor Who' is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC from 1963 to the present day. The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord - a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-08-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:00:00</td></tr></table>
