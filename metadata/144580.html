Dan examines how the Viking expanded first as raiders, then settlers and traders throughout Britain and beyond to Iceland and Greenland; discovering that they aren't just the Hells Angels of the Medieval world - rapacious raiders of legend - but shrewd entrepreneurs and inventors. Dan researches how the Vikings became advanced in metal production, receiving a lesson in period iron production, as he is taught how the Viking forged their own nails. 

Dan then explores how the Vikings voyaged thousands of miles when most ships never left the shoreline by learning how they sailed and navigated on an exact replica of an 11th Century Viking ship. 

And finally in North America Dan and Sarah excavate what could be the most westerly Viking settlement ever discovered. Can they prove that the Vikings did really settle in the New World 500 years before Columbus?

Unravel the mysteries of a great empire.

For 500 years the Vikings forged an empire through ocean exploration and bloody conquest. They survived harsh climates, pushed the boundaries of human exploration and even discovered America 500 years before Columbus. How did they achieve such great successes? And why, at the height of their powers, did they suddenly disappear from many of their territories?

Archaeologist Sarah Parcak travels from the east coast of Scotland to Iceland, Greenland and North America to unlock the secrets of the vast Viking Empire. Combining specialist satellite imagery of archaeological sites with the latest DNA and forensic science, she pieces together the fascinating evidence about this fearless civilisation.
