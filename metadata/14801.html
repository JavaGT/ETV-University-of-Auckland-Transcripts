They have been forced up by the mighty inner forces of the planet, but are worn down by the forces of wind and flowing water and ice, and by the greatest force of all - time. And we have been fascinated too by those creatures which live in the mountains, at the very edge of creation. 
 On the Japanese island of Honshu the mountain spine which runs along it are also known as the Alps. The South Island of New Zealand is also known for its Alps, which dominate the west coast and are the youngest of the world?s Alpine regions. But the oldest Alps of all are found in Australia. Just a remnant now of what they once were, but a reminder of how mountains also fade away with the inevitable passing of time. 
 Wolves are returning to the European Alps, otters hunt in the fast flowing rivers and the mighty golden eagle soars above its peaks. On the rocky precipices Ibex and Chamoix live precarious lives, perhaps forced to move to the extremes by the predators which once hunted them, and may yet again.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ANIMAL PLANET</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>07:30:00</td></tr></table>
