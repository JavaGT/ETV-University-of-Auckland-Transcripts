<tr><td align='left' valign='top'>etv/retreat_bbc_knowledge_20111225_0720_640x360</td><td  align='left' valign='top'>The Retreat - Episode 2</td><td align='left' valign='top'>After last week's gentle introduction to this observational series about an Islamic retreat in southern Spain, and the six people spending time there searching for spiritual enlightenment, things start to hot up. They're an amiable bunch, but as their different personalities emerge, so does the friction between them. It's becoming clear that Muddassar is resisting the whole experience, refusing to disengage from life back in the UK until he's almost surgically removed from his mobile phone. Aisha, meanwhile, has such a prescriptive take on Islam that she spends her entire time pursing her lips in a disapproving fashion. But top moment goes to agnostic Simon, who's so rational about everything that he's struggling to engage with his mystical, spiritual side. Just as he's explaining to the camera why he thinks he didn't need to visit the retreat to get religion, there's an almighty crack of thunder that has him (laughingly) begging for forgiveness.

This series allows viewers an inside look at the genuine spiritual side of Islam. Four British men and four British women leave their lives behind to embark on a life-changing journey.
