It also effected Iziyah's eyes and he can't see things far away or too close up. Iziyah is a bit of a superstar, just give him a mic and he'll sing all day. When it comes to being pranked, Shakti really shouldn't look away for too long or he'll find himself stranded!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:32</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-04-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:07:00</td></tr></table>
