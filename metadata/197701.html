Take a look at the LIDAR and integrated photonics technologies that help self-driving cars navigate obstacles, no matter the environment, weather or light.

It&rsquo;s late, pitch dark and a self-driving car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear at the same time. With no human at the wheel, the car uses smart eyes, sensors that&rsquo;ll resolve these details all in a split-second. How is this possible? Sajan Saini explains how LIDAR and integrated photonics technology make self-driving cars a reality.
