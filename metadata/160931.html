About series:
ITM Hook Me Up! is back! World-renowned extreme fisherman Matt Watson hooks up ten lucky Kiwis with the fishing trip of their dreams and puts them in situations they never thought they would handle. From battling big fish from the shore, to fishing in open waters and even under the ocean, right in front of some huge ocean predators. 

The show takes fishing enthusiasts out of the armchair and puts them right alongside Matt to do the same kind of outrageous fishing feats he&rsquo;s known for, and even a few things he&rsquo;s never tried before. 

The characters and emotions are very real as they experience the highs and lows of trying to catch the fish of their dreams. Like the father and daughter that had been trying to catch a marlin together for eight years, only to reel in ten each on their first day on ITM Hook Me Up!

The new season boasts catches and footage that Matt Watson claims to be the very best in his career, and there&rsquo;s something in it for everyone and not a single dull moment.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, New Zealand, Social Studies, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-03-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
