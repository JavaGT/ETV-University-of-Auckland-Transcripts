About series:
Based on the Letty Dobesh books by Blake Crouch, the seductive thriller &quot;Good Behavior&quot; centers on con artist Letty Raines and her inability -- despite good intentions -- to consistently live a clean life. Fresh out of prison, Letty attempts to reunite with her 10-year-old son and keep in regular contact with her parole officer, whose motives for helping her are questionable. But after she overhears a hit man being hired to kill a man's wife, Letty sets out to derail the job and finds herself on a collision course with the killer, entangling herself in a dangerous and seductive relationship.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:46:12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, Literature, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-06-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
