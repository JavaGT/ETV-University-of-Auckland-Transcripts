In this episode, we look at why Gen Z around the world are broke and whether they deserve the bad reputation for their lifestyle choices.
Gen Z are struggling financially. A 2023 survey of Gen Z in 44 countries suggested that around half of them were living paycheck to paycheck and almost half needed a side job. So why are Gen Z broke?

&ldquo;Gen Z spends all their money on avocado toast and coffee and all they do is sit on social media and they don&rsquo;t wanna work&rdquo; &ndash; or such is the perception of the financial woes afflicting Gen Z. Studies show that Gen Z are the generation least likely to have savings or a plan for the future when it comes to money &ndash; but the &ldquo;doomers&rdquo; also report very little hope in the future.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-05-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
