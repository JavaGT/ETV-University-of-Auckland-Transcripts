Russia and Wagner now appear to be at odds, with reports suggesting Putin&rsquo;s government is no longer funding the group.
Russia is said to have stopped funding the Wagner Group of mercenaries after its attempted mutiny in June.

For years, Russia had denied the existence of the group, let alone associated itself with it.

That&rsquo;s despite multiple reports revealing the group&rsquo;s involvement in promoting Moscow&rsquo;s interests in Syria and several African countries.

The Wagner chief&rsquo;s failed mutiny in June has further shed light on what was likely a strong connection between the two sides.

But Russia and Wagner now appear to be at odds, with reports suggesting President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s government is no longer funding the group.

So where does that leave the two parties? And is there a risk the Wanger Group might turn against the Kremlin?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-08-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:30:00</td></tr></table>
