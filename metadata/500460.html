The purpose of this workshop is to present some research Stella has been doing on Vocational Pathways. Firstly an analysis has been conducted to map what proportional breakdown exists within the Vocational Pathways when viewed across the Learning Areas. Leaver data has also been mapped alongside the Vocational Pathways to identify what pathways leavers follow. A detailed analysis of what sector related standards her school offers across the Learning Areas is outlined. Research has been done on job prospects nationally, again mapped against the Vocational Pathways. This has then been repeated at a regional level using data for Taranaki.
The consideration behind the research is focused on providing opportunities for all learners to potentially secure Vocational Pathway Awards regardless of their destination beyond school.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:38:38</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-08-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:42:58</td></tr></table>
