In a forgotten corner of Northern England, Vinnie and his mates are stone-broke. Driven to a life of petty crime, Vinnie, Dylan, Cardi, Ash, Tommo and JJ's friendship has stood the test of time, but the cracks are beginning to show. When Dylan's girlfriend Erin wants out to start afresh in a new town, Dylan is torn between following her or staying with the pals he thinks of as brothers. As their past indiscretions begin to catch up with them and the realisation hits that they are getting in way over their heads, the boys need each other now more than ever.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:43:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-12-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
