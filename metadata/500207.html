Thousands mark the occasion in Wellington with a huge parade. The Governor General Sir Cyril Newall proclaims the end of the European War. But there is still a victory to be won in the Pacific as acting Prime Minister Walter Nash tells the assembled thousands at the National Ceremony. They respond with a rousing version of God Defend New Zealand.  A Peace Parade is held down the main street of Otahuhu in Auckland and in Christchurch the clowns come out to play. Everyone exuberantly celebrates the 'better day tomorrow' that's finally arrived. An artillery salute makes the biggest noise and Timaru ends the day with a bonfire - victory in a blaze of glory.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
