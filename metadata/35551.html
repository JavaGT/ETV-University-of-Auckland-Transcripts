His journey starts at a West Auckland church, where he meets bride and groom-to-be, Emma Sione and Albert Omlang, with their wedding celebrant, Pastor Chris Sululoto.

Simon heads to Samoa, to the island of Upolu on a whistle-stop research trip.  He visits the famous Apia market, where he samples the local produce, drinks kava and stumbles across a delicious Samoan dish, palusami, made from taro leaves and coconut cream.
Returning to Auckland knowing a lot more about Samoan cuisine than he did a few days earlier, Simon travels to Otahuhu to meet the wedding's caterer, can Simon produce a feast to remember?  Or will it be a nightmare they never forget?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-09-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:28:00</td></tr></table>
