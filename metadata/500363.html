Even in the low temperatures of the Arctic and Antarctic it is always close to its melting point, making its behaviour unpredictable and our understanding of it poor. The seasonal change in the extent of sea ice around the margins of Antarctica is one of the greatest annual geophysical changes on Earth, making sea ice a rapidly responding indicator of climate change. &lt;br&gt;Sea ice is never completely solid - there is always some very salty liquid (called brine) trapped within it. At Otago University, researchers are interested in the processes that trap this liquid, then cause it to be forced through the ice and finally expel it back into the sea. The presence of this brine is important because it influences the sea ice strength, its ability to absorb heat, and the interaction that the sea ice has with the ocean underneath it. The brine also provides a mechanism for moving around the tiny living organisms that live in the sea ice. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Patricia Langhorne, senior lecture in Physics, Chris Petric, post-doctoral researcher in Physics and Craig Purdie, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Otago.
