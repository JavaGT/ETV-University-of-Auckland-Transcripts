Milner and DCS Meredith (Foyle's replacement) have arrested a racketeer, but this has to take a back-seat when a highly-strung map-maker is found hanged in local woods, after confiding in a local Catholic priest (a German, but apparently anti-Nazi). It looks like suicide but Milner is not so sure. Threatened by the racketeer, Milner is the subject of an attempted assassination, which instead leaves Meredith dead. Foyle is reluctantly called back from retirement to solve both the cases, which he successfully does, and decides to stay in police work until the end of the war.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:34:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, English, History, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:40:00</td></tr></table>
