Paula Jones, a West Auckland mother of three, was busy preparing to leave for a new life abroad, when she was struck down by a horrible mystery illness that left her paralysed from the waist down.

Paula - a TV documentary director - went from able-bodied to disabled in less than two hours.

The illness caused her once highly-organised life to unravel, leaving her angry but determined to walk again.

Paula set out to discover if there was anyone in the world who could come up with a cure.

'The Day My Legs Stopped Working,' is a year-long account of Paula's struggle to get out of a wheelchair and back to something approaching normality.

It's a journey into the world of stem cell therapy and right to the edge of current medical ethics.

Paula takes major leaps of faith, including a final excursion to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to complete a documentary project on child relief in a desperate place.

&quot;This is one brave woman,&quot; says documentary director, Rob Harley. &quot;Paula is overcoming major odds to strive for some kind of physical normality</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, New Zealand, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:05:00</td></tr></table>
