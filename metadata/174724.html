Exploring the political legacies of six former Māori MPs, Matangireia features key interviews with Dame Tariana Turia, Metiria Turei, Sandra Lee, Tuariki Delemere, Tau Henare and Marama Fox. The series is hosted by acclaimed political writer and commentator Morgan Godfery. Matangireira takes its name from Parliament&rsquo;s former Māori Affairs Committee room, which was built in 1922. It is also the location where the series was filmed.

The series provides frank and sometimes surprising insights into the most challenging moments of six political careers, with the former politicians opening-up about their darkest days and their moments of triumph. They also discuss the difficulties of transitioning to life after politics.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, History, Maori, Media Studies, New Zealand, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata Māori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-12-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
