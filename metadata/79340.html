Paco Rabanne Metal Dresses and 1969 Fashion. The Franco-Spanish designer originally worked for Christian Dior, Balenciaga and Givenchy before establishing his own label in 1966. This rather groovey British Path&eacute; video was recorded three years afterwards, evidently Paco Rabanne was by this point considered a member of high fashion's inner circle. Famous for his metal dresses, worn by Twiggy and Grace Jones in the 1960s, and which are still worn by celebrities today, Rabanne used many novel material such as plastic and paper. Today Paco Rabanne is perhaps best known for his male aftershaves and scents.
