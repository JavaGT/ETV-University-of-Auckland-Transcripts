Nanotechnology is a new technology based on the manipulation of individual atoms to form structures and devices that have new and unusual different properties. &lt;br&gt; IRL has worked for several years with a Christchurch-based company, Nanocluster Devices Ltd, which  builds devices such as nanowires from nanoparticles. The key aspect of the technology is that nanowires can be self-assembled between electrical contacts without the time consuming and expensive manipulation that typically hinders the production of nanodevices. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Shaun Hendy, a Research Scientist at IRL and a Senior Lecturer at Victoria University</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
