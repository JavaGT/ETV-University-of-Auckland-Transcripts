IMPORTANT: you will need one adult with a sense of scientific wonder....

What you need to get started is: a bucket, a large bag of ice, a thermometer, 500 grams of salt and a 500ml bottle of water.

1. Pour your large bag of ice into your bucket
2. Cover your ice in 400 grams of salt
3. Squash in 3 bottles of water into your ice leaving the tops uncovered
4. If you have a thermometer it would be useful to put this in now
5. Leave to cool for 15 minutes and check your thermometer (anything below -6 degrees Celsius and your good to go)
6. Now carefully lift one of your bottles out and bash it off a table/work surface and let stand
7. Now sit back and watch the Instant Ice form
8. If it doesn't form leave you 2 remaining bottles to cool for a while longer and have another go.
