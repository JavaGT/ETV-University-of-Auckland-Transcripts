In their heyday, the RSA was the cornerstone of small towns across Aotearoa.

These days, on a drive through our backcountry, you&rsquo;ll see RSAs that are relics of their former glory. Some are falling apart and on the brink of closure, while others have been forced to reinvent themselves to remain relevant and therefore survive.

In Te pā ika a whiro &ndash; Tāmati&rsquo;s RSA Roadie, presenter Tāmati Rimene-Sproat takes a pilgrimage across Aotearoa, to meet the people that are keeping these places alive, capture precious wartime korero, and pose the question &ndash; what is the future for our esteemed RSA&rsquo;s?
