Three days later, Sandra was found hanging from a noose in her jail cell. Though ruled a suicide, her death sparked allegations of racially-motivated police murder and Sandra became a poster child for activists nationwide, leaving millions to question, &ldquo;What really happened to Sandra Bland?&rdquo;

Ten days after Sandra's death, filmmakers, Kate Davis and David Heilbroner began working closely with the family's legal team, tracking the two-year battle between Sandra's aggrieved family and Texas authorities. With disturbing, never-before-told details about the case, the film is punctuated by Sandra&rsquo;s own passionate and moving commentary.

Approximately 30 &ldquo;Sandy Speaks&rdquo; video blogs, which Sandra created herself, allowed the filmmakers to get to know Sandra Bland in a deeply personal way. Via these videos, Sandy herself emerges as a central voice in Say Her Name &mdash; an empowered, enlightened woman of color whose sharp, humorous, charismatic remarks address subjects from educating kids about black history to police brutality to the importance of natural hair.
