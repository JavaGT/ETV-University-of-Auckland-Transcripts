Comedian Mohammed Amer&rsquo;s new Netflix series &ldquo;Mo&rdquo; is bringing the Palestinian experience to the masses. The program was inspired by some of the challenges the 41-year-old Palestinian-American has faced in his own life, including losing his father at a young age, moving from the Middle East to Texas and navigating the complex U.S. immigration system as a refugee.

So far, &ldquo;Mo&rdquo; has gotten a blockbuster reception from fans and a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes from television critics who say the show is &ldquo;frequently hilarious&rdquo; and a &ldquo;thoughtful depiction of the immigrant experience that is light on its feet.&rdquo; It has also been lauded by the Palestinian community for humanising the frequently marginalised group in a way that is not &ldquo;trauma porn.&rdquo;

In a recent interview, Amer explained one reason behind Mo&rsquo;s success: &ldquo;The subject matter is absolutely universal. It&rsquo;s not just for refugees, asylees. It&rsquo;s for anybody that wants to fit in, that feels like they have to work four jobs at a time to provide for their family, who are losing themselves spiritually&hellip;It&rsquo;s for those individuals that feel like less than, that wish they could provide more for their families.&rdquo;

In this episode of The Stream, we&rsquo;ll talk to Mohammed Amer about the show&rsquo;s groundbreaking depiction of an ordinary Palestinian American family, how he strikes a balance with the many facets of his identity and why chocolate hummus is a &ldquo;war crime.&rdquo;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-12-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
