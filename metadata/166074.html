About series:
The feeling you&rsquo;ve been searching for your entire life.

Euphoria puts a fresh spin on the coming-of-age narrative, exploring the teenage landscape of substance-enhanced parties and anxiety-ridden day-to-day life with empathy and candour. The series follows 17-year-old Rue Bennett, a drug addict fresh from rehab, who&rsquo;s struggling to make sense of her future. Her life changes dramatically when she meets Jules Vaughn, a girl who recently moved to town following her parents&rsquo; divorce, and like Rue is searching for where she belongs.

Also in Rue&rsquo;s orbit are classmates Nate Jacobs, a jock whose anger issues mask his insecurities; Maddy Perez, Nate&rsquo;s on- and off-again girlfriend; Chris McKay, a football star who finds the adjustment from high school to college harder than expected; Cassie Howard, whose sexual history continues to dog her; Lexi Howard, Cassie&rsquo;s younger sister and Rue&rsquo;s level-headed childhood friend; and Kat Hernandez, a body-conscious teen exploring her sexuality.
