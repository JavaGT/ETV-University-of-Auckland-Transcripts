Injustice is a five-part psychological thriller from acclaimed writer Anthony Horowitz (Collision, Foyle&rsquo;s War). This event drama tackles a universal question...indeed it&rsquo;s at the heart of every country&rsquo;s legal system.
 
How does a defence barrister live with himself if he finds out that his client is guilty? William Travers (James Purefoy) is just such a man. Famous for defending the underdog, he is recovering from a nervous breakdown and the complete uprooting of his family and his work. When we meet him, he is working on low-level cases in rural Suffolk. His life is thrown off balance a second time when he happens to see a figure from the past across a station platform.

At the same time, an old university friend asks him to defend him for a murder he swears he didn&rsquo;t do. Travers finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that stretches far beyond the courtroom while fighting off the forces that may once again destroy him.

Injustice is a complex, nail-biting drama... an examination of morality on many levels. STARRING: James Purefoy (Camelot, Diamonds, Rome, Frankenstein), Dervla Kirwan (The Silence, Material Girl, Law &amp; Order UK) Charlie Creed-Miles (Criminal Justice, Five Days, Skins) and Nat Parker (Lewis, My Family, Land Girls, Hotel Babylon).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Law, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-11-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
