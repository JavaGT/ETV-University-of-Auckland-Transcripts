About series:
Award-winning historian and broadcaster Bettany Hughes presents a new eight-part landmark history of ancient Rome. Across the series Hughes explores eight key days that she believes define the Roman Empire and help us to understand its remarkable success. In each episode, Hughes travels across the Roman world, delving into the psyche and uncovering brand new archaeological evidence, while lavish drama brings the incredible story of Rome to life. The eight days include Rome&rsquo;s early defeat of her great rival Carthage under Hannibal, at the battle of Zama; a crucial moment and one of the most important battles in ancient history when Rome, an influential city-state becomes an unstoppable Empire. We also explore the day when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River and set in chain a series of events that would ultimately culminate in the end of Rome&rsquo;s republic. The final episode looks at the day Constantine, close to death, was finally baptised as a Christian. It was here he made a final declaration of the spiritual allegiance that had a profound importance not just for the Empire, but for the future of the world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, History, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-03-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
