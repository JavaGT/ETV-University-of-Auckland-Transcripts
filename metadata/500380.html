Current methods of bacterial spore detection, such as colony counting, require trained personnel for sampling and analysis. Here we report a method for the rapid detection and identification of bacterial spores using optical techniques. We have investigated methods for the rapid detection of bacterial spores. We use the natural fluorescence of the spores after irradiation with ultraviolet light to identify the spore. The components of the spore have strong fluorescence properties. This technique has additional medical applications: identifying the bacterium causing glue ear in an infant or as a fast strep test for a sore throat. There are also applications for food safety. We have been able to identify a small number of bacterial spores in milk powder.
