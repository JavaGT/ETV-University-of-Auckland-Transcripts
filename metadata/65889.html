Charlotte Kruk Kempken has delighted us with her wearable fashions made from hundreds of candy wrappers for years. Kruk collects innumerable wrappers and labels from a single sweet source, and defying the logic of consuming candy and modeling elegant fashions at the same time, she obsessively sews them all together and creates an astounding garment or gown. Charlotte then sews dresses and other outfits out of used candy wrappers Her crowning achievement is an M&amp;M Matador top Needless to say certain candy companies aren't so happy about her art. But I don't think she sees herself a threat to any copyrights, just as Andy Warhol celebrated Campbells' soups. At some recent exhibitions, delicious young artist-friends whose lovely figures seem untouched by eating excesses, have modeled them.
