A new weekly series on TVNZ 7, The Court Report is a current affairs programme focused entirely on the laws that keep New Zealand running, the cases that should be making news and precedents that are being set. As host, King brings his infamous style, intellect and wry humour to a topic that affects all Kiwis but isn't often discussed comprehensively or intelligently.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, New Zealand, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ7</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-12-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
