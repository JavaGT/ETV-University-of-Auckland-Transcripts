About the Series:
Starring Australia&rsquo;s Geoffrey Rush and from executive producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard comes National Geographic&rsquo;s first scripted anthology series, Genius. Witness as Rush stars as the brilliant Nobel- Prize winning physicist Albert Einstein who goes from an imaginative patent clerk, who couldn&rsquo;t get a doctorate to unlocking the mysteries of the atom and the universe. 

National Geographic presents Genius, the network&rsquo;s first-ever scripted series, based on the Walter Isaacson book Einstein: His Life and Universe and executive produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, with Howard also directing the first episode. 

The all-star cast includes Geoffrey Rush as Professor Einstein, Johnny Flynn as Albert in his youth and Emily Watson as the scientist&rsquo;s second wife &mdash; and first cousin &mdash; Elsa Einstein. 

Over 10 episodes, the series takes Einstein&rsquo;s story beyond the halls of academia to explore his struggles to be a good husband and father, and a man of principle during a period of global unrest. His daringly creative mind often landed him in trouble with his loved ones and peers, but also helped him to usher in groundbreaking discoveries that reshaped modern science.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Chemistry, History, Media Studies, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-05-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
