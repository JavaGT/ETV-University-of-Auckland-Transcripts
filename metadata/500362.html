Its activities are split into a study on industrial drying and one on improving energy efficiency in houses. &lt;br&gt; Because industrial drying is required for many products (e.g. vegetables, timber, sewage slurry, dairy products, meat waste) it places high demand on energy sources. The longest running project of the Otago group is the energy efficient drying of timber using a heat pump-based system.  &lt;br&gt; Other projects with potential for heat pump drying systems include: the drying of maize for seed production, drying of dairy products in a nitrogen atmosphere and techniques for drying paste-like materials in a heated plate drying system. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Gerry Carrington, Professor of Physics at the University of Otago and Michel van de Pal, a post-doctoral researcher in Physics at the University of Otago.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:04:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
