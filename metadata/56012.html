Well it turns out that Noah and I could do it!  I was a little surprised at how small the parameter space was to achieve a good series of bounces. Near the end of this clilp, you can see waves entering from the lower right. I think these are reflections of a low frequency sloshing modes set up by the initial droplet. The smallest droplet bounces off these waves and start moving off to the side.  In any case it is pretty cool. The only issue is that there was some dust on the sensor (dark spots that don't move). The camera is a Vision Research Phantom v7.3 high speed video camera.&quot;
