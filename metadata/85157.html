With the aid of her sarcastic best friend Alice (Zoe Lister Jones) and cute male best buddy Henry (Hamish Linklater), not to mention less than welcome advice from her trying-to-be-hip parents (Bill Pullman and Debra Winger), Lola tries to get back on her feet but she finds herself increasingly torn between being unable to let go of her feelings for Luke and a developing crush on Henry.
