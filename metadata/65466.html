Reese must protect the sister (Jessie Collins) of a soldier who died in Afghanistan and her boyfriend, an ex-Marine (Brian J. Smith) who lost his right arm, who are trying to expose an executive stealing from a charity for wounded vets. Carter is offered a temporary assignment to the FBI when Special Agent Donnelly returns with new clues he believes will lead to Reese. The situation gets complicated when Reese, for whom the case has become personal, puts himself at risk as the FBI closes in on him while Finch is unable to stop him. The episode concludes with the FBI arresting Reese as well as some thugs working for the crooked charity. Fusco, meanwhile, grows increasingly suspicious of Carter's boyfriend Cal Beecher, who is revealed to be the godson of HR leader Alonzo Quinn.
