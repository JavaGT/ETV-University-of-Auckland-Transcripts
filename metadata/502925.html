Jayne has passed on a lot of her cooking knowledge to Lauren, and they have very happy memories of spending time together in the kitchen. As a recent vegetarian, Lauren has been experimenting with new food over the last year and is hoping to learn something exciting from chef Jeremy Pang. Jayne would love to get some new fish recipes, as her husband is a keen fisherman and there is always some fish in the house. Paired with chef Romy Gill, she&rsquo;s sure to have plenty to take away from today. But who will win the day and take home the Ready Steady Cook hamper?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, Food Science, Health, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-08-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
