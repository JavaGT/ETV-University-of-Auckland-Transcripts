As time stretched on and the more that came (be it as free settlers or indentured labourers), they integrated into the culture, learnt the fa'asamoa, married Samoans, had Samoan families and eventually died in Samoa as Samoans.
The legacy they left behind is powerful and can be seen in the culture and the people of Samoa today.
Despite the history, the newest wave of Chinese to arrive in Samoa has upset a lot of the locals. Taking businesses that should be set aside for Locals, skirting laws set up to prevent them from doing so and funnelling money out of the Samoan economy, are just some of the issues being voiced by Samoans.
This documentary, 'Dragons In Paradise', delves into the history of the Chinese in Samoa and examines the potential consequences of the latest Chinese influx that is sweeping the Pacific.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:31:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Asian Studies, History, Media Studies, Pacifica, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-04-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:30:00</td></tr></table>
