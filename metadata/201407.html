About series:
Following the work of ambulance services around the UK, `Ambulance' is an unprecedented documentary series that delves into the dilemmas and pressures that British ambulance services face on a daily basis. Narrated by Christopher Eccleston, viewers are shown what day-to-day operations are like from the point of views of the people in the control rooms and the crews on the streets. With around 3000 people calling for paramedics every day, the cameras capture the cases from the initial first call to the arrival of the ambulance to what happens after.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:13:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Health, Psychology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-02-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
