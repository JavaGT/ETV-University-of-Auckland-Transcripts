In 1308 Pope Gregory IX enlists the Dominicans to root out and destroy a sect know as the Cathars which renounce all the rituals of the Catholicism in favor of simple spiritualism. This simple faith had great appeal to illiterate villagers who had little understanding of the Roman Catholic Church they belonged to. Thus begins the Inquisition.

'Secret Files of the Inquisition' describes the western world's most potent religion, Catholicism, and its determination to maintain power at any cost in medieval France, 15th century Spain, Renaissance Italy and even into the 19th century. Historians, experts and Church authorities advise on the handling of this controversial subject matter.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Political Studies, Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-12-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:30:00</td></tr></table>
