This summer Michaela Strachan is on a grand tour of its busiest wildlife parks, rescue centres and zoos. She joins forces with the most dedicated carers helping injured and threatened animals from Britain and beyond.&lt;br&gt;In each show, Michaela works with the animal carers at one specific centre - from Secret World, the busiest wildlife rescue centre in the South East, to Edinburgh Zoo, home to the only koalas in Britain. She comes face to face with a whole host of native and exotic animals - from injured badger cubs, foxes and deer fawns that naturally roam the great British countryside, to snakes, capuchin monkeys and pygmy hippos more often found at home in more exotic climes. She travels the length and breadth of Britain, uncovering the nations love for animals of all shapes and sizes, and she gets to know the keepers, carers and animal rescuers who go beyond the call of duty to protect native and exotic wildlife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-03-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:59:00</td></tr></table>
