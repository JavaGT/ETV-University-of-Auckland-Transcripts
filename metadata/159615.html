About series:
This drama series is based on Gerald Durrell's classic trilogy of Corfu memoirs and stars Keeley Hawes in the lead role of Louisa Durrell. The story follows an English family in the 1930s. Louisa, a young widow with four children, struggles with life as a single parent living in Bournemouth. The Durrell children are 21-year-old Larry, an estate agent with dreams of becoming a novelist; 18-year-old Leslie; 17-year-old Margo; and the youngest, 11-year-old Gerry, an animal enthusiast who constantly gets into trouble at school. Taking a drastic risk, Louisa decides to move the family to Corfu to try to improve their lives.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:42</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, History, Literature, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-01-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:20:00</td></tr></table>
