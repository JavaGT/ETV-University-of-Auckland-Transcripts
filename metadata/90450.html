On television and online The Stream taps into the extraordinary potential of social media to disseminate news. The Stream is an aggregator of online sources and discussion, seeking out unheard voices, new perspectives from people on the ground and untold angles related to the most compelling stories of the day.

This is not a show simply about the hottest viral videos or trending stories on the internet. Our goal is to connect with unique, less-covered online communities around the world and share their stories and viewpoints on the news of the day. A key part of The Stream&rsquo;s mission is to help its viewers discover the newest online tools and advice to develop and share their information through these fast-changing networks.

Social networking now offers new possibilities to expand Al Jazeera English&rsquo;s mission to give voice to the voiceless. As the tremendous growth of these networks moulds and transforms the news agenda, The Stream aims to share these possibilities and connect its global audience into a dynamic online dialogue.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Magazine, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, Education & Teaching, Information Technology, Media Studies, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
