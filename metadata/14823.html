In this programme Iain looks at how salt is central to Mediterranean history. Salt is a key part of the Atlantic conveyor which switches ice ages on and off. We examine salt as a means of preservation for the Egyptians in their unpredictable climate, and as preservation and therefore a means of trading for the Phoenicians.

And we see how salt was important to the rise and fall of the Venetians and why that story ultimately influenced the food Italy is famous for today.

Geologist Dr Iain Stewart presents a series showing how the rocks beneath our feet have shaped the human history of the Mediterranean. His whistle-stop tour takes in familiar tourist destinations in Egypt, Italy and Greece, but provides a unique geologist's insight which can't be found in the guidebooks.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Anthropology, Classical Studies, Economics, Food Science, Geography, History, Science, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:30:00</td></tr></table>
