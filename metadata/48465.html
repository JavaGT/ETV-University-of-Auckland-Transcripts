Every 15 seconds in Australia, an ambulance is called for help. Rushing to the scene are paramedics, who deal with emergencies from bleeding noses to heart attacks - they know what having a bad day really means.

From eight grueling weeks of training college, to the first shift on the front line, our cameras are with the paramedics every step of the way.
