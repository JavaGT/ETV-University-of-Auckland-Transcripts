Comedy panel show hosted by English comedian Jimmy Carr that uses statistics and a series of opinion polls as a basis for discussion. Celebrity guests from the worlds of comedy and entertainment are divided into two teams, and each team is posed with a number of topical and light-hearted questions that they then debate. The rounds of questions include simple `true or false' statements as well as some more open subjects, such as guessing the most popular issues discussed by the British public in a particular week.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Magazine, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-05-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:50:00</td></tr></table>
