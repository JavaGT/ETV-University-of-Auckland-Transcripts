&ldquo;Lost and Sold&rdquo; is a new treasure hunt, auction television series where shrewd and savvy dealers buy unclaimed, and lost-in-transit items at auction then reveal their surprising and jaw dropping value.

The series features a group of shrewd and savvy dealers who attend a weekly, misguided freight auction in pursuit of lost items to flip for profit.  These guys are the real deal and the money they make from a day&rsquo;s work will leave viewers astounded.
From everyday items to obscure and wacky one-offs &hellip;if it&rsquo;s been lost, you&rsquo;ll find it here and it&rsquo;s for sale.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Business, Economics</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-08-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
