But some fish species behave in ways that make them unsuitable for trawl surveys - especially those that form large or dense schools. Trawling in too many schools may lead to the population of the species being overestimated while trawling in areas where the species isn't congregating may lead to underestimation. &lt;br&gt; However with acoustics, sound is reflected off fish and can be used to count them. Unlike trawling, acoustics works best when the fish gather in large or dense schools. But how do you know you're counting orange roughy and not snapper? NIWA has been researching this question using computer models of how sound reflects from fish. This has involved 3D laser scanning of fish swimbladders to work out how their size and shape determine the echo from the fish. NIWA has  also been doing CT scans to get precise data on the density of all the parts of the fish and how these parts reflect sound. &lt;br&gt;  Featuring Gavin Macaulay Fisheries Acoustics for the National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research (NIWA)</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Natural History, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
