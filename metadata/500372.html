It has an operating temperature of 110 kelvin [about minus 170 degrees C]. Jeff and his team fought for 16 years to obtain a US patent for the material. It was finally issued to them in 2004. It is currently the only HTS material used in long-length wires and is now being used to manufacture very efficient and compact cables, transformers, magnets, generators and motors. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Jeff Tallon, Professor of Physics in the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington and Simon Gibson, a production engineer with Industrial Research Ltd.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
