On a training exercise, the soldiers demonstrate how they work with a large tank transporter. They locate a tank with a broken track and on fire. After dousing the flames, the soldiers load the tank onto the transporter. 02.25 RNZAF Selecting Aircrews: During 3 months at the Initial Training Wing, would-be airmen are subjected to a range of tests to see if they're up to the job. They are tested on how well they see in the dark and to gauge how quick their reactions are. The airmen enter a decompression chamber to simulate high altitude conditions and a Medical Officer explains the affects of rapid ascent. The men are taken up to 5000 feet and then taken down suddenly then up to 20,000 feet where they try to decode messages - this is not easy because thin air acts like an anesthetic. When the men put oxygen masks on they regain their normal efficiency. The men undergo a series of personal interviews - temperamental fitness is every bit as important as physical fitness. At the end of the three month course, results from all the testing are brought together - the scores decide whether the trainee is going to be a pilot, observer or gunner.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
