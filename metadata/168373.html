About series:
The Atlantic Ocean is vast, wild and unforgiving. Stretching from the Antartic in the south, to the Arctic in the north, the Americas in the west to Africa and Europe in the east, it covers 20% of the earth&rsquo;s surface. Its irresistible power shapes lands with its unstoppable force. To survive in and around the world&rsquo;s ocean takes tenacity and strength.

This is the story of birth and death, struggle and survival, where the Atlantic meets Europe, where the land meets the sea.


Four films, each documenting a different season in and around the Atlantic, through the lives of the animals that live there. Every season brings new challenges. All must be resilient and adaptable if they&rsquo;re to survive a year in the wild Atlantic.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Ecology & Environment, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC Earth</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-09-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:40:00</td></tr></table>
