About Inside Claridge's:

Claridge's is a very grand, very British hotel.  

Based in the heart of London's Mayfair, for 200 years it's been a favourite of celebrities and royalty and has become a byword for discreet luxury. 

Now, for the first time, documentary makers have been allowed behind the scenes to discover the traditions and challenges that lie behind its pampering, five star service. 

This three part series follows life at Claridge's over the course of a year, observing preparations for visiting foreign royalty, charting a major renovations programme and meeting regular guests from the ex-bookmaker who's breakfasted at the hotel every day for forty years to the pampered pet who's notched up over twenty stays.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>44s</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-05-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
