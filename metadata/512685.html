Education Minister Jan Tinetti said it meant beginning teachers will get nearly $10,000 a year more on top of a $7210 lump sum payment.

&quot;The offer provides an increase of 36 percent for teachers at the top of the pay scale since we've been in Government, compared to a 10 percent increase under the last National government,&quot; she said.

Tinetti said the government only had a certain amount of money to work with, and the main savings of $374m had been found from the Ministry of Education's departmental funding, a forecast underspend on staffing as a result of newer teachers employed, removal of the option to 'bank staffing' at schools, deferring Te Ao Marama and Hobsonville Point Secondary School projects in the Public Private Partnership Schools Expansion Programme, and rephasing the current operating funding.

&quot;There will be some projects within the ministry that they will have to cut back on, but that will come from their departmental funding,&quot; she said.

&quot;We've given this very very careful consideration. Since the arbitration panel's report came out we've been working through this so that any reprioritisation and changing around in the funding is going to have the least impact on young people's learning as we possibly can.

&quot;The options that we've landed on here will have the least impact.&quot;

She said additional allowance for tikanga expertise were included, as recommended by the panel, and in line with the primary teachers' agreement.
