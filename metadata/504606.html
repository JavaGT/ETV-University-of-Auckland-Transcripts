And, I know everybody, because they're here for years...and, it's a pleasure just to say hello to people...and they know that they like to see me. I think that they feel secure, just seeing me day after day. I don't impinge on them, or try to... I just walk around.  It's called &quot;management by walking around&quot;. So I walk around a lot. And, people, from time to time will tell me that they like to see me do that. &quot;
