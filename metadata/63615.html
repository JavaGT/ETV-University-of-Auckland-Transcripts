The show was once again exemplified Humberto Leon and Carol Lim's surfer style at its finest.  Models moved down from the stage to a circular runway at a fast pace.  The 'New Wave' vibe was felt throughout - literally - in images of waves printed on teese, in the blue and white tones and in the knitwear. Also worth noting - the black and white street art and line prints.
