But how do you know when you've actually solved a problem? What do you expect to happen that would equal success? In this episode, Sabrina chats about how engineers look at results to help them know when they've achieved success.

This first series is based on 5th-grade science. We're super excited and hope you enjoy Crash Course Kids!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Animation, Lecture</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Art, Design, Education & Teaching, Engineering, History, Teaching</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-06-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:35:00</td></tr></table>
