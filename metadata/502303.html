He was happy and didn&rsquo;t ask for much. But an appointment with his doctor changed the course of his life in the most dramatic way. It&rsquo;s been determined that this medical appointment left Josh not fully informed and without having received the appropriate standard of care. And the doctor has abruptly left New Zealand.
