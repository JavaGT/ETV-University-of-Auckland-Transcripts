It covers the basic science along with current and potential future technological solutions. With a range of views from farmers to scientists to economists, the film also looks at the challenge of mitigating agricultural GHGs. It covers how we can develop policy and actions to not only deal with NZ's emissions, but lead the world in showing other countries it can be done.
