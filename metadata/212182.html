The story follows a 12-year-old girl named Fei Fei (voiced by Cathy Ang), who has lost her beloved mother to a terminal illness, as she struggles to reconcile her continuing sorrow with the fact that her father (voiced by John Cho) is considering remarrying. Fei Fei is a science wiz who also happens to believe fervently in Chang&rsquo;e, the Chinese moon goddess whose thwarted love for the archer Houyi was one of her mom&rsquo;s favourite stories. Struggling with the fact that the world expects her to move on from both her anguish and her childhood belief in a magic moon queen, Fei Fei gets the bright idea of building a rocket to the Moon, to go meet Chang&rsquo;e and prove that she exists. (&ldquo;I would fly beyond the stars to keep my family/If I did, I&rsquo;d show my father love lasts all eternity,&rdquo; she sings.) The girl&rsquo;s homemade ship, cast in a massive paper lantern shell, catapulted by magnets, and powered by what appears to be a thousand firecrackers, shoots into the sky &mdash; then begins to fall back to Earth. Suddenly, a mysterious beam from the sky catches it, and the rocket is carried to the lunar surface by giant, glowing orbital Chinese imperial guardian lions.
