Stem cells are unspecialized cells with the unique property to self-renew or make copies of themselves and to differentiate into specialized cells. The goal of stem cell therapy is to enhance the body's natural process of regeneration. There are a considerable number of stem cells currently under investigation for patients with heart attacks, angina, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease. We have made considerable progress but have many questions left to answer.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:17:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Children, Documentary, Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Careers, Chemistry, Engineering, Health, Leadership, Learning Support, Physical Education, Science, Sociology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-07-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:01:00</td></tr></table>
