Lewis, and George MacDonald were the pioneers of the fantasy genre, and their impact is unmistakable. This documentary interviews scholars, writers, filmmakers, and lovers of the fantasy genre throughout the world. Combined with historical reenactments, the film travels from the halls of Oxford and Cambridge, where Tolkien and Lewis spent their careers as academics, the south of England where MacDonald lived, as well as through North America to meet some of the scholars who have dedicated their careers to the study of these fantasy giants.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:24:01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Advertising/Marketing, Art, Design, History, Literature, Media Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-03-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
