'The Chemical Education Material Study', better known as 'CHEM Study', was developed in the early 1960s at U.C. Berkeley's College of Chemistry, Lawrence Hall of Science, and Harvey Mudd College, and continued at the Lawrence Hall of Science through the 1980s. The textbook was written by Glenn T. Seaborg in the early 1960s. Catalysis is the increase in the rate of a chemical reaction due to the participation of an additional substance called a catalyst. With a catalyst, reactions occur faster and require less activation energy. Because catalysts are not consumed in the catalyzed reaction, they can continue to catalyze the reaction of further quantities of reactant.
