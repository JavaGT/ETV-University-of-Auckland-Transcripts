Te Ohu Mo Papatuanuku - the remediation of the Kopeopeo Canal. Toxicity caused by the forestry in Whakatane has had an enormous impact on the environment. Mātauranga Māori, Western Science and numerous agencies have joined forces to remediate the dioxin-contaminated Kopeopeo Canal in Whakatane.

From protecting our national icon, the Kiwi, to working on ground-breaking new treatments in the fight against cancer, Maori scientific innovation is at the forefront of the second series of ', on Maori Television. Presented by Victoria University lecturer Dr Ocean Mercier, the series is funded by Te Māngai Paho and sponsored by The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

'Project Mātauranga' highlights the growth of Māori worldviews within New Zealand's scientific community and celebrates the people and ideas that are giving our country an edge in the world of science. Formatted around the structure of an experiment, viewers see problems resolved through the application of Western science and Māori knowledge systems. As Dr Mercier explains - Our brand of science maybe a little different from Western science but nonetheless it allowed us to work in the world, to be in the world, to live in the world, to survive in the world for generations and thousands of years.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:35</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Chemistry, Ecology & Environment, Geography, Maori, Natural History, New Zealand, Philosophy, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata Māori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-09-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
