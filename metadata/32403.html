In the 1800s, the Terraces were labelled the %5C%22Eighth Wonder of the World%2C%5C%22 tourists came from around the globe to see them - two stacks of glimmering terraces made of silica, created by hot fluids packed with minerals derived from deep within the Earth. Then in June 1886, the Terraces were considered lost when Mt Tarawera erupted, devastating much of the surrounding landscape, and killing 120 people. Tonight this captivating local documentary examines the full story of the scientific expedition to re-discover the Terraces, lying at the bottom of Lake Rotomahana.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-06-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:29:00</td></tr></table>
