It&rsquo;s a world of huge, far-reaching ideas - a bullet-proof test against drug cheats, renewable energy delivered from a vortex, and milk powder made from precision fermentation. But these ideas are all homegrown, and currently being made or tested right here in Aotearoa. Start-ups require big money, and big risks, but it&rsquo;s this kind of innovative thinking and disruptive technology that could propel our economy into the future.
 
MAKING WAVES
Logan Murray has been one of New Zealand&rsquo;s most renowned surf photographers since the 1970s but very few people would know what he looks like and there&rsquo;s a good reason for that - he&rsquo;s been a marked man for over 50 years. His images of perfect, empty waves put Aotearoa on the world surf map and have been voted some of the greatest surf photos ever. They also earned him death threats from New Zealand&rsquo;s underground surf culture, worried his photos would attract hordes of overseas surfers to their most secret spots. Murray keeps a low profile and wears a disguise when he goes to the beach but, he&rsquo;s finally coming clean on the real story behind his most famous photo.

WONKY WORLD
Willy Wonka has entranced kids and adults alike for decades. So when Scottish entrepreneur Billy Coull decided to launch a Willy Wonka show, he thought he&rsquo;d be securing the winning ticket &ndash; making kids happy while making plenty of money for himself. His plan to take an empty warehouse and let Roald Dahl&rsquo;s world of wonder unfold inside, was going to deliver huge audiences. Instead, the show was disaster of monumental proportions. A key fact was to rely on artificial intelligence to plan and then sell the show, but AI wasn&rsquo;t smart enough to understand the special nature of Wonka magic. Coull&rsquo;s idea of fun quickly turned to farce, and soon, much of the world was laughing for the wrong reasons.
