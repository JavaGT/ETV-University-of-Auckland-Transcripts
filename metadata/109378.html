Upper Middle Bogan follows the story of two very different families connected by blood. Bess Denyar is a doctor who lives in a nice house in an inner city suburb of Melbourne with her architect husband, Danny and 13-year-old twins Oscar and Edwina. Bess is stunned when she finds out that she is adopted through blood test results, when her overbearing posh mother Margaret is admitted to the hospital for low blood sugar levels. Bess embarks on a journey to meet her birth parents Wayne and Julie Wheeler.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:34:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies, New Zealand, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-07-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:00:00</td></tr></table>
