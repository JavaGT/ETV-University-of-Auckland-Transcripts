It could have all gone so well &ndash; an ambitious former tech geek becoming, at age 23, the youngest mayor in New Zealand&rsquo;s history. Instead, Ben Bell&rsquo;s mayoralty in the Southland town of Gore has been steeped in controversy, rumours and dysfunction. The Council&rsquo;s chief executive and Bell are no longer on speaking terms, and an independent review is underway. Key players are split into two camps &ndash; including the mayor&rsquo;s mother and a councillor called &lsquo;Caveman&rsquo; &ndash; but what of the local community? And is this drama just the tip of the iceberg? Reporter: Kristin Hall Producer: Nadene Ghouri Cameras: Tory Evans, Jared McCulloch Editor: Gareth Pearce

GAME OF THRONES
It&rsquo;s not often a 74-year-old takes on a new job, let alone one they&rsquo;ll keep for the rest of their life, but such is the lot of King Charles III. This new monarch now begins the near impossible task of filling his mother&rsquo;s shoes. Polling has shown that not only was Queen Elizabeth II immensely more popular than Charles, so too are his son, Prince William, his sister Anne, Princess Royal, and even his grandchildren. But this week, close confidantes of His Majesty and Queen Camilla explain why the monarchy is in the best hands.
