episode notes from www.animal.discovery.com

making waves is the behind-the-scenes show of the blue planet series, concentrating on how the filmmakers worked together with scientific advisers from practically every field of marine science. 

in nearly 200 locations around the world, we follow the crews as they tackle some of the most difficult filming any have ever dared to undertake. 

following the themes of the series, making waves journeys through eight different ocean habitats, from the frozen seas of the polar regions to the deepest depths and the widest stretches of open ocean.
