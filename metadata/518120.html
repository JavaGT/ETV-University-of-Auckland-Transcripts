Every episode, I will be talking with or about an aspect of Japanese culture within NZ and sharing with you some of the ways you can get involved or visit these places for yourself!

This episode I visit the Wairarapa Archives and talk to Mark Pacey about Featherston Prisoner of War Camp where Japanese Prisoners were held during WWII. Mark is an expert on New Zealand's War history, and he gives us a rundown of how so many Japanese soldiers became imprisoned in a camp just North of Wellington during the War.
