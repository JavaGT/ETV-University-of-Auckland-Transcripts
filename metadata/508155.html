De-influencing is the latest backlash to what critics say is the normalisation of overconsumption on TikTok, where social media influencers are paid by companies to promote viral products in &ldquo;haul&rdquo; videos.

Now &ldquo;de-influencers&rdquo; are using the platform to encourage people to question their buying habits, and think more critically about the impact that companies &ndash; particularly those in the fast fashion and beauty industries &ndash; are having on the environment and labour practices.

A popular platform for content creators to share ever-changing microtrends in fashion, skincare and beauty, TikTok is seen by some as a go-to resource for keeping up with new aesthetics and what to buy to achieve the look. But, fueled in part by a cost of living crisis and people craving authenticity online, de-influencing is also leading to scepticism of the influencer industry and conversations about how TikTok-specific trends are encouraging unchecked consumerism.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-02-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
