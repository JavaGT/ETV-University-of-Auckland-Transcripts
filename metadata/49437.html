Griff is in the French capital, object of great chauvinistic pride and vanity. Although resulting in a mind-boggling traffic mayhem, its street grid largely results from some ambitious planning. It's extremely rich in monuments, yet the Eiffeltower, hated by many celebrities, draws by far most visitors and a clandestine group does much-needed restoration rather then the city services, which concentrate on mundane daily concerns. The rich capital is obsessed with cuisine and fashion.

British comedian Griff Rhys Jones visits six metropolises to find out what makes them arguably the greatest cities in the world. The selection includes London, Rome and Paris in the Old World plus New York, Sydney and Hong Kong in the New World. He looks into to oddities, traditions, even tries out some remarkable city - and private jobs for a day.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Geography, History, Sociology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-12-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
