(Part Three cont: Champollion. These episodes show how Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion used the Rosetta Stone to unlock the mysteries of the lost civilisation of Ancient Egypt which had been closed off to Europeans for centuries prior to the invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. The stone, discovered by the French in 1799, had been created as a work of propaganda by the Greek speaking Pharaoh Ptolemy V to establish his place in Egyptian cosmology and flashbacks are included to explain this belief system).

Champollion was determined to travel to Egypt to prove his theory but poor and jobless he was reduced to buying up whatever scraps of papyrus he could find and this obsession alienated his wife. (The Dendera zodiac purchased by the French King Charles X threatened to challenge the biblical chronologies of church scholars, as it was believed by some to date to before the Great Flood of 2349 BC. Champollion was called in to confirm Sacy's dating of the antiquity to around 2000 BC; he disputed Sacy's dating but not Church authorities by dating it to some 2,000 years later than that during the Roman period).

Champollion was sent to Turin by the King to value a collection put up for sale by the French Consul to Egypt Bernardino Drovetti. Prior to his departure Champollion's wife announced that she was pregnant and she was not pleased by his new job. Champollion  built a strong reputation for himself in Italy even before being invited for an audience with Pope Leo XII. After returning to Paris with a large collection of antiquities for the King he wass put in charge of the Egyptian collection at the Louvre. The King finally agreed to fund Champollion's expedition to Egypt on the proviso that he would not publish any finds that would contradict the teachings of the Church. Champollion, arriving in 1828, started by studying the Great Pyramid at Giza, discovering it to be a tomb built for the Pharaoh Khufu around 2560 BC. At Saqqara he found the site largely stripped by dealers but in a forgotten tomb he discovered ancient hieroglyphs he translated to prove his theories. Eager to understand the Ancient Egyptians he pushed on to the ancient capital of Thebes where at the sprawling Temple of Karnak he read the story of Ramesses the Great and the battle against the Hittites at Kadesh.

At Belzoni's Tomb in the Valley of the Kings the ailing Champollion read the story of Pharaoh Seti I and learned of the burial rites of Pharaohs. He was thus able to comprehend the belief system of the Ancient Epyptians for the first time. Champillion died in France 18 months later but his legacy allowed Egyptologist to comprehend the meaning behind monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza and to decipher papyri that lead to such discoveries as the Tomb of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter.

Dramatisation of the great discoveries of ancient Egypt, from the exploration of tombs in the early 1800s, to the unraveling of the Rosetta Stone to translate the ancient language on the tombs, to the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Architecture, Geography, History, Political Studies, Religion & Theology, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-08-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:30:00</td></tr></table>
