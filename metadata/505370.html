The Sunday team travels across three bible belt states speaking exclusively to doctors, gynaecologists, obstetricians, nurses and women affected by America&rsquo;s extreme abortion bans.

AMERICA TO AOTEAROA
Is the pain of America&rsquo;s abortion debate, New Zealand&rsquo;s gain? The fallout from America&rsquo;s extreme abortion bans has seriously unsettled many of its doctors and nurses to the point of leaving. Abortions have become illegal in 18 mainly southern states, since the US Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe vs Wade decision in June. The Sunday team drove 1000s of kilometres across three bible belt states speaking exclusively to doctors, gyneacologists obstetricians, nurses and women affected by the ban. Many of these medical specialists now say America no longer feels safe and want to move to New Zealand.
