Phil visits Sydney to help Alastair Hewson and David Luxton buy a city-centre pad.
Sydney is Australia's most iconic and famous city, which, with its popular mix of relaxed beach lifestyle and busy cosmopolitan culture, is also one of the most expensive places to buy property in the world.
Work colleagues Alastair Hewson and David Luxton are clubbing together to buy a place. Since being sponsored by their company to relocate six months ago, Alastair and David have been forking out nearly &pound;2000 a month on rent, so they are in a rush to buy.

Meanwhile, in his quest to discover Brits who have successfully made the move to Oz, Phil meets Nikola Ellis, a former London career girl whose move to Australia changed her life.
And Phil's investigation into the Skilled Occupation List leads him to a flying instructor from Hampshire whose career has taken off since moving down under.

Have you ever dreamed of starting a new life down under? Phil Spencer helps British families relocate to Australia. Over four shows, Phil gives the definitive guide to all things Oz. With a wife from Melbourne and an extensive knowledge of the Aussie property market, Phil uses all his experience to find four emigrating British families their perfect pads down under.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Geography, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
