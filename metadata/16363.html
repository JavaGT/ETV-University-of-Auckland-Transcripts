Some have never left the land they call home. Called Nga Pakaiahi (keepers of fire), these are the people who carry the history of the area; the unique stories, anecdotes, songs and lifestyle. Te Haukainga is a look at places that time has almost forgotten; an insight into lifestyles all but extinct. Producer Puhi Rangiaho says the series is a salute to those who have eschewed the city lifestyle and stayed on their land. &quot;It was a privilege to be able to visit with these very private people and get a glimpse of their lives and their kaupapa.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-08-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:00:00</td></tr></table>
