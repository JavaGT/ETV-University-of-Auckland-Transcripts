The man in question tells Father James that he was repeatedly raped by a priest as a boy and that as a result, he intends to kill an innocent priest, theorising that that will make more of a splash; he therefore gives Father James a week to get his house in order, telling him that he will meet him on the beach, a week on Sunday.
