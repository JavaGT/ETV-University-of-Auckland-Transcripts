The guys prepare for Star Wars Day and plan to watch all six films. Leonard tells Sheldon that Arthur Jeffries (Professor Proton), their childhood hero, has passed away. While Sheldon is sleeping through the film marathon, Jeffries appears to Sheldon dressed as a Jedi Master. He does not know why he is there or what advice to give Sheldon, so he tells him to cherish the people around him before they die. Penny and Leonard attend Jeffries' funeral, where they start to discuss their regrets in life and Leonard regrets not saying yes to Penny's marriage proposal. After Leonard returns home, Sheldon wakes up and hugs him, taking Arthur's advice. Bernadette and Amy make a Death Star cake for the guys while talking about why they became scientists. Finally, Sheldon has another dream where Arthur asks him if watching Star Wars is a useful way to spend his life and Sheldon sees nothing wrong with it.

'The Big Bang Theory' is an American sitcom. The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-07-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
