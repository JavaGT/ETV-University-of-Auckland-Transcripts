The basic physics defining this water motion also acts on somewhat smaller scales, causing eddies along coastlines and near harbours. &lt;br&gt;The same physics is controlling behaviour at still smaller scales like ocean waves. Finally, water motion plays a part in controlling microscopic life at the millimetre scale. NIWA uses sophisticated methods to study how ocean waters move and mix. The tools they use include vessels (from ocean-going ships to single-engine zodiacs), sampling devices that stay at sea for years at a time, drifting robots sending information to satellites, and powerful computer programs. &lt;br&gt;
