About series:
When everyone is out for revenge, no one is safe.

Bobby Axelrod and Chuck Rhoades, former enemies, and Wendy Rhoades, the chief counsellor to each, have come together to form an uneasy but highly effective alliance, aimed at the eradication of all their rivals, including Grigor Andolov, Taylor Mason, Bryan Connerty and Waylon &quot;Jock&quot; Jeffcoat. Ambition and betrayal have long been at the heart of Billions, and this season all the characters find out exactly how high a price they'll have to pay to satisfy those needs.
