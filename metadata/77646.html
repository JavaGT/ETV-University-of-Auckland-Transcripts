DI Lewis and DS Hathaway investigate the murder of Dean Greely. As the investigation continues, they discover that Greely and three other men had formed a club during their Oxford student days, the Sons of the Twice Born. Today, the men have little contact with one another and initially deny that their club existed. When a second member of the foursome is murdered, it becomes apparent that they have a secret, from 30 years ago, and that someone is out for revenge.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:31:50</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, English</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
