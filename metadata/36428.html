The ruptured Maui Pipeline is not expected to be repaired until the weekend with millions of litres of milk being dumped and countless businesses affected by the gas leak crisis. Crews are working furiously to fix a crack discovered on a section of the pipeline running through a farm near White Cliffs about 20km north of New Plymouth.
