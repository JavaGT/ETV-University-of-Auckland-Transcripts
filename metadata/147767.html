It was an experience that would profoundly shape his career and legacy, as well as the world's understanding of the humanitarian cost of war. Griffiths captured incredible images of the victims of war and his 1971 photo journal, Vietnam Inc, transformed forever our understanding of this terrible conflict. This beautifully shot documentary gives fascinating insight into the life and legacy of a man who was a true humanitarian and whose pictures are classics of photojournalism, as powerful today as the day they were taken.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History, Photography</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-11-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
