Unfortunately the ringer falls to bits while he is demonstrating it to camera. 02.35 Guadalcanal Army Mules: The Pacific War isn't all men and machines - the army mule is a very useful beast on jungle and mountain trials that vehicles can't use. These horses and mules are treated by vets for everyday injuries and those received in action. 03.55 Mediterranean Front, Reinforcements and Wounded: New Zealand troops arrive in Egypt on their way to reinforce the division in Italy. &quot;They've got a very good chance of being in for the kill in the Western Theatre of war and the heart of Germany is their final destination.&quot; The men embark on troop ships that take them across the Mediterranean Sea.
