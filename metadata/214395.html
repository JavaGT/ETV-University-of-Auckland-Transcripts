In June 2011, Paul Simon thrilled hometown fans with a special club performance at New York City&rsquo;s historic Webster Hall. The show was the culmination of a sold-out, triumphant, two-month U.S. tour. The resulting concert captures this extraordinary event and is part of special programming premiering on PBS stations beginning December 3, 2011 (check local listings).

The setlist was drawn from his legendary career and includes several songs that haven&rsquo;t been performed live in many years. &ldquo;Kodachrome,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother and Child Reunion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gone At Last&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Obvious Child&rdquo; are just some of the highlights as well as songs from Simon&rsquo;s recently released, brilliant new album So Beautiful or So What (Hear Music/Concord Music Group) including &ldquo;Dazzling Blue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rewrite,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Afterlife&rdquo; and the album&rsquo;s propulsive title track.

Joining Paul on the show is a stellar band of musicians including Cameroonian guitarist Vincent Nguini, guitarist/drummer Jim Oblon, pianist Mick Rossi, saxophonist/ keyboardist Andrew Snitzer, bassist Bakithi Kumalo, guitarist Mark Stewart, master percussionist Jamey Haddad and multi-instrumentalist Tony Cedras.

Paul Simon, the first recipient of the Library of Congress&rsquo;s &ldquo;George Gershwin Award For Popular Song&rdquo; in 2007, is one of the most treasured musical performers in American history. This is an incredible musical event from an iconic artist who continues to work at the peak of his artistic and creative powers.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:31:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Entertainment, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Drama, History, Literature, Media Studies, Music, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-09-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
