About series:
Writer/director/producer Terence Nance is the mastermind behind this project, a &quot;show about the beauty and ugliness of contemporary American life,&quot; he says. Using a fluid, stream-of-conscience approach, Nance explores cultural idioms such as patriarchy, white supremacy and sensuality via numerous interconnected vignettes, all of which showcase an ensemble cast -- including Nance -- of emerging and established talent. Nance and his collaborators weave together such themes as ancestral trauma, history, death, romance and more, creating a television show like nothing seen before.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-10-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
