The final instalment of SAS: The Originals flashes forward to Europe, 1943. By this stage in the war, the Originals &ndash; the SAS men who were there from day one &ndash; had been operating successfully in the Western Desert for over a year. But the war in Africa was now over and their leader, David Stirling, had been captured by the Germans and transported to Berlin. With the SAS now under closer control from the British military hierarchy, its fate stood in the balance.

Presenter Colonel Tim Collins, who served with the SAS for 12 years, explores the last battles of World War II and the decisive role the SAS played in them. Through using private archival footage, Collins reveals the courage of the originals and the cunning of David Stirling. This episode is action-packed and gripping, with the latest graphic technology reconstructing some of the most epic moments of the war. We even travel to Nazi concentration camp Bergen Belsen, which the originals were the first to enter.

We end our journey with the war&rsquo;s close and the subsequent liquidation of the SAS. What happened to the originals and David Stirling? And why, after all this, were the SAS later revived?

The British Special Air Service regiment, the SAS, is one of the world&rsquo;s most elite and secretive military organisations. It operates in the clandestine world of Iraq, Afghanistan &ndash; and who knows where else. It guards its secrets, and even its history, carefully. Its origins, like its operations, are cloaked in mystery and myth. Those who know the regiment think there&rsquo;s only one part of the story of the SAS that should ever be told. It&rsquo;s the story of how and where the SAS began. It&rsquo;s the story of one man: David Stirling. And the band of misfits and rule-breakers who were with him on Day One: The Originals. Effectively, it&rsquo;s the story of the birth of modern Special Forces. 'SAS: The Originals' is that story.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Geography, History, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:30:00</td></tr></table>
