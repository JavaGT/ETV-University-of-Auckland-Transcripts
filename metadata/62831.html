on order out of chaos episode :

professor brian cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system.

brian reveals how beauty and order in earth's cosmic backyard was formed from nothing more than a chaotic cloud of gas. 
chasing tornados in oklahoma, he explains how the same physics that creates these spinning storms shaped the young solar system. 

out of this celestial maelstrom emerged the jewel in the crown, brian's second wonder - the magnificent rings of saturn.

on an ice-choked lagoon in iceland, he sees the nearest thing on earth to saturn's rings. 
using the latest scientific imagery and breathtaking graphics, he explains how the intricate patterns round saturn are shaped by the cluster of more than 60 moons surrounding the planet.
one of those moons makes a spectacular contribution to the rings and is the third wonder of the solar system. 

brian describes the astonishing discovery of giant fountains of ice erupting from the surface of enceladus, which soar thousands of kilometres into space.

notes from www.tvnz7.co.nz on this series:

for millennia mankind has been fascinated by the stars. travel deep into space with this five-part series, and see the many wonders beyond our planet with your own eyes. prepare to immerse yourself in an alien world as if you were standing there yourself. 

giant ice fountains rising over 100km high, an ocean hidden beneath a frozen crust of ice, storms three times the size of earth coloured blood red by a vortex of dust and gases, and immense volcanoes that would put mount everest in the shade - this series reveals the true and awesome beauty of our solar system. 

alongside these startlingly authentic images, some of the most spectacular, extreme locations on earth help to reveal wonders never thought possible. 

over five episodes, the series explores how these previously unseen phenomena have dramatically expanded our horizons, revealing more about the planets, their moons and how they came to be the way they are. 

the series also looks at the big picture - how the forces of nature carved out beauty and order from the chaos of space, how our home planet doesn't sit in magnificent isolation but is intimately connected with the rest of the solar system, and how these connections have created the haven we call earth.
