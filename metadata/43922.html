Now, his spirit glides through Tokyo watching his sister, Linda (Paz de la Huerta), and the rest of his bottom-dwelling expat crew as they deal with the aftermath of his death.

Tokyo's nasty underside, seen primarily through the eyes of Oscar, a heavy drug user, whose sister Linda is a stripper. Oscar also has flashbacks to his childhood when trauma upends the siblings. Oscar's drug-fed hallucinations alter Tokyo's already-disconcerting nights, and after the police shoot him, he can float above and look down: on his sister's sorrow, on the rooms of a love hotel, and on life at even a molecular level. The spectrum's colors can be beautiful; it's people's colorless lives that can be ugly. And what of afterlife, is there more than a void?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:01:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-06-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:25:00</td></tr></table>
