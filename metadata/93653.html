We also meet some of Liberty's most interesting customers, including a wealthy VIP who sees Liberty as his local corner shop.

Housed in an iconic half-timber building made from old battleships, 'Liberty' has been drawing in shoppers for over 130 years with its eccentric and eclectic designs. With unprecedented access to the store, its staff and its customers, this series tells the everyday stories of life within one of London's oldest department stores, following the race to get the Christmas shop open on time, via fashion weeks in London and Paris, VIP customer and celebrity visits, and the daily rituals at the heart of the store.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Careers, Design, Economics, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-11-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
