Southeast Asia has more active volcanoes than any other region on the planet. Many of its islands were born by this most destructive of forces. Volcanoes rule all life on Southeast Asia&rsquo;s islands of fire. For millions of years land has been built up, torn apart and destroyed. And that process is still taking place today.

For wildlife here, the only ever certainty has been change. But once the dust of these destructive forces settles, opportunities appear for those willing to take them. Volcano birds are an extreme adaptation to life on the islands of fire. Their nesting grounds and the surrounding forest are covered in new ash on a daily basis. Toba on Sumatra erupted 75,000 years ago. The explosion is thought to have plunged the earth into a volcanic winter that lasted for a thousand years. Some scientists believe it almost wiped out the human race. Toba has had a remarkable effect on Sumatra&rsquo;s wildlife. Even today, the island remains divided, with different species found to the north and south of the lake. The south is the realm of Malayan tapirs and banded leaf monkeys, while white-handed gibbons and Thomas&rsquo;s leaf monkeys live only to the north.

For those able to cross the sea, new volcanic islands are a world of opportunity. Plants are among the first to get there. The large seeds of Barringtonia can survive in seawater for up to two years. Some animals can swim across the gap to new islands. Water monitors are very capable swimmers and common across many of Southeast Asia&rsquo;s islands.

New Guinea is part of Australia&rsquo;s continental shelf. It was once connected by lower sea levels; allowing Australia to bestow its continental crown with some of its most iconic wildlife. Normally, kangaroos are not renowned for their tree climbing abilities. Tree-kangaroos may look alarming out of place but since no monkeys or squirrels live here, they&rsquo;ve taken up the opportunity to feed on the abundant leaves.



About series:
Southeast Asia is the most diverse region on our planet. Nature&rsquo;s most powerful forces have combined to create islands of fire, a water world driven by the sway of the moon and rich forests fuelled by the tropical sun. An extraordinary array of plants and animals live here; many of which are found nowhere else on earth.

The islands of Southeast Asia are some of the most spectacular and diverse places on earth. They are home to the majestic, the beautiful and the downright bizarre. In the tropical forests that drape their rugged slopes, there are kangaroos that climb trees; pigs whose teeth grow through their heads. The biggest of cats rules, where rhinos have hair and birds hatch out of the sand.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Ecology & Environment, Geography, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-01-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:00:00</td></tr></table>
