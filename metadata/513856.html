I thought &lsquo;gee, I&rsquo;m heading to the tip, I really should pick up the rubbish on my way!&rsquo;  But no, with too little time, nor space in the trailer, I just went about my predictable business and the rubbish stayed where it lay. This day of newness is about making good of that idea and going to the tip with an empty trailer, filling it on the way! Simple as that. This is day 7 of 12 days of newness.
