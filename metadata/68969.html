In 1943, a 24-year-old maths student and a GPO engineer combined to hack into Hitler's personal super-code machine - not Enigma but an even tougher system, which he called his 'secrets writer'. Their break turned the Battle of Kursk, powered the D-day landings and orchestrated the end of the conflict in Europe. But it was also to be used during the Cold War - which meant both men's achievements were hushed up and never officially recognised.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:06:12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Engineering, History, Mathematics, Political Studies, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-11-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
