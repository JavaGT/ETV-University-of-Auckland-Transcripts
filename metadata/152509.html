About series:
Based on the book series by Joe R. Lansdale, Hap &amp; Leonard follows two lifelong best friends &ndash; Hap Collins and Leonard Pine &ndash; as they find themselves in heaps of trouble, caught in the middle of a murder mystery with more twists and turns than an East Texan highway.

Set just before Christmas of 1989, Hap and Leonard scramble to locate Florida Grange, who has gone missing in the Klan-infested town of Grovetown. Once again at the centre of an impending storm of Biblical proportion, Hap and Leonard find themselves at odds with a cast of characters so tough they could chew the bumper off a pickup truck, including a possibly corrupt sheriff, and the leader of the Caucasian Knights. The boys learn that the good guys don&rsquo;t always win, and nobody beats Mother Nature.
