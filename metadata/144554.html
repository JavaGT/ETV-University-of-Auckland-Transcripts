Mountain animals are amongst the most elusive in the world, and this film provides unique and intimate glimpses into their secretive lives.

Witness the moment four snow leopards come together when a mother and cub become trapped between two rival males. Join grizzly bears as they dance against trees to rub off their winter fur and soar with golden eagles hunting amongst Europe's snow-capped peaks.

About the Series:
Sir David Attenborough returns in this breathtaking documentary showcasing life on Planet Earth.

&quot;Planet Earth&quot; was the first natural history documentary to be filmed in high definition, and now a decade later improved technology has made it possible to capture further details, from elusive animal behaviors to previously inaccessible remote landscapes. In addition to exploring the wilderness, the series examines urban dwellings, focusing on animals that have adapted to city life.

Experience the world from the viewpoint of animals themselves. From spellbinding wildlife spectacle to intimate encounters, Planet Earth II takes you closer than ever before.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Media Studies, Natural History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
