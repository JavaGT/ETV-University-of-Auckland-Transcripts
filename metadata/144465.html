He ends this first leg on Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island that is practically America's 51st state.

From flying boats to drug busts, Simon explores both the light and dark sides of the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean's most popular tourist destination. He joins the police anti-narcotics division on the front line in the war against international drug cartels in Santo Domingo before crossing the border to Haiti, where he visits the notorious tented camps of Cite Soleil. These slums remain home to many of the survivors of the worst earthquake to hit the island in two centuries. From voodoo ceremonies to dolphin watching, Simon also discovers a vibrant, colourful and thriving side to life in Haiti borne out of the country's unique history.

Finally, Simon reaches Puerto Rico, an island with close ties to the USA. He visits the tiny, paradisiacal island of Vieques, billed as the Caribbean's next major tourist destination. However, not everything here is as it seems, as Simon examines the impact six decades of bombing and weapons testing by the US Navy and Army has had on the landscape of this tiny island and on the people who live there.

Simon Reeve travels around the edge of the Caribbean Sea for a stunning new three-part series. With thousands of beautiful islands and a long mainland coast, the Caribbean is a vast area spanning a million square miles. Home to some of the most dangerous places on the planet, it is also one of the most vibrant, exciting and extreme regions on earth.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>06:55:00</td></tr></table>
