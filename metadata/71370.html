Shortly afterwards, they're attacked by a mysterious furry black creature, which they promptly beat to death and take to the 19th floor flat of local drug dealer Ron (Nick Frost) for identification purposes. However, things quickly go from bad to worse as the gang realise that their dead creature is just the beginning of a full-scale alien invasion. Soon, dozens of furry black creatures with glow-in-the-dark teeth are converging on their tower block and the gang will have to join forces with Sam, posh stoner Brewis (Luke Treadaway) and local gangster Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter) in order to fight them off.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:24:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-12-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
