In this film, for the first time, we peel back the layers around one of South Africa&rsquo;s most colourful artists as he looks back at a career spanning 30 years.

Famed for his painting, his sculptures and his performances, as well as his high level collaborations with artists like David Bowie, Arno Carstens and Brian Eno &ndash; wherever Bailey goes, he certainly leaves his mark. This film is a constant dialogue, a conversation with colleagues, collaborators, critics, and of course the artist himself.

Outspoken and political, Bailey has been called a jester, a joker, a provocateur and an Outsider. He would argue that it is from the outside that one keeps a fresh perspective, and that only from this position can one be a real force for change.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Design, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-07-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
