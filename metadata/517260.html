When you first see them, they almost feel obvious in hindsight, mainly due to how simple and elegant the algorithm ends up being. But there's an underlying story of how they were discovered by Huffman and how he built the idea from early ideas in information theory that is often missed. This video is all about how information theory inspired the first algorithms in data compression, which later provided the groundwork for Huffman's landmark discovery.
