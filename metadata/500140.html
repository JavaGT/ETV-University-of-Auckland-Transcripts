A triumph of engineering involving the removal of a hill into the sea, the airport cuts a bay-to-bay swathe across the capital's residential area. The film shows that as far back as 1913 New Zealanders were building and flying aircraft and that the old Rongotai airfield became inadequate for the growing traffic. It concludes with the spectacular air pageant that marked the official opening.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:13:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
