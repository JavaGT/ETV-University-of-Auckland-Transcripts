Every episode, I will be talking with or about an aspect of Japanese culture within NZ and sharing with you some of the ways you can get involved or visit these places for yourself!  

This episode I visit the Featherston Heritage Museum and talk about Featherston Prisoner of War Camp, where Japanese Prisoners were held during WWII. I give a brief description of what you can expect to see at the Museum, and a history behind the memorials in the area.
