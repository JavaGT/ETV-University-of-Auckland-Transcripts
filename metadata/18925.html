In 586 B.C., the Babylonians lead almost all that remains of the tribe of Judah - the  Israelites - to exile in Babylon.  Only a few generations earlier, the northern tribes of the Israelites were taken into exile and vanished forever.  Now the Judeans, too, seem destined to disappear.  They fight back, however, by writing a book.  Using Judean stories from the past to explain present disastrous situations, the book becomes the earliest edition of the most influential work in history: the Bible.  This episode introduces the early and profoundly influential figures of Judaism: Abraham, who is the first to recognize the concept of one God; Moses, who receives the Ten Commandments from God; and David, whose sins teach the Israelites that no one is above the law of God.

'Kingdom of David: The Saga of the Israelites' is dedicated to the thesis that the Israelites and the Jewish faith changed human history &quot;as much as any empire that ever existed.&quot; Persecuted and slaughtered for practicing monotheism at a time when the prevailing belief was in multiple gods, the Kingdom of David kept itself united and solvent by passing along the history and traditions of its elders in written form (the &quot;religion of the book&quot;). Among the subjects explored are the formation of the laws of the Jews, the origins of their customs, and their strongly held and strictly enforced moral values. The playlist bellow includes individual episodes, each around 55 minutes long: By the Rivers of Babylon, The Book and the Sword, The End of Days, and The Gifts of the Jews. As often as possible, Kingdom of David was filmed on the exact locations where the historical events described herein occurred.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, History, Political Studies, Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-12-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
