Andy's world explodes as a result of a seemingly senseless act of violence during a concert shooting. When she sets out to unravel the details, she comes into direct conflict with Luke's former partner, Detective Jo Rosati, a new detective with 15 Division. As Rosati investigates the case, sparks begin to fly between her and Luke. Dov and Chris take charge to find out who the shooter is and Swarek debates whether or not to rejoin Guns &amp; Gangs.

They must learn not only to deal with their duties as police officers, but also deal with the problems and expectation of their families and friends.
