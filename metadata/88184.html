Starring: Ian McKellen and James Caviezel. 

Stylish modern reworking of the classic 1960&rsquo;s TV series, The Prisoner. Michael (Jim Caviezel &ndash; The Passion Of The Christ) has resigned from his job at surveillance firm Summakor, and now people are after him. On the day of his resignation, one minute he is in his New York apartment, the next he wakes in another place &ndash; a place known only as The Village. Here, there are no names, only numbers, the sky is blue and there is seeming peace and order, all overseen by the looming figure of Two (Ian McKellen &ndash; The Lord Of The Rings; X-Men). And for Two and everyone else in the Village, Michael is not Michael he is known as nothing but &ldquo;Six&rdquo;. Michael soon discovers this order is only surface thin, all is in the control of Two and more crucially, there is seemingly no escape. No matter how hard he tries. As Michael reluctantly attempts to acclimatise himself to life in the Village interacting with the people who live there, he is constantly taunted by memories of his &ldquo;real&rdquo; life in New York, memories that are pushing him to decipher the riddle that will lead to escape back to his life outside and the destruction of the power of Two. Caviezel and McKellen lead a stellar cast in this unique thriller about one man&rsquo;s battle for freedom.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Political Studies, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-08-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
