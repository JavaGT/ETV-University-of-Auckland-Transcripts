Overlooked and underrated, Collier (1885-1964) is a New Zealand painter whose time has come to step out of the shadows. 

Born in Wanganui, Collier travelled to England in her late twenties, and under the stimulus of Modernism began to find expression for her talent. Unlike fellow student Frances Hodgkins, however, she returned after almost 10 years, called home by family obligations that were to take precedence over art for the rest of her life. She didn't stop painting, but it was a career hobbled by social expectations and what seem to us now to be quaintly narrow attitudes towards art.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:30:00</td></tr></table>
