The conflict is taking a heavy toll on civilians with millions forced from their homes and on the verge of famine.
Sudan is facing a humanitarian crisis as its civil war drags on. The United Nations says 25 million people &ndash; half the population &ndash; need urgent assistance.

And can anything be done to ease the suffering of Sudan&rsquo;s people?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-04-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>23:30:00</td></tr></table>
