W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire with an interest in both a new residence and the wife (Greta Schr&ouml;der) of his estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim). The film is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Various names and other details were changed from the novel, including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok to avoid copyright issues.

Even with several details altered, Stoker's heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed. However, a few prints of Nosferatu survived, and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema.

The film was released in the United States on 3 June 1929, seven years after its original premiere in Germany.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:28:11</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-09-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:52:51</td></tr></table>
