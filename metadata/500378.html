The most striking example is Bose-Einstein condensation - an exotic state of matter in which the quantum wave properties of atoms are dominant. The realm of ultra cold gases, which has been achieved only in the past decade, is one of the highest profile areas of contemporary Physics, being recognised by Nobel prizes in 1997 (laser cooling) and 2001 (Bose-Einstein condensation). Ultra cold gases may provide the basis for vastly more powerful computers, called quantum computers. This video features the work of Professor Rob Ballagh and Dr Andrew Wilson at the University of Otago.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:04:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-08-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:43:32</td></tr></table>
