But for some, the journey to birth is the most dangerous they'll ever endure. Follow four extraordinary pregnancies that faced seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

Using ground-breaking photography, state-of-the-art special effects and amazing 4D scans National Geographic's In The Womb takes us on a series of remarkable journeys into the extraordinary world of fetal development. We witness the moment a single fertilsed egg splits in two to create identical twins; explore the intricate processes that occur in the womb to shape two supreme predators - the lion and the domestic cat; reveal the first stages of life of the dog and its common ancestor the wolf; and encounter reproduction and gestation at its most extreme including the embryonic shark that turns cannibalistic and the wasp that hijacks the bodies of others for the development of its young. From the bizarre to the breath-taking, four unique journeys that unlock the secrets of fetal development and reveal life in the womb, as it's never been seen before.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:03:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-06-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>04:28:00</td></tr></table>
