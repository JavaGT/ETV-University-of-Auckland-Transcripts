India&rsquo;s BJP-led government says its final budget before a general election in 2024 will spur economic growth, but opposition politicians are among critics who say it fails to address ever-deepening income and wealth inequality highlighted by anti-poverty groups.

The $550bn budget introduced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 includes income tax cuts for the middle class and infrastructure spending aimed at creating jobs. But it does not include the re-introduction of a wealth tax on the rich that campaigners say would dramatically improve the lives of poor people in the world&rsquo;s fifth-largest economy.

Sitharaman says &ldquo;the budget makes the need once again to ramp up the virtuous cycle of investment and job creation&rdquo;, but a senior leader from the opposition Congress Party said it fails to address &ldquo;concerns about life, livelihood and the growing inequality between the rich and the poor&rdquo;. More than 80% of people questioned in a 2022 survey by Fight Inequality said they approved on higher taxes on the rich and corporations.

Oxfam India recently called for action to shrink the huge gap between India&rsquo;s richest and poorest people, as it points to a major rise in the number of Indian billionaires between 2020 and 2022. Its report &ldquo;Survival of the Richest&rdquo; says that 60 percent of the country&rsquo;s wealth is held by the richest five percent of citizens, while only three percent is owned by the least-wealthy half of the population. Among its recommendations are immediate wealth taxes and windfall taxes on billionaires, as well as easing the tax burden on poor and marginalised people.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-02-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
