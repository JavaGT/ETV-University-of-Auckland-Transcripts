Wilhelmina Shrimpton, the host of The Core, sits down with two young ram raiders to get an insight into what drives them to crime. One was 14 and the other just 12 years old when they were targeting dairies, liquor stores and vape shops across Auckland. They're open and honest about their upbringing, and how after months of ram raids, they want to turn their lives around.
