Sperm donation can turn the dream of creating a family into a reality for single women, and straight and queer couples around the country. But the demand for sperm has skyrocketed to a point where fertility clinics simply cannot keep up. Waitlists can be two to three years long, costs run into thousands of dollars, and hopeful parents worry about time running out. It&rsquo;s a situation that&rsquo;s pushed sperm donation out of the medical field and into the hands of DIY donors &ndash; where the online world is ripe for exploitation, control and deceit.

Canada on Fire
Canada continues to burn &ndash; in the grip of the worst forest fires in recorded history. Since late April, an area of almost 14 million hectares has been scorched by wildfires. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and the Canadian government deployed its armed forces to deal with the crisis. 5000 international firefighters were flown in to help, including more than 90 New Zealanders, in the battle to save lives and homes.
