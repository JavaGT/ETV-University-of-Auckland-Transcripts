G In a London courtroom late last year, 38-year-old Jemma Mitchell was found guilty of a despicable crime. She&rsquo;d murdered her friend, Mee Kuen Chong, chopped up her body, stuffed it into a suitcase and dumped it near a remote English beach. The evidence against Mitchell was overwhelming: multiple CCTV cameras showed her wheeling the suitcase around London. But there&rsquo;s now a twist. In an extraordinary interview, Mitchell&rsquo;s mother claims her daughter is innocent and she saw what was really packed into the suitcase. Channel 9 &lsquo;60 Minutes&rsquo;

SURVIVING SLAVERY
G An estimated 50 million people worldwide are slaves &ndash; forced to work for little or no pay. In Aotearoa, we might like to imagine that slavery is non-existent, but this isn&rsquo;t the case. A small number of slavery cases in our horticultural and retail industries have made it to court, but it&rsquo;s thought to be more common than those cases would indicate. The government laid out an action plan two years ago &ndash; so why do critics say it falls short? This week, Sunday speaks to those who&rsquo;ve been on the receiving end: shockingly, living as slaves in New Zealand.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:01:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Magazine, News, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Health, History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-05-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:03:00</td></tr></table>
