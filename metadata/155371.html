About series:
From executive producers Mark and Jay Duplass (Togetherness, Room 104) comes a third season of HBO&rsquo;s half hour adult animated series. Focusing on the downtrodden creatures native to Earth&rsquo;s least-habitable environment: New York City, all voiced by a who&rsquo;s-who of talent from TV, music and comedy including Tracy Morgan, Anthony Mackie and Tatiana Maslany. Whether it&rsquo;s lovelorn rats, gender-questioning pigeons or aging bedbugs in the midst of a midlife crisis, the awkward small talk, moral ambiguity and existential woes of non-human urbanites prove startlingly similar to our own.

Starring Tracy Morgan (30 Rock), Anthony Mackie (Avengers: Infinity War), Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black), Jared Harris (Mad Men), Paul Rust (Love), Demi Moore (Empire), John Leguizamo (Bloodline), Moby, Johnny Knoxville (Jackass), Michael Sheen (Masters of Sex), Marcia Clark and many more.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:26:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Animation, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Biology, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-08-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
