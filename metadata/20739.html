Travis Burns mercilessly bashed Joanne to death in front of her 11-month-old baby and a friend's child.  But there was to be justice for Joanne. She'd fought bravely, scratching Burns chest, getting his skin and DNA under her fingernails. On Beyond the Darklands, Nigel Latta looks into the life of Travis Burns to try and understand what drove him to such an horrific act against someone so innocent and undeserving.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-03-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:25:00</td></tr></table>
