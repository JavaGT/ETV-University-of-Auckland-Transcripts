Composition, orbital inclination and period of rotation of Mars are very similar to that of Earth. However because the atmosphere of Mars is on average 100 times thinner than that on Earth, the red planet experiences extreme weather. Global dust storms regularly engulf the planet for months at a time. This dynamic atmosphere is primarily driven by solar heating and exaggerated terrain, while the low atmospheric pressure results in a faster 'relaxation time' of the atmosphere, yielding highly repeatable seasonal variation. &lt;br&gt; We have developed a numerical weather prediction model of the Martian atmosphere based on the MM5 Earth forecasting model (commonly used to produce the regional weather forecasts seen on the evening news). Using this model we are able to simulate global and regional weather patterns on Mars. Studying the weather on Mars has applications such as determining safe landing sites on Mars for spacecraft. Understanding the atmospheric dynamics of the Martian atmosphere will also help us to better understand the weather and climate evolution of Earth.&lt;br&gt; Featuring David Wing - PhD student in Physics at the University of Auckland.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Astronomy, Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2007-07-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
