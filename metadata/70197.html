This animation shows the average yearly change in mass, as measured by the NASA/German Aerospace Center Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission.

The animation shows ice loss over the Indian subcontinent, as measured in
centimetres of water, from 2003 to 2010. The yellow circles mark locations of glaciers. There is significant mass loss in this region (denoted by the blue and purple colors), but it is concentrated over the plains south of the glaciers, and is caused by groundwater depletion. A ColorBar overlay shows the range of values displayed.
