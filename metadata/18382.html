This three part documentary series takes viewers into the secretive world of the NZ Police Armed Offenders Squad (AOS). Most Kiwis will only see the Armed Offenders Squad at a distance or on TV - and will be thankful for that. 
 
This elite squad is only called out in worst-case scenarios and in this country we're fortunately free of the high-level of violent crime found elsewhere in the world. Or are we?  Since 2005 the AOS have attended over 600 incidents nationwide every year - and in the past year the number has leapt to over 750. 

 The squad is a barometer of public safety and the black suits are coming out more and more these days. How has violent crime changed in the 45 years since the inception of the Armed Offenders Squad - and how have the ways in which the squad has been deployed changed? This series explores the untold stories behind some of the key moments in our nation's war on crime, as told by the elite police officers that selflessly put themselves in the Line of Fire.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:09:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Law</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-11-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
