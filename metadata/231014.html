This eight-part series stars Helena af Sandeberg as Malou, whose perfect life is on the brink of disaster. But when she finds a bag containing SEK47m (US$5.3m), her fortunes appear to change and she buys a bakery to launder the money. Meanwhile, Liana (Bianca Kronl&ouml;f), who is being chased by a criminal gang looking for the money from the robbery that landed her ex-boyfriend behind bars, takes a job at Malou&rsquo;s bakery.

When viewers first meet Malou, she is on the verge of a breakdown. She is a single mother living beyond her means in an exclusive part of town. When she is declared bankrupt and has her possessions repossessed, she hits rock bottom. Then she finds a bag of money buried in some woods and takes the decision to keep it rather than hand it in to the authorities. Malou is preoccupied with her social status and Instagram posts The character&rsquo;s burgeoning criminal enterprise then hits a snag when, unbeknownst to Malou, she hires someone closely connected to the missing loot. Dough (Deg in Swedish) is a story of the friendship between Malou and Liana, which also highlights issues of class in Swedish society and the fact that people can be good and bad, with neither woman pitched as either a hero or villain.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:43:32</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Business, Criminology, Drama, Health, Languages, Law, Media Studies, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-06-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
