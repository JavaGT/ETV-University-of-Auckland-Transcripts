For nearly 30 years, Arts on Tour has been connecting some of New Zealand&rsquo;s biggest entertainers with rural audiences, providing the cultural lifeline of live performance to small communities across the motu. But funding cuts are now threatening to halt these shows that have, for so long, contributed to the social wellbeing of towns from Kaitaia to Invercargill. Sunday&rsquo;s Mark Crysell ventures to Southland to hear from locals who reckons this is yet another example of how people in regional Aotearoa are being left high and dry.

SAFE SETS
The idea of safety on a film set is usually associated with stunt work, but in the wake of the #MeToo movement, a new kind of safety is being prioritised. For decades actors have had to just muddle through when it came to performing love scenes. At one end of the scale it might be a bit embarrassing, at the other: traumatising. This week, we report from the star-studded set of &lsquo;Creamerie&rsquo; where some well-known actresses are taking the risk out of intimacy.

I, SPY?
The murky business of espionage usually exists in the shadows. But, this week a woman accused of being a Russian agent comes in from the cold. Marina Sologub was, until earlier this year, living and working in Adelaide. Now she&rsquo;s in immigration detention waiting to be kicked out of the Australia. Cases like this would normally be kept top secret, but Sologub is refusing to go quietly.
