This is the system we currently use to elect our Parliament.

There are 120 Members of Parliament (MPs). There are 71 electorates, including the Maori electorates. Each elects one MP, called an Electorate MP. The other 50 MPs are elected from political party lists and are called List MPs.

Each voter gets two votes.

The first vote is for the political party the voter chooses. This is called the party vote and largely decides the total number of seats each political party gets in Parliament.

The second vote is to choose the MP the voter wants to represent the electorate they live in. This is called the electorate vote. The candidate who gets the most votes wins. They do not have to get more than half the votes.

Under current MMP rules, a political party that wins at least one electorate seat OR 5% of the party vote gets a share of the seats in Parliament that is about the same as its share of the party vote. For example, if a party gets 30% of the party vote it will get roughly 36 MPs in Parliament (being 30% of 120 seats). So if that party wins 20 electorate seats it will have 16 List MPs in addition to its 20 Electorate MPs.

Coalitions or agreements between political parties are usually needed before Governments can be formed.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:02:05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, New Zealand, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-09-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
