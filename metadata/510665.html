This week on On The Rise, we meet the very groovy Lou'ana
With her super soulful voice and vibey, upbeat tunes, you might just feel like dancing.

Next week officially marks the start of winter, and we're celebrating with Beat That: Coldest Winter Dip!
Be brave, send us a clip of your swim (and the temperature!) to our webpage, and you could be in to win a $500 @swanndrinz voucher to warm things back up.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:31:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, Magazine, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-05-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
