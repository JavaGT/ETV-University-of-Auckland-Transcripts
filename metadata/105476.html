Campbell Live finishes with a brilliant team of producers, reporters, camera operators, editors and managers &ndash; some leaving TV3 and some staying. For the last time ever, John Campbell and the team have filled that quintessential 7pm time slot. 

The problem with a show named 'Campbell Live' is that it doesn't sufficiently stress the extent to which we've been a team, and through our 10 years on air, there have many, many brilliant people. 'Campbell Live' finishes with a brilliant team of producers, reporters, camera operators, editors and managers &ndash; some leaving TV3 and some staying. John Campbell started working at TV3 aged 27 in a suit he borrowed from his father &ndash; he never dreamed what would happen over the next 24 years.

Between everyone who has passed through the 'Campbell Live' office, we've made somewhere approaching 2,500 programmes, five nights a week and often from scratch. Tonight, if you're watching in Christchurch, chances are we've interviewed you, and you're trust is something we will never forget. May your city be magnificent. To the families those were brave enough to let us in for stories of child poverty, thank you. And to the Pike River families, thank you. And to those who came to us because you thought that we could make a difference, thank you. To the people who donated so much money, so often, because you saw the same need we saw, thank you. Food in schools, disaster relief in the Philippines and Vanuatu and Gaza, new homes, new hope, better lives &ndash; you supported it all the way.
Thank you and ka kite ano, New Zealand.
