Judith Butler is a post-structuralist philosopher and queer theorist. She is most famous for her notion of gender performativity, but her work ranges from literary theory, modern philosophical fiction, feminist and sexuality studies, to 19th- and 20th-century European literature and philosophy, Kafka and loss, mourning and war.

She has received countless awards for her teaching and scholarship, including a Guggenheim fellowship, a Rockefeller fellowship, Yale's Brudner Prize, and an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award.

Her books include &quot;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity,&quot; &quot;Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex,&quot; &quot;Undoing Gender,&quot; and &quot;Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable?&quot;
