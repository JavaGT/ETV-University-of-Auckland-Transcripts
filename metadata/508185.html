Anna spoke with organiser of the event, Louise Parsons, and Eastern District Commander Superintendent Jeannette Park, to discuss the vulnerability of residents and what the Police are doing to support them.

National Party Leader Christopher Luxon says if he was in Government, he would have made the same decision to strip Rob Campbell from his role as Te Whatu Ora/Health NZ chair. He says it's important that in the role, the senior official holds to a code of conduct.

When Cyclone Gabrielle struck the East Coast, members of the Punjabi Sikh community in Hastings jumped into action, knowing there would be thousands left hungry. Locals like Harry Kumar from the Ravidass temple have since been preparing hundreds of meals a day for their community.

&ldquo;I made some comments about National's Three Waters policy, which I considered to be wrong and misguided - the policy, not my comments -  I stand by those.&quot; Former Te Whatu Ora/ Health NZ chair Rob Campbell spoke with us this morning after Health Minister Ayesha Verrall stripped him of his role, saying he lacked political neutrality. The decision came after a social media post over the weekend, which saw the former chairman criticising National's policy.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:00:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, News, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-03-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>06:00:00</td></tr></table>
