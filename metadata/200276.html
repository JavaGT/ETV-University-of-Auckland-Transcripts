A former Union Army colonel heads for Texas to recover a shipment of gold bullion stolen from a payroll train during the American Civil War and settle a few old scores along the way. Howard Hawks' Western, starring John Wayne, Jorge Rivero, Christopher Mitchum, Jack Elam, Jennifer O'Neill and Mike Henry. As John Wayne's last film with director Howard Hawks it has a wonderful sense of western occasion, together with a sardonic humour that lights up a listless story. Jorge Rivero and Bob's son, Chris Mitchum, play the Confederate looters snatching Union gold, and Wayne is the colonel trying to find the traitor who's feeding information to the robbers. Meanwhile, wild-eyed Jack Elam looks askance at the whole business. It's leisurely, but the characters and circumstance make a real impression.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:49:13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie, Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Criminology, History, Literature, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Jones</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-01-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:55:00</td></tr></table>
