Aotearoa banned single-use plastic shopping bags four years ago but the war on plastic has a new battleground, the construction industry. From the shrink-wrap covering new builds and renovations to the huge amount of packaging on building products, the amount of plastic waste going directly into landfills from construction sites far exceeds the number of plastic bags we once shopped with. And that&rsquo;s not even counting the amount of plastic we&rsquo;re putting into our new homes. Where do we even start in making a dent in this mountain of waste?

THE PARENT TRAP
It sounds completely crazy, but in Japan it is actually legal to kidnap children. A bizarre law allows a parent in a failed marriage to literally abduct the kids and run off into the night. Co-parenting is not an option for divorced couples and sole custody is automatically awarded to the parent who was last living with the children. Hundreds of kids have been innocently caught up in this mess, and the parent left on the outer - fighting a foreign legal system and their own governments just to see their kids.
