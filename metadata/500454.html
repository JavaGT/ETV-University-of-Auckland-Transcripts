Breaking down the silos &mdash; innovative curriculum for years nine and ten.
Westland High School is a small rural school on the South Island&rsquo;s West Coast. In 2010, we faced challenges in engaging our year nine and ten students, and at the same time roll numbers made providing even class numbers across the two levels difficult. After a process of consultation with the community, students and staff, we adopted a six line trimester programme, with all subjects being broken into courses, whether they were traditionally core or option subjects.
The trimester programme, delivered first in 2011, produced some unanticipated results. Our intention was to broaden our curriculum and deliver more choice for students, working with their parents and a vertical form teacher. The immediate effect, however, was a halving of disciplinary interventions for these levels in the first year, which has been sustained in the years following. Student choice, regular monitoring of achievement and progress, and innovative programmes have led to better alignment of curriculum at these levels to senior programmes, and much improved student engagement.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:48:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-08-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:53:35</td></tr></table>
