About the Series:
A Place in the Sun: Winter Sun is a series dedicated to those looking for an overseas home where they can escape the long, cold British winters.

Generally, every episode on the programme shows a British couple wishing to buy a property in a sunny foreign country are shown three or four places found by the show\\'s researchers. The presenter gives the couple useful local information relating to buying, running and maintaining a property in this particular location. After viewing each property the couple are asked for their opinions. At the end of the show they are asked if they have a favourite property and we\\'re finally told if they went on to buy the property or another in the region.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Business</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>LIVING</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
