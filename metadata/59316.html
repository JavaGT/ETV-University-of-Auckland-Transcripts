With an exclusive interview with Zuckerberg himself and access to Facebook's offices in Silicon Valley and its most senior staff, this documentary tells the story of Zuckerberg's extraordinary rise, and examines his new challenge in combining his idealistic vision of a more open world with the business potential that Facebook now represents. The film explains how Facebook, now said to be worth up to $100 billion, can act as a giant market research database, and it asks what all that time on Facebook is doing to our real-world relationships. As the company heads towards a likely stock market flotation, it's also a timely examination of the threats to Facebook, from Google and others, and of the critical role that Zuckerberg himself plays in determining its prospects.
