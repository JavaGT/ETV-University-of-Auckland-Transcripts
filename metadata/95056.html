Natalie Chandra, a London solicitor, asks Will to defend Martin Newall, an old friend, accused of murdering his secretary and lover but protesting his innocence. Jane is not happy when Will takes the brief on as they had left London years earlier after his last murder case, with Jane leaving behind a successful career as a publisher. The killing of a reclusive farm worker, John Jarrold, takes place near to the Travers' home, and the investigation is led by the hardnosed D.I. Wenborn, who strongly dislikes Will after the barrister showed that one of his men lied in court to get a false conviction.

Injustice is a five-part psychological thriller from acclaimed writer Anthony Horowitz (Collision, Foyle&rsquo;s War). This event drama tackles a universal question...indeed it&rsquo;s at the heart of every country&rsquo;s legal system.
 
How does a defence barrister live with himself if he finds out that his client is guilty? William Travers (James Purefoy) is just such a man. Famous for defending the underdog, he is recovering from a nervous breakdown and the complete uprooting of his family and his work. When we meet him, he is working on low-level cases in rural Suffolk. His life is thrown off balance a second time when he happens to see a figure from the past across a station platform.

At the same time, an old university friend asks him to defend him for a murder he swears he didn&rsquo;t do. Travers finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that stretches far beyond the courtroom while fighting off the forces that may once again destroy him.

Injustice is a complex, nail-biting drama... an examination of morality on many levels. STARRING: James Purefoy (Camelot, Diamonds, Rome, Frankenstein), Dervla Kirwan (The Silence, Material Girl, Law &amp; Order UK) Charlie Creed-Miles (Criminal Justice, Five Days, Skins) and Nat Parker (Lewis, My Family, Land Girls, Hotel Babylon).</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:47</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Law, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-11-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
