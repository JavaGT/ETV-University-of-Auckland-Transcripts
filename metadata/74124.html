Ever not felt completely like yourself? There's a good reason for that. Because a large part of you . . . isn't you. Our bodies are home to ten times as many microbes as human cells. We are walking ecosystems, each of us home to thousands of different species on and inside of us. Meet your microbiome!

Sure, some bacteria are dangerous, but without our tiny friends we wouldn't be here (literally). Enjoy this introduction to your microbiome, and let me know in the comments if you'd like to know more about any part of your personal ecosystem!
