Viewers will learn about N-type and P-type semiconductors and the major features of each, such as charge carriers and holes. They will also see PN diodes and NPN transistors and find out how they work in terms of their semiconductor structure. Finally viewers will come to understand just how widespread the use of semiconductors is in our modern electronic society; from computer chips, to LED lights and solar cells.
