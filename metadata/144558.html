Detroit, the city where General Motors, Ford and Chrysler were once the major employers, was declared bankrupt in 2013 after decades of decline. Over one million citizens left the city, and &quot;Motown&quot; soon became &quot;ghost town&quot;.

Yet, against the backdrop of urban decay, a few diehards stubbornly keep their businesses running. One of them is the barber, Robert (73), who used to be the hairstylist to many Motown artists.

In his barber shop, the old spirit is still alive. Soul music blares from his jukebox and his customers, mostly over 70 years old, swear by the glam Chuck Berry hairdo.

Barber Shop Detroit tells a story of nostalgia and pride against a background of economic recession and reveals how the past can help people get through the present.

As one customer explains: &quot;If you take care of your hair, your hair will take care of you.&quot;
