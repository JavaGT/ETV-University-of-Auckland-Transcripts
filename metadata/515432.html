The aircraft departed Airbus' facility in Hamburg on Wednesday (Hamburg time) and is expected to arrive in Auckland late Monday evening.

A small team of nine are on board the A321neo which will travel from Hamburg to Auckland via Oman, Kuala Lumpur and Cairns.

The aircraft is longer than the A320s used on domestic and short haul routes and is equipped with cutting edge Pratt &amp; Whitney geared turbo-fan engines which are more efficient and quieter than existing engines, but have suffered teething problems at other airlines, particularly India's IndiGo.

&quot;As with new products there are sometimes infancy issues as the engine matures and no engine is immune to those things. I think now they've reached a reasonably high level of maturity and reliability,&quot; he said.

The aircraft, with the tail registration ZK-NNA, is expected to enter commercial service on 23 November operating flight NZ739 from Auckland to Brisbane.
