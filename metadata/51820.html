By the of age 30, while already running his own business, Scott hires him to build a bridge over the Mississippi river to link East and West in a way never before thought possible by train. Carnegie agrees, but doesn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll build a bridge strong enough. Carnegie's doubt is quelled when he finds his answer in steel. Before Carnegie realizes the full potential of steel, his mentor Scott dies in a state of humiliation at the hands of John D Rockefeller s oil pipeline. Carnegie vows to have his revenge and best Rockefeller.
