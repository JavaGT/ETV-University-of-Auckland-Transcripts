'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was Nirvana's first and biggest hit, reaching number six on the 'Billboard Hot 100' and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992. 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an &quot;anthem for apathetic kids&quot; of Generation X but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Kurt Cobain's death, listeners and critics have continued to praise 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.
