Directed and produced by seven-time Emmy-winner Amy Schatz, In the Shadow of the Towers: Stuyvesant High on 9/11 offers a unique eyewitness perspective on that tragic day and its aftermath from former Stuyvesant students.

The film revisits the events of 9/11 through conversations with eight Stuyvesant alumni who, as teenagers, lived through the attack and whose lives were forever changed by it. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t really talk about the fact that there were kids there,&rdquo; says Himanshu Suri. The former students recall a normal, sunny day, one of the first days of the school year, suddenly interrupted by disaster. &ldquo;Absolutely everything changed that day,&rdquo; recounts Ilya Feldsherov, who was 17 at the time.

The film&rsquo;s subjects describe the chaos of the day &ndash; witnessing the planes crash, fleeing from the encroaching dust cloud from the towers&rsquo; collapse, and their harrowing journeys home, often miles away in the city&rsquo;s outer boroughs, including Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. Representing students from various immigrant communities and backgrounds, the participants speak about the backlash against minorities that followed the attack and the deep friendships with classmates that got them through.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-09-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
