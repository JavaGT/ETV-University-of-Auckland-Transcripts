Dimbleby embarks on a 6000-mile journey through Brazil, the continent's largest country and home to 190 million people. Nowhere is evidence of the economic boom in South America more apparent, but Jonathan finds the road to riches is paved with dilemmas for both Brazil and the wider world. In the Amazon, architects and cattle ranchers are grappling with environmental tension. On the coast, descendants of runaway slaves are fighting the expansion of a satellite launch facility to protect their land. And in Rio, Jonathan joins the commander of a new police force as they seek to pacify the slums ruled by the law of the drug lords.

After his journeys across Russia and Africa, Jonathan Dimbleby turns his attention to South America. Once notorious for drugs and dictators, the continent still faces daunting challenges but Dimbleby also finds energy and optimism in this 21st century New World. From the Andes to the Amazon, in thriving cities, on the slopes of dramatic mountains and in the deepest jungles, he meets the people who are building the new South America. In this first episode, Dimbleby heads to Chile to discover how it has transformed since the demise of General Pinochet.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:03:11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Criminology, Economics, Geography, History, Political Studies, Sociology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-10-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
