They made history as the first all-female band that both wrote their own songs and played their own instruments to top the Billboard album charts.

The Go-Go's rose to fame during the early 1980s. Their debut album, Beauty and the Beat, is considered one of the &quot;cornerstone albums of (US) new wave&quot; (Allmusic), breaking barriers and paving the way for a host of other new American acts. When the album was released, it steadily climbed the Billboard 200 chart, ultimately reaching number one, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. The LP sold in excess of three million copies and reached triple platinum status, making it one of the most successful debut albums ever. The Go-Go's have sold more than seven million albums.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Documentary, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-12-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:40:00</td></tr></table>
