Uzbekistan is the most populace Central Asian country and has the largest armed forces. There is no real internal opposition and the media is tightly controlled by the state. Long-term leader Islam Karimov tolerates no opposition; political and rights activists have fled. He shows no signs of giving up power A UN report has described the use of torture as &quot;systematic&quot;. 

Uzbekistan is one of the world's biggest producers of cotton and is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold. However, rigid political control is mirrored in the tightly centralised planning of the economy. Economic reform has been painfully slow and poverty and unemployment are widespread. 

Many countries keep Uzbekistan at arm's length over its rights record. The European Union imposed sanctions after the crackdown on unrest in Andijan when troops opened fire on protesters against the jailing of people charged with Islamic extremism. Witnesses reported a bloodbath with several hundred civilian deaths. The Uzbek authorities put the overall toll at less than 190.
