Chelsea New Zealand's Hottest Home Baker, TV3's popular baking contest is back and sweeter than ever! It returns to our screens with tougher challenges, new contestants and a new judge, who believes that baking is not simply an art but a science.

Hosted by Colin Mathura-Jeffree, the series features amateur bakers from across New Zealand competing each week in challenges which test taste, innovation and presentation. Looking on are our expert judges - international baker and patissier, Dean Brettschneider and food scientist Julia Crownshaw, co-creator and owner of award-winning Dollop Puddings.

Each week the finalists face themed challenges and this year we are mixing it up by looking for expert finesse just as much as brilliant basic skills. Can the finalists get their bread to rise perfectly? Will their signature dishes take the cake? Will the puddings challenge be bitter-sweet for all?

From adapting judges' recipes to making up their own, each episode holds a fresh and delicious challenge testing the contestants' versatility and composure while baking against the clock.

Watch each week as the pressure builds and the cookies begin to crumble, to see who the judges will vote as the 'best baker' for the week, and who will be asked pack up their wooden spoons and head home.

Only one can win the much coveted title of Chelsea New Zealand's Hottest Home Baker. They take home: a baker's trip of a lifetime to Singapore, compliments of Mondo Travel, flying Singapore airlines, staying at the Park Royal Hotel and training under judge Dean Brett Schneider at his artisan eatery, Baker &amp; Cook; a brand new kitchen from Kitchen Mania with a Mico sink and tap-ware; appliances from Fisher &amp; Paykel and Breville; bake-ware from Stevens; and a selection of Chelsea Sugar products.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Food Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-04-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
