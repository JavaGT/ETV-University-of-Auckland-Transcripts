On Friday, Campbell Live was with cabbie Sunny Singh as he went about his job at the Auckland International Airport taxi rank.
Sunny is one of hundreds of drivers who are simply trying to provide for their families.
Some people emailed in and said Sonny should give up being a cabbie. He'd love to, but he's tried to get other work and he can't. We're pretty sure the people who emailed us don't want Sunny to go on the dole.
So, he drives a cab - or, he did. From tonight, the company he works for, President Taxis, no longer has a contract with the international airport.
Business is so tight for smaller companies at the airport that some cabbies are protesting to the extent of going on hunger strike. It's both extremely serious and terribly sad that things have reached that stage.
Sunny is upset because the cost of working out of the airport is so great that drivers with the smaller companies are struggling to make a living out of it.
But the airport's a business, not a philanthropic trust. Is that their concern?
Campbell Live met with Richard Barker, the airport's general manager, commercial and retail, to discuss the cabbie's lot.

Feeding kids through school gardens.
We've heard what the Children's Commissioner's report says - one in six Kiwi children are going to school each day without food.
But at some schools they're leaving with bellies full of healthy food, and the skills they need to keep their own families provided for one day.
The garden-to-table programme is a return to old fashioned gardening lessons, but it's far from the days of boiled cabbage.
Rebecca Wright visited a school where the veges are cooked in an outdoor pizza oven.

Behind the scenes at the foodbank.
We've done a little but we need to do a lot more - that's an overly simplified summary of a special report from the Children's Commissioner into child poverty.
Up to 265,000 or a quarter of Kiwi children live below the poverty line.
The expert advisory group the Commissioner set up reported that the most urgent problems needed to be dealt with by the Government
Working for Families and the family tax credit were two areas it suggested changes for.
This is a report that was not funded by the Government, but a Wellington philanthropic trust has provided $500,000 to keep a closer eye on child poverty.
Aside from the politics of the report what's the day-to-day reality?
Tristram Clayton spent a couple of days at a foodbank observing the families that have struggled to the point where they have to make that difficult decision to ask for a hand-out from the foodbank.
