A: You use sound. People want to know the shape and composition of the vast seafloor around New Zealand for a host of reasons. For example: some want to find minerals,some want to know about natural hazards like submarine volcanoes, offshore faultlines, and landslides which could cause tsunamis, and some want to know where unique animals and plants live. &lt;br&gt; NIWA maps the seafloor by using sound waves. Pulses of sound are sent out as a fan of 135 separate beams from a ship's hull to the seafloor. The time taken for a sound pulse to travel from the ship and reflect from the seafloor back to the ship gives the water-depth. This type of information is also being used to produce marine habitat maps. Physical variables, like water-depth, substrate type, sea-surface temperature, and tidal and bottom current flow all have a profound effect on the distribution and type of marine ecosystems and biodiversity. &lt;br&gt;Featuring Ian Wright - Marine Geologist with the National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and Miles Dunkin, a GIS Technician with NIWA.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History, New Zealand, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
