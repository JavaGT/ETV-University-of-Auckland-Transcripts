Nevertheless, treating light as a classical electromagnetic wave rather than as a quantum field (composed of photons) still proves to be adequate in many situations. In fact, quantum field effects remained challenging to observe until the last decade of the twentieth century. &lt;br&gt; In one such recent observation, experiments were carried out with light and a hundred or so atoms interacting inside a small optical cavity, the cavity formed by an opposing pair of highly reflecting mirrors (an example of so-called cavity quantum electrodynamics or cavity QED). In these experiments, a pair of photodetectors look for correlations in the times at which photons are emitted from the cavity. The sign of the correlation (negative rather than positive or photon antibunching) cannot be explained without using quantum mechanical ideas. &lt;br&gt; Despite the successful experimental demonstration of the effect in the early 1990s, a discrepancy between theory and experiment remained unexplained for more than ten years: the observed effect was smaller than expected by a factor of 3 to 4. The primary aim of the work described in the video is to explain the discrepancy and construct a theoretical model of the physical system that predicts the experimental result. &lt;br&gt; Science is built upon the quantitative agreement between what we observe and the theory put forward to provide an understanding of what we observe. Persistent disagreement means there is something wrong with our understanding. An important part of the scientific method is the resolution of such disagreement, an example of which you will see in this video. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Howard Carmichael - Professor of Physics at the University of Auckland and Felipe Dimer de Oliveira and Rob Fisher - graduate students in Physics at the University of Auckland.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2007-07-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
