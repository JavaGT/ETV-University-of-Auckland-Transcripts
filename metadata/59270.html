'Sunday at 5' tells the story of Northern Ireland's troubles through the memories of two ex-prisoners - former Loyalist Billy McQuiston and former Republican Seanna Walsh. Filmed in 2008, this documentary explores the complexities of the 'peace process' in ten-year hindsight, as experienced both inside and outside of prison. Throughout, the director cross-cuts between archive footage and interviews with subjects such as prison wardens, relatives and mediators.
