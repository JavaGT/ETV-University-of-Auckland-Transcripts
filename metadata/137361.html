About the Series:
Six famous faces are challenged to a dietary experiment &ndash; going cold turkey on sugar for two weeks, while living and working together at Laverstoke Park Farm. And when we say &lsquo;cold turkey&rsquo;, there wasn&rsquo;t a single grain of sugar available during their stay.

Going cold turkey from sugar can be seriously tough and Sugar Free Farm sets out to put this to the test. Six famous faces undergo a dietary experiment: living entirely without sugar for two weeks. Turning their backs on the modern food industry, they live and work on a country farm in return for their share of healthy, wholesome food. Breaking their addiction to sugar will push their bodies to the limits.
 
Embarking on the radical regime are musical theatre star Jane McDonald, comedian Rory McGrath, quiz mastermind and Chaser Mark Labbett, actress Tupele Dorgu, TOWIE&rsquo;s James &lsquo;Arg&rsquo; Argent and dancer Jennifer Ellison.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:03:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science, Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2016-10-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
