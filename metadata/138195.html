One of the issues Widad feels most strongly about is the social inequalities that begin at school - her next assignment for the blog.

For Widad's investigation, she travels around the suburbs of Paris, where she meets locals, teachers and students, while trying to track down the national education minister for an all-important interview.

In an area where one in five people are out of work - double the national average - Widad sees education as key to empowering so many dispossessed youth, as it did in her own experience.

The blog was started after the 2005 Paris riots, the worst in France for decades.

Against the backdrop of the 10-year anniversary, Widad tries to investigates the deep social issues that exist in France's suburbs today but faces challenges beyond her control.
