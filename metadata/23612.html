In a war when so many dead were lost or simply dumped into shallow graves, the Trench Detectives come across a body buried with care on a battlefield where tens of thousands of soldiers died in 1915.  As forensic scientists struggle to decipher the engravings on the soldier's corroded ID tag, another team of experts tease apart a leather pouch the man was carrying. 

In it are three rings: A pair of matching rings each inscribed with a surname and a date and a third ring that bears the Iron Cross - keepsakes with meaning for this fallen soldier. An intensive investigation with many twists and turns finally yields the identity of the Fallen, bringing the trench detectives face to face with his descendants.

'Finding the Fallen' is a UK-based documentary TV series in which a team of archaeologists, historians and forensic experts work to identify unknown World War I soldiers and finally lay them to rest. This UK original series  follows the work of 'The Trench Detectives' as they move through time and across the battlefields of France and Belgium, releasing the fallen from the mud of the battles in which they fought and died. Using geophysical surveys and wartime maps they try to locate the original trenches, finding bones, shreds of uniforms, personal effects and the remnants of war to help them identify the fallen soldiers. By doing so they reveal the personal histories of named soldiers and cast light on the human nature of war.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Geography, History, Sociology, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-06-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:30:00</td></tr></table>
