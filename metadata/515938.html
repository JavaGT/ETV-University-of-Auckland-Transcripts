The facility will be occupied by New Zealand&rsquo;s largest privately owned logistic company, Cardinal Logistics, on a 30-year initial lease term. 

Cardinal Logistics provides multiple services to customers, including transport, container storage, freight forwarding, and third-party logistics. This scope maximises Cardinal's operational capability and provides a superior experience for some of the country&rsquo;s largest produce, goods, and materials suppliers.  

Cardinal was started in 1992 and now employs 500 staff across twelve operational sites. Two of these sites are currently owned by Mackersy Property syndicates (Waterloo Park, Christchurch &amp; Tidal Road, Auckland), and we are proud to again align with Cardinal on powering their continued expansion in the logistics market.
