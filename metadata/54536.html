Rev Hirini Kaa uncovers the true stories of the Māori prophets who rose to prominence in times of great change, becoming an incredible part of our nations history.

'The Prophets'. The Māori prophets are an incredible part of our nation's history. The Prophets is a fascinating seven-part series presented by Anglican Priest and historian, Reverend Hirini Kaa. From the time the Bible began to be widely translated into te reo Māori in the 1830s through to the middle of the 20th century, the show chronicles the lives, beliefs and social conditions that saw these messianic figures rise from within Māori communities. Starting with leaders like Papahurihia, the first prophet to draw on Māori and Christian doctrine, emerging with a new form of traditional Māori spirituality to more well-known prophets (Te Kooti, Te Whiti and Tohu and Ratana), The Prophets unveils an incredible part of our nation&rsquo;s history.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Maori, New Zealand, Philosophy, Religion & Theology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
