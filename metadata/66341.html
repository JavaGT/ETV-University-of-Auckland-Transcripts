The multi-award winning series, renowned for its hard-hitting investigative reports, is part of a range of new world-class programming which will screen on the free-to-air network as part of a studio volume deal with CBS Studios International.

The multi-year deal gives Prime exclusive free-to-air broadcasting rights in New Zealand to a broad range of new series that the Hollywood studio produces from the start of the new US television season in the fall of 2012, from network drama to comedy and factual programming including 60 Minutes.

60 Minutes is Primes first foray into current affairs programming and as such we have made a considerable investment to ensure the content will not only live up to current fans expectations but offer compelling and relevant content for new viewers, said Prime Channel Manager, Kathy Wright.

Im delighted to have Belinda Henley on board as Producer, and she and her team have been working to ensure a strong mix of New Zealand and international content that will continue to build on the series popularity in this market, she said.

Ms Wright said New Zealand stories will be an important feature of 60 Minutes and the production team are working with a number of local content providers to offer a diverse selection of stories from reporters from across New Zealand.

Producer Belinda Henley, a 15-year veteran of news and current affairs reporting for a range of international broadcasters including Reuters, CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera English, is excited to be working on 60 Minutes.

Since its first airing 1968, 60 Minutes has provided the benchmark for current affairs reporting. It is a show I have always admired and respected as a broadcaster and enjoyed as a viewer. I am hugely excited at the opportunity to be involved in 60 Minutes as it makes its new home on Prime, she said.

While we will be staying true to the brand, its values and all it stands for, we will also be putting our own stamp on it with our local content and the journalists we use to deliver those stories, said Ms Henley.

Prime has also confirmed Charlotte Bellis, weekend anchor of Prime News: First at 5.30, will host 60 Minutes for the network alongside her news duties. Screening details will be released early in 2013</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>News, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-09-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
