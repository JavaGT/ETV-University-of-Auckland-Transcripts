Belief examines the 2007 death of young Wainuiomata mother Janet Moses during an attempted exorcism. The film uses a blend of interviews and reenactments to explore a tragedy which director David Stubbs believes was caused by &quot;fear and love mixing and turning into hysteria&quot;. The case was reported around the world. In 2009 five members of Janet&rsquo;s close family were charged in relation to her death. 

David Stubbs, himself from the isolated Wellington suburb, has re-told those events with a nuanced, careful film - which had it's first television airing as part of Sunday Theatre - which he entitled Belief because he said it portrayed people who genuinely believed they were doing the right thing.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:34:13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori, Media Studies, New Zealand, Psychology, Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2016-10-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
