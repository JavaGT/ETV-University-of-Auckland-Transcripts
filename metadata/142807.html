He said after the crash that he immediately knew he was in trouble. &quot;I thought 'this was it' ... I feel a bit lucky. 

&quot;I felt quite an intense vibration that got worse and worse, and the machine started to rotate so I just carried out what I considered to be the normal emergency procedures &ndash; and got away with it.&quot;

He was pleased that two kayakers had paddled out to check on him.
