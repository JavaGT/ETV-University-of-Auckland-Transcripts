Harvest Electronics &ndash; From Monitoring Soft Drink Dispensers to Milk Vats
Harvest Electronics started in a garage in 1990 making devices for monitoring Coca Cola vending machines. That business was sold in 2000 and the company started over, firstly developing frost alarms for orchardists. Today it has its own manufacturing and assembly plant and produces its own circuit boards to control a number of failsafe/alarm/alert electronic monitors especially for orchard and farm use. These include an effluent irrigator monitor, soil moisture sensor and vat monitor. Comprehensive weather stations are also available and a cowshed &ldquo;dashboard&rdquo; that allows milkers to keep an eye on effluent disposal, the vat, hot water temperature, weather etc, is under development.
