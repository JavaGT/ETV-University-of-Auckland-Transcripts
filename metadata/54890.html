Amy Peacock believes farm managers can care for land and stock just as well as those who own it. &quot;We farm this property as if it's our own,&quot; says Amy, whose husband Nick manages Anewa Station, a Maori trust property inland from Wairoa. &quot;After all, it's home for us, it's what we wake up to every day and have invested our lives in.&quot; She says some people believe a manager won't care as much as an owner - &quot;But if that's the case, I believe you have the wrong manager.&quot;

Anewa is run by a seven-member board on behalf of around 4,000 shareholders. Taking on the manager's job was a big step up for Nick. Anewa has around 10,000 stock units, more than twice the number on the family farm he previously managed in Central Hawke's Bay. But Nick says Anewa was just the challenge the young couple were looking for. Together, the board and Nick are carrying out an ambitious development programme on the 1900 hectare property. Nick's already done a lot of work on tracks and fences, changed the breed of sheep farmed on the property, put in new water dams and moved to six-monthly shearing.

But the biggest, and most expensive, job is clearing kanuka and manuka that is encroaching on grazing land. Nick brings in helicopters to spray the bigger trees and hires scrub-cutters to deal to the smaller ones. He's careful to keep spray away from waterways and leaves plenty of trees to provide shade for stock and stop erosion. But he says controlling the rest of the scrub is essential if the country is to be farmed. &quot;Manuka and kanuka grow exceptionally well in the warm, moist climate here,&quot; he says. &quot;One of my neighbours has been back home for 14 years and he's had to clear some blocks three times.&quot;

Most of the stock-work on Anewa Station is done on horseback although neither Nick nor Amy rides a conventional East Coast station hack. Nick got his horse, Harvey, as an unbroken five-year-old, while Amy's horse, Kama, is an ex-racehorse. Amy helps out with farm work whenever she can, although she spends most of the week away from Anewa, working for Ag ITO, the agriculture industry training organisation. Amy's job is to visit trainee farm workers or managers who are studying for qualifications in agriculture. In the past, Nick always wanted to own his own farm, but working at Anewa has changed his outlook. &quot;I'm more than happy managing a large scale property like Anewa,&quot; he says. &quot;After living and working here, I'm not sure if going onto a smaller property that we might be able to afford one day, is where my heart lies.&quot;
