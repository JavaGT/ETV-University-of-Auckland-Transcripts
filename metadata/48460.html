At the time her father shook his head resignedly and told her she had been cursed. He called it the Makutu. 

25 years later, when three of her daughters each lost a son in the same tragic way in the same year, the word Makutu was spoken again. It would be many long years, another three deaths in the family, and an extraordinary relationship with a New Zealand geneticist before they learned the real reason for their loss, before the shadow of the Makutu was lifted.
