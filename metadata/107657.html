About Series 7:
Golden Globe Award nominee Simon Baker as Patrick Jane, is an independent consultant with the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI), who has a remarkable track record for solving serious crimes by using his razor sharp skills of observation. 

Within the Bureau, Jane is notorious for his blatant lack of protocol and his semi-celebrity past as a psychic medium, whose paranormal abilities he now admits he feigned. Jane's role in cracking a series of tough, high-profile cases is greatly valued by his fellow agents; however, no-nonsense Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon alternates between reluctantly acknowledging Jane's usefulness and blasting him for his theatrics, narcissism and dangerous lack of boundaries. Lisbon's team includes agents Kimball Cho, Wayne Rigsby and Grace Van Pelt, who all think Jane's a loose cannon but admire his charm and knack for clearing cases.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Law, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-06-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
