After one humiliation too many, he resolves to make a clean start and a dedicated effort to combat the syphilis epidemic. But a blizzard-bound journey to visit a dying patient proves to be his toughest test yet.
 
Jon Hamm and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) star in this wry comedy drama about a young doctor's fledgling career as he begins his new life in a small, backwards Russian village. Based on the semi- autobiographical short stories by Bulgakov, set on the eve of the Russian Revolution, it tells the story of the young medical graduate's turbulent and brutal introduction to his practice, narrated by his older, more experienced self. Dealing not only with the superstitious and poorly educated patients, but also with his own inner demons, the young doctor reveals doubts about his own competence and struggles with the immense burden of medical responsibility. 'A Young Doctor's Notebook' is a fascinating, dark and original, pitch black comedy with renowned international acting talent that will surprise and entertain viewers in a wholly unique way.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:26:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Health, History, Literature, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-09-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:00:00</td></tr></table>
