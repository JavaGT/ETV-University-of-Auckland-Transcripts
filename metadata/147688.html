About series:
The Great British Bake Off returns to Prime for its final season with Mary Berry at the helm, as 12 new amateur bakers don their aprons and head for the iconic tent in the heart of the British countryside. 
The competition begins with cake week. The group first take on a British classic and are then faced with Mary's technical challenge &ndash; a popular little cake with a fatless sponge and tricky chocolate work. Finally, the bakers have the opportunity to show the judges what they can do with their showstopper.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:03:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-10-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
