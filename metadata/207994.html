The company made headlines in 2019 when it performed during Stormzy&rsquo;s bravura Glastonbury set.

This film explores the work of artistic director Cassa Pancho as she nurtures aspiring young dancers and gains recognition for her company&rsquo;s collaborations with world-class choreographers. It also follows the creative process of South African dancer and choreographer Mthuthuzeli November as he creates a dynamic new ballet-inspired in equal measure by Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s seminal Waiting for Godot and African rhythms and language.
