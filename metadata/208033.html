It was the most successful classical concert: 30 years ago, Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jos&eacute; Carreras performed together with Zubin Mehta for the first time as &bdquo;3 Tenors&ldquo; in the thermal baths of Caracalla on the occasion of the Football World Cup in Italy. 1.6 billion spectators watched the concert worldwide &ndash; and it catapulted classical music into a completely new dimension. Just in time for the 30th anniversary, the film &bdquo;Three Tenors &ndash; From Caracalla to the World&ldquo; shows the emotional highlights of the first concert and the sequel in Los Angeles. Previously unpublished backstage material shows the tenors unadorned and offers a fascinating insight into what takes place beyond the spotlight. The film takes a completely new look at the concert legend. For the first time, Placido Domingo, Jos&eacute; Carreras, conductor Zubin Mehta and Luciano Pavarotti&lsquo;s widow Nicoletta Mantovani talk about Jos&eacute; Carreras&lsquo; struggles with leukemia, their rivalries and friendships, their spectacular contract poker and life as an opera star.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:27:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Documentary, Entertainment, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, History, Leadership, Media Studies, Music, Travel & Tourism, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-06-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
