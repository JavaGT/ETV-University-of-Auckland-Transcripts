The Trees for Bees New Zealand campaign was launched in 2009, and aims to enhance pollination on farms and orchards by providing a wider range of forage food sources for bees. The results to date have included research and publication of tree species suitable for planting that provide abundant nectar and high-quality pollen. This is especially important during critical seasons, mainly spring and autumn to help bees resist disease, pests and exposure to pesticides, as well as improve pollination services and the honey flows for apiarists. Eastwoodhill near Gisborne is the National Arboretum containing 1,663 species and more than 5,000 cultivars of mainly northern hemisphere deciduous trees and some NZ natives. The present phase of research work at Eastwood Hill Arboretum is to search for suitable bee fodder in autumn.

Introducing French Genetics to our Sheep Industry
Long-time Romney sheep breeder Murray Rohloff and Poll Dorset and Dorset Horn breeders Peter and Matt Ponsonby have a joint venture breeding company to import, use, multiply and sell genetics from two French sheep breeds, Charollais and Ile de France. They believe both breeds have a lot to offer the NZ sheep industry, the Charollais as a terminal sire for fast-growing, high-yielding lambs on pasture and the Ile de France as a hardy, medium-micron, high-bulk woolled cross with both Merinos and Romneys.

Humates for Improved Production
Humates are organic acids derived from the outer layers of some coal seams. They are used to condition soils and increase plant growth. Mixed with conventional fertilisers they help retain P and N nutrients in the soil and act synergistically to make nutrients more available to plants. In NZ, humates are extracted at the New Vale coal mine near Gore, crushed and shipped around the country. An increasing number of pastoral farmers are using humates to enhance soil fertility and plant production.
