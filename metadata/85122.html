Starring Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil.

France&rsquo;s most expensive film at the time and one of its most successful.

Based on the novel by Marcel Pagnol, it&rsquo;s a kind-of Greek tragedy in a small French village, where a farmer and his uncle (Daniel Auteuil and Yves Montand) scheme to trick a newcomer (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) out of his land and the spring on it.

It was one of Montand&rsquo;s last screen appearances and the movie, and its sequel Manon des Sources, did wonders for tourism in Provence.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:01:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, French</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-07-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
