About series:
Discovery is taking survival to a whole new level with the search for the most talented bushcrafters from across the US. Hosted by primitive skills master Matt Graham, Bushcraft Build-Off is a new competition series where elite builders compete head-to-head in a gruelling, seven-day race against the clock. Each week, two master survivalists test their abilities in different environments, landscapes, and primitive living challenges as they create eye-popping builds, from bridges and weapons, to structures and transportation modes. Using nothing but ingenuity, a few simple hand tools and resources nature provides, the bushcrafters are pushed to the limit mentally, creatively and physically.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Design, Engineering, Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-05-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:25:00</td></tr></table>
