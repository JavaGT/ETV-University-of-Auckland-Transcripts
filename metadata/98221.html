In the second two-hour instalment of The '90s: The Last Great Decade? America becomes ever more divided and fragmented.
About the Series:
The '90s: The Last Great Decade? revisits the decade through &quot;inside out&quot; storytelling and analysis via 120 original interviews&mdash;from unsung heroes behind the decade's most riveting stories to the biggest names in politics, tech, movies and music. They reveal a decade of highs and lows: Bill Clinton swept into office on the promise of change; we all made new &quot;Friends&quot;; the LA Riots kept us glued to our TVs; Nirvana gave Generation X a voice but everyone danced the Macarena; and &quot;The Real World&quot; and Jerry Springer changed the television programming landscape. With a star-studded cast of actors, eyewitnesses, politicians and celebrity interviewees, The '90s tells the story of 10 years before boom turned into bust; 10 years when the Web was wide open; 10 years before global terror hit hard.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:48:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, History, Media Studies, Political Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-08-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
