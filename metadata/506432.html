Who Cares About Polar Bears?

About the show:
Climate change is said to be possibly the worst problem for the human psyche to handle. What is it about the human psychology that creates deniers, despairers and doers? Why is it so hard to get humanity to care enough to do something about climate change compared to other issues? How can we harness behavioural science to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; the human mind into taking action against climate change? Husband-and-wife team Edward Choy and Jo Tan will take viewers through an exploration of cognitive theories, putting participants through experiments and activities. They find out from psychologists how we can hack our brains to change our behaviour. They also speak to businesses, NGOs and individuals who are changing the way they address sustainability in order to encourage more people to take action that helps the planet.
