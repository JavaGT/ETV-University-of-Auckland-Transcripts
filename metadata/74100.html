Though there are plenty of destructive hackers in the world, there have always been people who hack with a different purpose. Some define hacking as &quot;finding creative solutions to technical problems&quot;. To them, hacking means having an exploratory mindset about technology, and a willingness to &quot;get under the hood&quot; to tinker and see what happens. Other groups, like Anonymous, employ more subversive hacking practices to forward social and political causes, embedding a social consciousness into the traditionally murky dark-side of security hacking. Looking beyond the media hype and scare tactics, it is clear that &quot;hacking&quot; is a term whose meaning should be up for debate, and that some hackers could in fact be heroes, and not just villains.
