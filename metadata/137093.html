About the series:

A dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the evolution of sin, exploring a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged.

An ambitious and highly imaginative series, Westworld elevates the concept of adventure and thrill-seeking to a new, ultimately dangerous level. In the not-too-distant future, guests pay exorbitant amounts to be immersed in the Westworld fantasy park universe, where every detail and scenario &ndash; including those involving the android &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; that are virtually indistinguishable from humans &ndash; have been planned, scripted and executed by a team of brilliant scientists and programmers working in close proximity to the park. The hosts, who are regularly updated to make them more lifelike, are programmed to stay in their &ldquo;loops&rdquo; with minimal improvisation, and their memories are erased at the end of each narrative. But it soon becomes apparent that updating a host&rsquo;s thought and behavioural patterns can backfire. 

The one-hour drama features actors Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Evan Rachel Wood, James Marsden, Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright, Rodrigo Santoro, Shannon Woodward, Ingrid Bols&oslash; Berdal, Angela Sarafyan, and Simon Quarterman.
