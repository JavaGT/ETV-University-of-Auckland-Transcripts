The age of the Internet and other information technologies has assisted in the classroom by providing access to a world of knowledge and the tools in which to teach it. Ensuring easy access to education is a key motivator in the education sector, helping to improve the lives of those who previously had little opportunity to learn. Today laptops are distributed to the impoverished, tutors are available online and children in remote areas visit their classroom via webcam. Technology is giving teachers, tutors and lecturers across all levels of education a chance to reach a larger audience and the tools in which to encourage, engage and fascinate pupils.
