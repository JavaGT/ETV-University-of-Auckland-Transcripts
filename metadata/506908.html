In this interview shot for the 2003 season of Give It A Whirl, Devlin covers many topics, including:

The fashion and culture of 1950s rock'n'roll, and how small-town New Zealand reacted to it (starting 3 minutes in)

Moving to Auckland from Whanganui to start a residency at The Jive Centre (9 minutes in)

Cutting his first record (11 minutes)

Recording his own original music (17 minutes)

Major fangirl mania on his New Zealand tours (23 minutes)

How cutting a tendon in his finger probably changed his career (35 minutes)

Bringing the house down in Australia, and touring Australasia with The Beatles (36 minutes)
