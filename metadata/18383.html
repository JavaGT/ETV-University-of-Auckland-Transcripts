The kidnap was witnessed by Jaycee Lee's stepfather, who chased in vain after the car. Eighteen years later, on 24 August 2009, an investigation began that would lead to an astounding discovery: Jaycee Lee Dugard was alive and for the last 18 years had been held captive by a notorious sex offender.
During her captivity, Jaycee Lee had given birth to two daughters, fathered by the sex offender, Phillip Garrido. Jaycee Lee and her daughters had been kept in a maze of tents and sheds in the back garden of Garrido's home in Antioch, California. Featuring interviews with some of those closest to the young Jaycee, including family members, classmates and her headmistress, this documentary also meets the neighbours and business associates of her captor Philip Garrido, and the investigators involved in her case, to piece together one of the most incredible missing person stories of all time. The programme includes an interview with Carl Probyn, Jaycee Lee's stepfather, who witnessed the kidnap. He was the prime suspect in the case for 18 years. His marriage to Jaycee Lee's mother broke up; his life, to all intents and purposes, was ruined. He reveals his story from the day he saw his stepdaughter kidnapped: his anguished 911 call to the police, how the events of the day changed his life forever, and the joy and sadness that engulfed him when he heard she'd been found alive and well.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-11-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
