It's a position of great responsibility - but when done well, it is a genuinely rewarding career. Achieving well in this area however demands a detailed knowledge of how to work safely with children. In this film we examine health and hygiene, safe supervision, safe travel, and health and first aid. Filmed in the workplace, and filled with practical information providing real-world perspectives and examples, this is an engaging look at some of the key skills required in the childcare industry today.
