It features the voices of some of Britain's best actors and at the same time, manages to preserve much of Chaucer's spirited earthiness. Animation styles include ink and pencil drawings, 'claymation' and stencil animation and the tales told are: 'The Pardoner's Tale', 'The Miller's Tale', 'The Reeve's Tale', 'The Nun's Priest's Tale', 'The Knight's Tale', 'The Squire's Tale', 'The Wife of Bath's Tale', 'The Franklin's Tale', 'The Merchant's Tale' and 'The Canon's Servant's Tale'. NB. Refers to adult themes.
