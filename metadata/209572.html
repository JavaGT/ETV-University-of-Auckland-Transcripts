Airing since 1979, this popular programme that has spawned multiple international versions travels across Britain (with occasional trips to other countries, such as Canada and Australia), bringing together in each location specialists in antiques and fine arts to have them appraise items brought in by local residents, whether they are collectors looking to turn trash into treasure or ordinary folks hoping Grandma's old painting might now fund the kids' education. Items featured on the programme often have an interesting story attached to them or have some connection to that episode's venue. While some items that are brought in are worth a fortune, others are worthless.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Design, Economics, History, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-07-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:30:00</td></tr></table>
