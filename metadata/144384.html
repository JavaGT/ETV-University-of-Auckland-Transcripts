About the Series:
Pit Bulls &amp; Parolees is an American reality television series on Animal Planet which confronts the misunderstandings of the Pit Bull breed. 

The series features the Villalobos Rescue Center and was originally located in Agua Dulce, California; however, the organization has relocated to the New Orleans, Louisiana area. It is the United States' largest pit bull animal shelter.

The center's founder, Tia Maria Torres, agreed to be on the show to help pay part of Villalobos' then $25,000 per month bills. Since moving the entire rescue group, including all the dogs, parolees who wanted to go, and her family to New Orleans, the expenses have tripled. They are now $80,000 per month. 

The show's main focus is the interaction between Tia, her dogs, and the parolees who work for her, during daily care and training duties, and pit bull rescue missions.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:52</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Criminology, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ANIMAL PLANET</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
