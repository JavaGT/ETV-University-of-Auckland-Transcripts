Twenty years on from the start of the Iraq war, we look at how the US and UK media helped sell the war to the public.

In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq 20 years ago, United States President George W Bush&rsquo;s administration and its surrogates went into overdrive, pushing the narrative that Iraq, and its leader Saddam Hussein, posed an immediate and significant threat to the US, and the world.

Most of the media in the US and the UK uncritically repeated dubious claims about weapons of mass destruction and possible links to al-Qaeda, claims that were thoroughly debunked in the months and years that followed.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:44</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PG</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-03-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
