With Rose and the team still hard at work in the museum and time running out, Brigid heads into the community to learn about the turbulent 20th century history of the area.
From the late 19th century Devonport was a key strategic military post for the defence of Auckland. Large disappearing guns were installed from the 1880s on both North Head and Mount Victoria. Much of the infrastructure remains but there are also numerous theories about buried planes and munitions in hidden tunnels. Brigid explores the tunnels and discovers more about Devonport&rsquo;s role in both World Wars with archaeologist and historian Dave Veart. To round off the episode and the series, Brigid puts in a request to fire one of the big disappearing guns on North Head, something that&rsquo;s only been done a few times in the hundred or so years since the guns were decommissioned.
