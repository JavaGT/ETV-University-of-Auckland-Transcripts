Lance Corporal Leon Smith was much more than a soldier.
The SAS member died yesterday after being shot in the head during a raid on a compound in Afghanistan's Wardak province, just over an hour from the capital Kabul. The 33-year-old had worked as a lifeguard and a postie and the martial arts expert was also a much-loved family member.

Fears gold kiwifruit could be wiped out
There are warnings gold kiwifruit could disappear from supermarket shelves within two years. The variety is the worst-affected by the vine-killing disease PSA which has been spreading since it was discovered at a Bay of Plenty orchard last November. This month, it has been confirmed in two new Bay of Plenty areas, Katikati and Waihi. Nearly 400 orchards - 17% of the country's crop - are now affected.
Growers have told ONE News gold kiwifruit, which is less resistant to PSA than green kiwifruit, could be off the shelves in as little as two years. Industry leaders have also been reported as saying the disease could take the variety out altogether. But Peter McBride, chairman of Kiwifruit Vine Health - a body set up to try to limit the spread of the disease - does not hold that view.

Shop around for cheap milk, Fonterra says
Cheap milk is available in New Zealand if people shop around, dairy giant Fonterra has told a parliamentary inquiry.
The commerce select committee initiated the inquiry because of public concern about high milk prices and the Fonterra co-operative has carried most of the blame. But Peter McClure, managing director of Fonterra Brand NZ, told the committee today it didn't set retail prices and wasn't in the retail market.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-09-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:59:00</td></tr></table>
