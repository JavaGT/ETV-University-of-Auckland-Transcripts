We look at Te Ao Māori, the Māori world view of the interconnectedness and interrelationship of all living &amp; non-living things. We explore how a Matauranga lens could be applied to marine protection going forward and how traditional and dynamic practices like rahui are able to move more quickly than government policy to protect certain species.

WHAT IS SEASICK?

The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park was the first marine park established in New Zealand. It reaches from Te Arai to Waihi in the North Island, an area of more than 1.2 million hectares which includes more than 50 islands. It is a unique, bio-diverse and a much-loved body of water, but it is in a state of ecological collapse.

Seasick - Saving the Hauraki Gulf is a seven part series initiated by the release of many bleak reports on the state of the gulf. The alarming decrease in crayfish, paua, scallops, fish stocks &ndash; most sealife. How has it come to this? Who are the culprits and what can be done?

Over 18 months we have interviewed more than 70 people &ndash; all with strong, well-informed, points of view.

We investigate the history of fishing, commercial and recreational, fisheries management in general, the Quota Management System and look at marine reserves. Most agree with more marine protection but there is conflict over what that should look like.

It seems apparent that not enough has been done fast enough. Time is running out to save the Hauraki Gulf. There are stories of hope &ndash; we just hope they will be in time.
