It took 70 hours to fly from London to Auckland. The plane is filmed in the air, inside the cockpit and inside the cabin. A lady sips a martini and glances down to get an aerial glimpse of Hastings before the plane lands at Napier. 02.00 Ruatoki, Maori Farmers: Tuhoe farmers at Ruatoki in the Eastern Bay of Plenty use horse-drawn carts to haul their milk to the local cheese factory where production is booming. Ruatoki has two busy general stories where locals can choose from a wide variety of goods. In the last 18 years Maori farmers using loans from the Native De;artment have transformed the Ruatoki valley, cleared the forest, created pasture land and fenced it for stock. Some Maori traditions remain including mat weaving and storing potatoes for the winter. A Maori farmer is shown visiting the commissioner at the local Native Department office while, at the Department store, other farmers draw their supplies of fertlizer. Local Maori school children have a great time driving into a local river. At the Ruatoki High School the biggest problem for the children is said to be learning English because Maori is all that is spoken at home. Students carry out herd testing experiments on their family's milk. Seven marae in the district are still the centre of local life and a hangi is put down for distinguished visitors including Prime Minister Peter Fraser. When the guests arrive they are greeted with traditional welcomes.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:08:03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, History, Maori, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
