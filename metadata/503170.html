The first, conducted by Grissom, Sara, and Greg, involves a dead woman found in a fountain. Although she drowned, the water found in her lungs does not match that of the fountain. The investigation leads the CSIs to a group of swingers who partied with the victim prior to her death. The second case, investigated by Warrick and Nick, involves the death of a landlord in a gaming arcade. The heavy stench in the room leads to the discovery of another body hidden in a gaming booth.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-08-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:30:00</td></tr></table>
