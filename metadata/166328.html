It uncovers a golden decade in surfing, starting in 1956, when surfing was transformed into a sport and culture with its very own music, movies, fashion and heroes. Underpinning this exciting transformation was a small group of artisans who started out in the 1950s making wooden surfboards in their backyards along Sydney's eastern beaches, before eventually moving to Brookvale where they experimented with &quot;blowing foam&quot; to make lighter and more responsive surfboards from plastic. Now, the entrepreneurs and adventurers reflect on the glory years, when they created a culture.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Design, History, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-07-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
