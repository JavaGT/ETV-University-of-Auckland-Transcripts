About the Series:
Imagine if Hunter S. Thompson had a camera instead of a pen. No trite narration. No preconceived ideas. Instead, a journey of discovery.

From the moment Ware and his crew touch down, to the moment they finally find their truth, the viewers are with them. The scenes, the people, will take paths all their own. Unscripted.
