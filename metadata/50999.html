It is hosted by British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.

Format:

The format of the U.S. version of Hell's Kitchen is similar to the United Kingdom, in which Chef Gordon Ramsay under his sole discretion progressively eliminates chefs from a pool of 12 to 18 contestants down to one, the winner, in which he/she is given the opportunity to be the head chef of a high-end restaurant. The aspiring chefs are from various backgrounds and are brought to the Hell's Kitchen restaurant facility in Los Angeles, where they live in the dorms attached to the kitchen facilities during the course of the series. They are introduced to Chef Gordon Ramsay and to the audience typically by cooking their signature dish and presenting to Ramsay for judging. The chefs are subsequently divided into teams, Red and Blue, most often by gender; they are then given a set of utensils (which they keep regardless of their progress), as well as a chef's jacket of their team color (which they must earn the right to keep). The restaurant features two identical kitchens, one for each team, and each are supervised by Ramsay's sous chefs with Ramsay observing both kitchens for quality control. While in Hell's Kitchen, the chefs are given a broad array of cooking lessons, including how to cook some of Ramsay's most difficult dishes such as risotto and Beef Wellington.

Outside of the premiere episode, teams participate in two cooking challenges within each episode. The first challenge is a cooking skill test, ranging from properly preparing the larger number of raw ingredients in a fixed amount of time, preparing new dishes based on limited ingredient selections, a blind tasting test, or preparing a tasting menu for clients.

The winning team of this challenge is given a reward such as a relaxing day away from the restaurant or a prize. The losing team is given a grueling task, such as cleaning both kitchens, doing the restaurant's laundry by hand, or preparing the raw ingredients for the next meal service for both kitchens.

The second cooking challenge is to run a full dinner service, which normally consists of 100 diners split between the two kitchens. Within each team, the chefs are assigned to specific stations, such as meat, appetizers, and garnish. Teams are expected to serve an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert to each diner, with food prepared to Ramsay's strict standards. Ramsay requires that all dishes served to a table be served at the same time, so that if one order is not to his standards, he will normally require the team to re-fire all the dishes for that table. If one chef is having significant difficulties, Ramsay may tell them to leave the kitchen, forcing the rest of the team to cover for their absence. If an entire team is floundering, he will tell the team to &quot;shut it down&quot;, ending their part of the service early; this can happen to both teams at the same time if they are taking too long for the dinner service.
Upon completion of the dinner service, Ramsay will determine which team is the winning team, if there is one, in his opinion or from other metrics, such as which team completed the full service the fastest. From the losing team(s), Ramsay may identify one chef as &quot;the best of the worst&quot; to nominate two other chefs on their team for elimination. In other cases, Ramsay may tell the entire team to come to consensus for whom should be nominated. The chefs are given time to negotiate and discuss the pending nominations in the dorms. On returning to Ramsay while the winning team looks on, the team(s) identify their nominees, but Ramsay is free to identify others he believes should be up for elimination. Those nominated are given the opportunity to justify why they should stay, after which Ramsay names his choice for elimination, whereupon they hand over their chef's jacket and &quot;leave Hell's Kitchen&quot;; they are given an opportunity to say a few last words for the audience. If the elimination should leave a team with two or more less members than the other team, Ramsay will either ask for a volunteer or name a chef on the other team to switch over to balance the teams. Either way, each episode ends with Chef Ramsay's reason for his choice of elimination, concluding with him going back upstairs to his office and forcefully hanging the exiting chef's jacket on a hook that pokes a hole in the jacket; this also causes a photo of that chef to go up in flames to symbolize their elimination.
When the number of chefs is down to five or six, Ramsay will merge the teams into a single Black team, at which point the competition becomes individual. Both challenges and dinner services still take place, but with individual winners. During this period, the remaining kitchen staff will gain the help of Ramsay's sous chefs to expedite meals. Typically, one service will feature the opportunity for each chef to run the pass (taking over for Ramsay) allowing Ramsay to see how well they run the kitchen. Ramsay's sous chefs will purposely introduce quality control problems (e.g., substituting crab meat for lobster in a risotto) as a test of the chef's quality control.

When only two chefs remain, the two are challenged to design a full menu for their dream restaurant. Earlier seasons included a focus on designing restaurant decor, but later seasons have eliminated this aspect. After designing their menus, the two chefs are given a choice of previously eliminated chefs to work alongside them as sous chefs for the upcoming service. During this service, the chefs must manage all aspects of the kitchen and their chefs to ensure a good service. After service, Ramsay evaluates comments from his sous chefs, the returning chefs, and the diners, as well as his own observations, to choose a winner. The winner is revealed by Ramsay calling both chefs to his office, having them hold the handles of two identical doors, and then instructing them to open their doors at the same time; only the winner's door is unlocked and will open.

Ramsay is often free to ignore the show's rules. In several cases, Ramsay has eliminated contestants in the middle of a service (Josh in Season 3, J and Lacey in Season 5, Louie in Season 6, and most notably Nilka in Season 7) for dismal performances. In two instances, contestants have left in the middle of dinner service after arguing with Ramsay and deciding they could no longer handle his temper (Jeff in Season 1 and Andrew in Season 7). Ramsay will often call forward chefs that were not selected for nomination and put them up for nomination if he felt that they should have been included. In three cases (Carol from Season 5, Salvatore from Season 7, and Raj from season 8), Ramsay eliminated a member of the winning team (without giving them a chance to plead why they should stay), believing this chef's performance was far worse than any member of the losing team. There have also been a handful of occurrences where Ramsay allows the eliminated chef to keep their jacket depending on how far they've progressed throughout the series. There has only been one instance where a contestant was eliminated on the spot during elimination, after arguing with Ramsay and not following his rules (Joseph in Season 6). There have also been cases where contestants have been medically evacuated from the show, and two instances where a contestant actually quit the competition for injury reasons (Vanessa in Season 4, Ji in Season 5, and Robert in Season 5).

A confessional booth reveals insights into competitors' characters
Ramsay's &quot;enfant terrible&quot; personality, impeccable credentials, and overall showmanship
