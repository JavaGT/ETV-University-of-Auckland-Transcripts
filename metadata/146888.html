JR wins the TED Prize 2011. He gives his prize (the wish to 'turn the world Inside Out') and his art back to the people, creating a global participatory art project inviting people to stand up for what they care about through the power of their own image. From Tunisia to Haiti, North Dakota to Pakistan, the film follows individuals and communities pasting their portraits in the streets.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:10:32</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Design</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-10-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:15:00</td></tr></table>
