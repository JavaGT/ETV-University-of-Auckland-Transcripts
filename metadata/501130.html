Twenty-one people, including 19 children and two adults, have been killed and multiple people injured after a shooter opened fire in a school in the Texas city of Uvalde, officials say.

Auckland police responded to seven gun incidents across the city on Tuesday evening - four of which played out in just one hour. The shootings are believed to have been carried out by members of two warring gangs and are linked to gun violence earlier in the week.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, News, Reality, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:00:00</td></tr></table>
