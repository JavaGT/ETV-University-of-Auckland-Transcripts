About series:
The 'World's Greatest Living Explorer', Sir Ranulph Fiennes, returns to scene of one of his earliest feats - his 1969 hovercraft expedition on the River Nile in this 3-part adventure documentary series. For over 50 years Sir Ranulph has lived through countless escapades and life-threatening experiences.  From summiting Everest to discovering a lost city in Oman, he&rsquo;s accomplished more than most men can ever dream of.  As the 50th anniversary of his 1969 expedition approaches he's ready for a new challenge, can he teach his famous cousin, actor Joseph Fiennes how to master the role of a lifetime? Retracing the steps of the original expedition, together they&rsquo;ll crawl through the claustrophobic confines of a newly discovered ancient Egyptian tomb in Minya, get to grips with Tachtib &ndash; a traditional fighting technique using four foot sticks and come face-to-face with deadly snakes and spiders.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Leadership, Media Studies, Social Studies, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-03-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
