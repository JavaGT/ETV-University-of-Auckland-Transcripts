About series:
It's not a bad time to own a struggling restaurant or bar when a number of shows feature experts helping to revive such businesses. But what about struggling bakeries? Can anyone help them? Yes, and that person is master sugar artist Kerry Vincent, who has unique techniques to make sweet temptations. Vincent combines her years of experience with a no-nonsense approach to pump new life into stale bakeries, putting them back on the radar in their neighborhoods. Vincent looks to improve everything from a shop's old recipes to its employee morale, as well as the building itself to make the bakery more appealing to customers. In many cases, helping the business includes mending strained relationships within the family that runs the establishment.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Food Science, Leadership, Media Studies, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOOD TV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-06-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:20:00</td></tr></table>
