Jack Cunningham was a high school basketball superstar who suddenly walked away from the game for unknown reasons. Years later, he's now stuck in a meaningless job and struggling with alcoholism -- the very thing that ruined his marriage and his hope for a better life. But Jack soon gets a shot at redemption when he becomes the basketball coach for his alma mater, a program that has fallen on hard times since his teenage glory days.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:43:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie, Comedy, Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Careers, Leadership, Media Studies, Physical Education, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Movies Premiere</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-01-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:00</td></tr></table>
