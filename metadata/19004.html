Daniel Geiges helped build a uranium enrichment plant in South Africa for Colonel Gadaffi's regime in Libya. He told Panorama's reporter Jane Corbin: &quot;I never had the slightest doubt what it was for.'&quot; Geiges was the project manager at the small engineering plant near Johannesburg called Tradefin which was commissioned by a network run by the rogue Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. Geiges's boss, Gerhard Wisser, was paid a commission of $4 million by Khan's network. It became clear to Geiges that the plans, supplied and annotated by Khan, were for a plant which could enrich uranium to the highest level which is bomb grade.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ7</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-12-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:10:00</td></tr></table>
