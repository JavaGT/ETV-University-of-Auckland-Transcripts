A twenty-seven-year-old from County Down faces some tough questions over his valuation at ten times the revenue he is forecasting, not a thing that traditionally endears an entrepreneur to an investor.

And it's all too much for one emotional entrepreneur who struggles to hold back the tears when pitching her new hairstyling concept.

Plus, a Warrington-based chip shop owner showers the Den in confetti, three friends from North London perfect the art of miming in their pitch, and the multimillionaire investors find themselves singing about vegetables.

'Dragons' Den' continues with more intrepid entrepreneurs pitching Britain's brightest ideas to the multimillionaire investors. Will any of them manage to make the Dragons part with their cash?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:05:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Business</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
