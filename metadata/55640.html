'The Chemical Education Material Study', better known as 'CHEM Study', was developed in the early 1960s at U.C. Berkeley's College of Chemistry, Lawrence Hall of Science, and Harvey Mudd College, and continued at the Lawrence Hall of Science through the 1980s. The textbook was written by Glenn T. Seaborg in the early 1960s. The ionization energy (IE) is qualitatively defined as the amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron, the valence electron, of an isolated gaseous atom to form a cation.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:21:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:00</td></tr></table>
