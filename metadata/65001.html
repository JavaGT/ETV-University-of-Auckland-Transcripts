IMPORTANT: you need one adult with a sense of scientific wonder.

The items you will need for these experiments are: a drill, duct tape, a basin, water, a spoon, a laser pen, a bowl, a clear glass bottle, incense sticks, disinfectant and a lighter.
 
Experiment 1
1. Drill a hole into an empty 2 litre bottle (about 15 cm from the bottom.)
2. Cover the hole up with duct tape
3. Fill the bottle up a third of the way with water
4. Put a basin below the hole and take the tape off
5. If you shine your laser pen through the bottle you will notice that the light shine right through the water that is spilling out from the bottle
 
Experiment 2
1. Put a metal spoon into a large clear bowl that is filled with water.
2. Now look at it from a low angle and you will notice that you will see the spoon's reflection on the surface of the water
 
Experiment 3
1. Pour a small amount of water into a glass bottle/jar
2. Add a small amount of disinfectant to 'cloud' the water
3. Light an incense stick and hold it in the neck of the bottle so that the smoke fills the rest of the bottle.
4. Put the lid back on your bottle
5. Now shine the laser pen through the glass bottle/jar from different angles to see how the light bends.
