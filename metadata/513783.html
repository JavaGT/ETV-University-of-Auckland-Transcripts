Jack Tame systematically holds Nicola Willis' feet to the fire in this interview..where he shows her numbers are &quot;fantastical&quot;, where Willis conceals and hides her modelling from media and public scrutiny, where Willis is forced to concede she only &quot;subsequently&quot; looked at Double Taxation Agreements - where a Professor of Law smashed her out of the park about breaking International Law - and where she only just found out what a VPN is this week - after having nearly two years to get these matters sorted. A TOTAL TRAINWRECK - so now TVNZ 1 News will be scrambling to hide this, the NZ Herald will move on, Stuff will look the other way and NewsHub will long for another topic.
