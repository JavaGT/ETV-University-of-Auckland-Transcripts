Somebody Swallowed Stanley is about Stanley&hellip;  a plastic bag adrift in the ocean and his adventure introduces children to the fabulous diversity of ocean life and the effects of plastic pollution. 

Some 18 billion pounds of plastic waste flows into the oceans every year from coastal regions. Scientists predict that every seabird and every turtle on this planet have plastic in their stomachs and our waste travels worldwide &ndash; even found on the North Pole.
