we look at james i and charles i, and how the power and reputation of the monarchy which was at a high when elizabeth died decreased and was challenged under the stuarts.

this series :

dr david starkey presents the second of three series of his complete 20-part history of the british monarchy, beginning in the savage maelstrom of the wars of the roses. 

the tudors eventually triumph, and carry the crown of england to its peak. 

then the house of stuart takes the throne, uniting england and scotland but eventually mishandling both countries. 

the second series culminates in the english civil war and a revolution that killed a king, but failed to extirpate royal rule in britain. 

and in 1660, the king is returned to the throne.
