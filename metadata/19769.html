There. Now that I've said everything you really need to know about the programme, the only people still reading this review are those with enough morbid curiosity to wonder just how bad it could get. Obviously the producers did not have the participation or cooperation of the band; on the bright side, I guess that means that Mick and the lads can't be blamed for this debacle. Instead, 'The Rolling Stones: Truth and Lies' relies on news reels concerning the band, plus stock footage that generally has nothing to do with The Rolling Stones.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-02-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
