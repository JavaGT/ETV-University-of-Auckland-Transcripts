The United States lost its top-tier AAA credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, hours after investors alarmed by the euro zone debt crisis forced Italy to speed up an austerity drive. In a sign of how concerned world leaders are about a slide in stocks that wiped about $US2.5 trillion off global markets this week, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations would meet in &quot;just a few days&quot; to seek a common plan of action.

Rugby World Cup dress rehearsal for Eden Park
The Bledisloe Cup showdown was a final dress rehearsal for New Zealand's biggest stadium before next month's Rugby World Cup.  More than 53,000 fans made their way through Auckland to Eden Park for the match between the All Blacks and the Wallabies. In the countdown to the 7.35pm kick-off, the streets were in lockdown, and as the fans rolled in, Rugby World Cup organisers watched closely. Rachel Dacey of the Rugby World Cup Co-ordination Group, said they would be watching how the spectators moved around the park, ensuring the direction signs were right, and checking how security and volunteers operated. The Wallabies clash drew New Zealand's biggest rugby crowd in more than half a century, which meant an unprecedented test of World Cup logistics.

Trams to return to Auckland
Trams will be back on the streets of Auckland for the first time in over 50 years, with the laying of some new track. A small section of track has been laid for a modest 1.5km loop in downtown Auckland. Colin Zeff, who has been spearheading the campaign to bring back the tram, says there is something special about riding a tram. &quot;They are so environmentally friendly and they have an attraction all of their own which is hard to define&quot;. Zeff told ONE News that the appeal of trams have been used all over the world to help revitalise rundown urban areas. Auckland Mayor Len Brown hopes that the trams can do just that for the waterfront Wynyard Quarter site, also known as Tank Farm.

No grace period for new teen drink driving ban
Police are warning teenage drivers there will be no grace period for strict new drink driving laws. From midnight, teenage drivers will not be allowed to drink alcohol at all if they are driving. 
The law is being changed because of the high number of teenagers in crashes involving alcohol. 
Hard on the heels of the driving age being raised from from 15 to 16 at the beginning of this month, it will now be against the law for drivers under the age of 20 to consume alcohol before driving.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, News, Spanish, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-08-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:59:00</td></tr></table>
