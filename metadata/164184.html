About series:
What happens if you&rsquo;re pregnant and due to have a baby in the Scottish Highlands and you live a far distance from a city hospital? Your health, and the safety of your baby, lies in the hands of some very special women &ndash; the Highland Midwives. In each episode of this series, we follow three stories of midwives and mums as they prepare to give birth in some of the most beautiful &ndash; if challenging &ndash; parts of Scotland. As the birth date nears we follow the dramas, joy and occasional emergencies as mum and midwife prepare to welcome the next generation of Highlanders into the World.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Health, Media Studies, Science, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-06-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
