When Sheriff August Corbin is killed by the infamous Headless Horseman, Ichabod forms an unlikely bond with Lieutenant Abbie Mills, a young cop who has her own childhood supernatural experiences. Together, the two embark on a mission to stop evil and uncover mysteries dating back to the founding of America. Captain Frank Irving hesitates to believe Ichabod&rsquo;s tales of supernatural evils, but when clues about impending evils from Ichabod&rsquo;s former wife Katrina begin to surface, they all begin to realise that this town is anything but sleepy.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-08-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
