on the thin blue line episode :

professor brian cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system.

brian reveals how something as flimsy as an envelope of gas - an atmosphere - can create some of the most wondrous sights in the solar system. he takes a ride in an english electric lightning and flies 18 km up to the top of earth's atmosphere, where he sees the darkness of space above and the thin blue line of our atmosphere below. in the namib desert in south-west africa, he tells the story of mercury. this tiny planet was stripped naked of its early atmosphere and is fully exposed to the ferocity of space.

against the stunning backdrop of the glaciers of alaska, brian reveals his fourth wonder: saturn's moon titan, shrouded by a murky, thick atmosphere. he reveals that below the clouds lies a magical world. titan is the only place beyond earth where we've found liquid pooling on the surface in vast lakes, as big as the caspian sea, but the lakes of titan are filled with a mysterious liquid, and are quite unlike anything on earth.

notes from www.tvnz7.co.nz on this series:

for millennia mankind has been fascinated by the stars. travel deep into space with this five-part series, and see the many wonders beyond our planet with your own eyes. prepare to immerse yourself in an alien world as if you were standing there yourself. 

giant ice fountains rising over 100km high, an ocean hidden beneath a frozen crust of ice, storms three times the size of earth coloured blood red by a vortex of dust and gases, and immense volcanoes that would put mount everest in the shade - this series reveals the true and awesome beauty of our solar system. 

alongside these startlingly authentic images, some of the most spectacular, extreme locations on earth help to reveal wonders never thought possible. 

over five episodes, the series explores how these previously unseen phenomena have dramatically expanded our horizons, revealing more about the planets, their moons and how they came to be the way they are. 

the series also looks at the big picture - how the forces of nature carved out beauty and order from the chaos of space, how our home planet doesn't sit in magnificent isolation but is intimately connected with the rest of the solar system, and how these connections have created the haven we call earth.
