A key automation feature of the new DC was the deployment of the Dematic Multishuttle&reg; Goods-to-Person (GTP) system to help drive operational efficiencies and reduce the overall size and power requirements of its warehouse. 

AS Colour was the first company to install the Dematic Multishuttle GTP system in the New Zealand market.
