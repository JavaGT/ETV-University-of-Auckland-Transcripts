A villain calling himself the Game Master tricks He-Man and Battle Cat into meeting him and his warriors in the Evergreen Forest. After a very brief battle the Game Master explains that he wants He-Man to be one of his many warriors, but He-Man declines his offer. The Game Master leaves, but not before sending his spy to follow He-Man.
