But there are also small-scale developers working in the indie game realm, creating unique and experimental video games without the budgets of the larger &quot;AAA&quot; games. These indie game developers devote time, money, and take great risks in a quest to realize their creative vision. They deftly balance game mechanics &amp; systems, sound &amp; visuals, and an immersive storytelling experience to push the gaming medium into revolutionary new territory. Much like indie music or indie film, the indie gaming movement provides a creative outlet for game designers who want to work outside of the mainstream.
