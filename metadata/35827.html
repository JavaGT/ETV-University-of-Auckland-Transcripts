Rachel Hunter has made a guest appearance; Marj Neilson (Elizabeth McCrae) talked to Paul Holmes about her husband's disappearance; and even Jonah Lomu and Helen Clark had a cameo. &lt;br&gt;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:34:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ HEARTLAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-10-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>07:58:00</td></tr></table>
