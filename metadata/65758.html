An investigation into fish dumping
At the beginning of the year, many thousands of snapper washed up on beaches in Coromandel.
They were almost certainly dumped.
Last year, a Korean fishing boat operating in our water, was heavily fined for dumping roughly 400 tonnes of fish.
And that's nothing.
Fish dumping is such a major problem it's a national disgrace.
Tonight, an investigation into fish dumping.

Bake sale deemed commercial operation, shut down
Baking bad - the young people in this story have been baking up a storm - muffins, scones, coconut ice - and selling it at the local mall.
That was until they became the subject of a bureaucratic investigation and the powers that be at Auckland Council classified their after-school bake sale as a commercial operation.
That meant the children have been forced to hang up their whisks until they've completed food hygiene training and have a registered kitchen.
That seemed like overkill to everyone Campbell Live spoke to.
Rebecca Wright has the story.

Team NZ technical director talks wins
As we watch Dean Barker, with his inscrutably calm response to both victory and defeat, and as we watch the intense physicality and concentration of the Emirates Team New Zealand crew, it's possible to forget that all of their efforts would be in vain if the boat they were on was no good.
But the boat they're on is very good, seemingly faster than Oracle up wind.
The team's technical director, the man in charge of the in house design crew, is Nick Holroyd.
John Campbell spoke to him from the San Francisco waterfront this afternoon, and began by asking him how he and the team were feeling after four races, three of them won by them.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:31:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-09-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
