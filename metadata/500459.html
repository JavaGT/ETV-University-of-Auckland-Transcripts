This session reports on the initial stages of a three year empirical study of a new secondary school in New Zealand. The school is taking an &lsquo;innovative&rsquo; approach to curriculum design and pedagogy reflecting the Ministry of Education's preferences for 21st century learning: the school is leading educational change through developing a student-centered school and building teacher capacity for this new approach to schooling. The initial findings of the study will be shared and then considered within a framework informed by three models of curriculum conception. There appears to be little critique of much of the 21st Century literature which is mostly aspirational rather than evidence-based and this sessions hopes to stimulate some &lsquo;disobedient discussion&rsquo; about both the possible positives and the possible unintended consequences of the 21st approach as it emerges in one particular school.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:22:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-08-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:28:24</td></tr></table>
