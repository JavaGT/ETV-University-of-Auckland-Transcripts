If you feel it&rsquo;s well-trodden ground, you may be surprised by some of the archive clips up the programme&rsquo;s sleeve. 

There are sweet stills of &ldquo;Big Lucy&rdquo; as a boy and of his teenage period as a would-be footballer in Modena, plus some great early video from Italian television in the 1960s, though sadly, no clips remain of his introduction to British viewers on Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Among the talking heads singing his praises are critic Rupert Christiansen and Classic FM broadcaster Rob Cowan, who describes his voice as &ldquo;molten gold, pure beauty&rdquo;.
