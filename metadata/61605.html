article from:the press march 16, 2004 

each year, 25,000 university students descend on the sedate southern city of dunedin, transforming it into a crowded, raucous nesting site unlike any other in the country. 

this week's dnz documentary, a flock of students, follows the lives of some of those otago university students. 

writer-producer colin hogg decided to take a look at student life in the deep south, making the programme in the style of a wildlife documentary and viewing student life in terms of nesting, feeding, mating and display.
