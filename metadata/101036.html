In Season 6, Glee is going back to its roots for its final 13 episodes, however, the show&rsquo;s writers are introducing a quintet of new kids to pick up the New Directions banner (and bring a little teenage angst to the proceedings).

Glee is a musical comedy-drama about the misfits who make up a high-school glee club and teacher Will Schuester, the one-time glee-club star who leads them and must constantly protect &quot;glee&quot; from the malevolent schemes of diabolical cheerleader coach Sue Sylvester. A &quot;High School Musical&quot; with bite created by Ryan Murphy (&quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;), &quot;Glee&quot; was one of the breakout hits of Fall 2009.
