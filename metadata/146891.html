About series:
This miniseries tells the story of the FBI's hunt for the Unabomber in the 1990s. Agent Jim &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerld, a fresh-faced criminal profiler with the agency, faces an uphill battle in tracking the infamous criminal but also has to fight against the bureaucracy of the Unabom Task Force (UTF), of which he is a part. Although Fitz pioneers the use of forensic linguistics, others in the UTF dismiss his maverick ideas and new approaches. Ultimately, though, his new techniques help him identify and capture the Unabomber.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:24:08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-10-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
