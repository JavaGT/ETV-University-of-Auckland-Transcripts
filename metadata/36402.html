The haka and the fine handed to the French by the IRB - what do you think?
Should the French be fined for crossing the 10m line in response to the haka? The French resistance to the haka seems to have struck a chord with New Zealanders. The IRB has not revealed yet how much the French will be fined, but it's somewhere between $5000 and $20,000. That seems absurd, to us - absurd, outrageous and ridiculous. So, as form of protest, we took buckets to the Viaduct to start raising money.

IRB 'unqualified' to speak on haka matters, say All Black greats
The haka is a call to war, and the performers of it must be ready to handle the consequences of their challenge. On Sunday night it the French lined up in the shape of a v for victory - and the crowds loved it. But today the IRB has fined the French team $20,000 for its response to the haka. French supporters are puzzled, and All Black greats say the IRB is out of line. Very rarely you challenge the haka, and it's great the French did that. We respect that, they're great players.
