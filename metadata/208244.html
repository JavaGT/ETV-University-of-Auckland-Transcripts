In this four-part travelogue series Robson Green explores Australia's remote lands and meets the people that live there. On his journey, the presenter visits the communities that have adapted to life in Australia's vast outback and encounters the country's wild and sometimes deadly species. Green travels over difficult terrain, climbing mountains, sailing the surrounding seas, sampling local delicacies and facing poisonous snakes as well as a herd of wild camels. Along the way, Green discovers how people live off the land in the Daintree Rainforest, and learns about the work of the opal miners in Coober Pedy and the Barramundi farmers of Cone Bay.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Geography, Media Studies, Social Studies, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-07-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
