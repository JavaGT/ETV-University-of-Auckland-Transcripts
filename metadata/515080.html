SPONSORED BY LG. Drew Barrymore joins Danny Seo in the kitchen to whip up a delectable dish that's perfect to cozy up with this fall.
Key ingredients to this massaged brussels sprouts and creamed corn sheet pan tart recipe are the LG appliances. Named America's most reliable line of home appliances, according to a leading consumer testing organization (2023), the LG cooktop utilizes the SmoothTouch glass panel for easy control. Meanwhile, the LG counter depth MAX refrigerator not only keeps all the recipe ingredients fresh and cool, but it also boasts the industry's largest capacity in a sleek French door design, making it easy to store everything needed for your next family get-together. Last but certainly not least, the LG oven allows for Drew and Danny to check on the status of their dish without having to risk harm to their dish - by releasing hot air. They simply knock twice to see if their dish is ready, and can see that it is - without even having to open the oven door!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:54:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Interview, Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Careers, Design, Drama, Health, Media Studies, Music, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-10-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:40:00</td></tr></table>
