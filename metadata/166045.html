Matter is made of particles.
It exists in three states, namely solid, liquid and gas.
The different states of matter are due to the different arrangement of particles of matter.
In solid state, the particles of matter are very close to each other.
So the particles hold each other very tightly, that is, there is a strong force of attraction between them.
As a result, solids have a definite shape and volume.
In liquid state, the particles are packed closely together, but they are much farther apart than the particles in solids and so the force of attraction is weaker than it is in solids.
Therefore, liquids have a definite volume, but they do not have a definite shape.
They take up the shape of the container in which they are kept.
In gases, the particles of matter are very far away from each other and so the force of attraction between them is very weak.
Thus, gases have neither a definite shape nor volume.
They can fill the entire space or volume of a container irrespective of the container size.
