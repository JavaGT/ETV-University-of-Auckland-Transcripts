When a brutal vigilante homicide is made public, it sends Portland&rsquo;s Wesen community into a frenzy. As Nick investigates further, he discovers a pattern similar to that of a particularly brutal line of past Grimms. Is there another Grimm in town, or is Nick dealing with a sadistic copycat? Meanwhile, Captain Renard takes it upon himself to offer Juliette comfort in handling her ongoing dilemma with Nick.
