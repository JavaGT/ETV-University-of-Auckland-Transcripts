How many of these people are really who they say they are? Are they on holidays or do they have more sinister intentions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hosted by Grant Bowler, Border Security takes viewers behind-the-scenes of Australia's immigration, customs and quarantine departments.&lt;br&gt;The men and women that patrol here are literally at the front line when it comes to protecting our country from drug runners, illegal immigrants and potential terrorists.  They are also the last line of defence against harmful pests and disease coming into the country.  &lt;br&gt;Fly-on-the-wall footage captures the planning and implementation of large scale operations such as major drug and weapons busts, as well as the discovery of strange and bizarre objects people try to smuggle into the country. &lt;br&gt;In these uncertain times, Border Security will take viewers to the frontline of Australia's national security.&lt;br&gt;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Criminology, Law, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-01-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
