About series:
Based on the New York Times best-selling book by internationally acclaimed journalist Martha Raddatz, The Long Road Home tells the story of &ldquo;Black Sunday,&rdquo; when a small platoon of soldiers from the US 1st Cavalry Division was ferociously ambushed in Sadr City, Baghdad, in April 2004. Eight soldiers would make the ultimate sacrifice that day and more than 65 would be seriously wounded.

No soldier fights alone. The soldiers in this story are no exception. The scripted series offers viewers an intimate window into the experience of war as seen through the eyes and the hearts of the soldiers themselves and their families back home. It is an adrenaline-fuelled and emotional journey that follows the action of the battle on two simultaneous fronts &mdash; the chaotic, terror-filled streets of Sadr City, where a group of inexperienced young soldiers faces an unexpected and unimaginable attack with bravery they never knew they had, and the homefront at Fort Hood in Texas, where family members, desperate for news of their loved ones and fearing the worst, discover their own courage and determination as well.

With unprecedented intimacy, the eight-part series tells the stories not only of these courageous soldiers but also of their compatriots involved in the three desperate and deadly rescue missions launched to save them. Across eight hours, reflecting the exact amount of time the soldiers were pinned down, each episode highlights a different character&rsquo;s unique and compelling journey as we come to understand their heroism and humanity.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-11-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
