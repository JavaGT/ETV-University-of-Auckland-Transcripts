DNA tests on charred remains found in 1996 lead the team to Home Office fingerprint analyst Anna King, who was brought to the UK from Albania as a child by her brother, David Celaj. Anna was adopted by a British couple, while David went to work as a police interpreter. His last assignment was to translate for a witness in a murder case against a notorious Albanian criminal.

'New Tricks' is a British comedy-drama that follows the work of the fictional Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad (UCOS) of the Metropolitan Police Service. Originally led by Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman, it is made up of retired police officers who have been recruited to reinvestigate unsolved crimes. The series title is taken from the proverb &quot;You can't teach an old dog new tricks&quot;.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:51:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-02-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:05:00</td></tr></table>
