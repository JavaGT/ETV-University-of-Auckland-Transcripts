To show how the cameras have taken over from traditional policing, Caught on Camera has access to 20 different police forces and CCTV control rooms across Britain. Wallis goes out with the police on to the city streets and finds out how the CCTV operators and police combine their skills to catch criminals, hooligans, and drunks around the clock.
Victims of crime, have-a-go heroes and detectives also explain how the cameras have helped to resolve their own particular cases. This episode focuses on two of the most common areas of crime caught on camera &ndash; drunkenness and violence. In Huntingdon, CCTV recently recorded alcohol-related violence each weekend as the sleepy town turned into something resembling the Wild West.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:50</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Media Studies, Political Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-06-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
