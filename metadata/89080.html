A problem causes the Doctor, Rose, and Mickey to reach a parallel universe, in which most of the people of London wear EarPods that feeds information directly into the wearer's brain and Rose's father Pete (Shaun Dingwall) is still alive. The EarPods are designed by John Lumic (Roger Lloyd-Pack), who is trying to give them an &quot;upgrade&quot; which will ultimately turn the humans into Cybermen. Though he has not received permission to do this, he has been abducting and converting numerous homeless people. Mickey is mistaken for his parallel universe self Ricky and is taken by Jake Simmonds (Andrew Hayden-Smith), a member of a gang called the &quot;Preachers&quot; who are aware of the dangers of the EarPods. Cybermen begin attacking at the parallel universe Jackie's birthday party, at which the Doctor and Rose are posing as waiters. They, along with Pete, escape and run into Mickey and the Preachers, but the Cybermen close in on them.

'Doctor Who' is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC from 1963 to the present day. The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord - a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-09-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:00:00</td></tr></table>
