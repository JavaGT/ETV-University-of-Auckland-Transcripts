Or any colour, for that matter?
It's a question that you'd think kids have been asking for thousands of years, but it might not be that old at all. The ancient Greek poet Homer never used a word for blue in The Odyssey or The Iliad, because blue is one of the last colours that cultures pick out a word for. In this episode, I'll tell you not only why the sky is blue, but why it's red at sunset. It turns out, those colours are all part of the same sunbeam. And when you're looking at a blue sky, you could be sharing a special moment with someone thousands of miles away. Next time a child (or the child inside you) wants to know why the sky is blue, you'll have science to back you up.
(We know that the Earth turns the wrong direction in the animation, sorry about that. Something weird happened when we were programming the animation and it was reversed.)
