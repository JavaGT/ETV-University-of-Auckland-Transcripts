Jane almost drowns while investigating the murder of a fireman and loses his memory, turning him into the old con man Patrick Jane.

The Mentalist follows Patrick Jane, an independent consultant for the fictional California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. Although not an officer of the law, he uses skills from his former career as a successful yet admittedly fraudulent psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents solve various crimes. The ultimate goal of Patrick Jane in his cooperation with the CBI is to track down the killer known as &quot;Red John,&quot; who was responsible for the brutal murders of Jane's wife and daughter.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:57:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-04-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:40:00</td></tr></table>
