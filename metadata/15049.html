Captured on film and video by various visitors over the seven days, 'Give Peace a Song' documents the events that took place in the infamous suite, 1742. Highlights include the visits made by Tom Smothers, Derek Taylor, Petula Clark, Timothy Leary, activist Dick Gregory, and cartoonist Al Capp. On June 1st, the last day of the bed-in, Lennon posted lyrics on the suite's walls for a spontaneous group recording by all those there, to sing to the world 'Give Peace a Chance', which quickly became a universal anthem for peace.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History, Music, Philosophy, Political Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:30:00</td></tr></table>
