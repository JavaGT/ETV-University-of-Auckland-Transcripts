on dead or alive episode :

this fourth episode looks at the size of planets, volcanoes, and the jovian moon io.

in this episode we travel to the tallest mountain on earth, the volcano mauna kea on hawaii, to show how something as basic as a planet's size can make the difference between life and death. 

yet, even the summit of this volcano would stand in the shade of the tallest mountain in the solar system, an extinct volcano on mars called olympus mons, which rises up 27kms. 

however, the fifth wonder in the series isn't on a planet at all. it's on a tiny moon of jupiter.

notes from www.tvnz7.co.nz  on this series :

for millennia mankind has been fascinated by the stars. 
travel deep into space with this five-part series, and see the many wonders beyond our planet with your own eyes. 
prepare to immerse yourself in an alien world as if you were standing there yourself. 

giant ice fountains rising over 100km high, an ocean hidden beneath a frozen crust of ice, storms three times the size of earth coloured blood red by a vortex of dust and gases, and immense volcanoes that would put mount everest in the shade - this series reveals the true and awesome beauty of our solar system. 

alongside these startlingly authentic images, some of the most spectacular, extreme locations on earth help to reveal wonders never thought possible. 

over five episodes, the series explores how these previously unseen phenomena have dramatically expanded our horizons, revealing more about the planets, their moons and how they came to be the way they are. 

the series also looks at the big picture - how the forces of nature carved out beauty and order from the chaos of space, how our home planet doesn't sit in magnificent isolation but is intimately connected with the rest of the solar system, and how these connections have created the haven we call earth.
