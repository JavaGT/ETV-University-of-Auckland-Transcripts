The larger portion of our population can take for granted that when they are ill some of the finest treatments in the world are immediately available. Yet for many others their access is restricted or prohibited. This program provides three case studies of Australian organisations: Sacred Heart Mission, Bendigo Community Health Services and Inner South Community Health Services, who have all developed innovative programs to help minimise the impacts of health inequalities.
