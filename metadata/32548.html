Illegal fishing and poaching is still a major problem throughout New Zealand. Highly organized poaching rings with criminal networks stretching into Asia and the Pacific are targeting paua and other shellfish. As well as large scale poaching there is the relentless tide of reckless or carefree shell food gatherers and recreational fishermen who often exceed their daily limit. In 2008 the Ministry Of Fisheries carried out over 27%2C000 inspections, resulting in millions of dollars of boats, vehicles and other fishing equipment being seized as a result of illegal activity.%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3EThe Maritime Police and Coastguard are constantly on the alert around our coastline for sailors caught off guard by changeable weather and freak storms to pleasure craft being ransacked in the deep of the night. As always on Coastwatch, the stakes are high and the incidents fraught with danger, confrontation and excitement.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:33:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-06-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:59:00</td></tr></table>
