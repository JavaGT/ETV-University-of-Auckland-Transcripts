Gus explores New Zealand&rsquo;s three National Parks on the West Coast of the South Island, a lush wilderness that ranges from low-lying wetlands to dramatic glaciers and limestone geology.

'Wild About New Zealand' explores the dynamic beauty New Zealand's National Parks through the eyes of environmental specialist and adventure guide, Gus Roxburgh. From the heights of Mt Cook to the misty &quot;shadowlands&quot; of Fiordland and the spectacular Hauraki Marine Park, Gus ventures into New Zealand's extraordinary wilderness to make the most of our backyard. Twenty-three million years after our landscape emerged from the ocean depths, it's still as diverse as it is unique. Our National Parks are home to remote corners of the country seldom seen, still isolated and rugged, and where unique plants and animals found nowhere else on earth flourish. Explore the stunning beauty of some of our most precious places from the comfort of the couch with a host who is passionate about preserving our country and its natural inhabitants.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Geography, Natural History, New Zealand, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-10-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
