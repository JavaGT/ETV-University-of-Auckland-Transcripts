In this insightful program we take a holistic approach to understanding and responding to loss and grief. We speak frankly with Christine McMahon, who lost her only son in Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires in 2009, about her personal experience of extreme loss and grief. Experts in counselling and palliative care help us to recognise loss and grief and employ practical strategies to support a person who is battling through one the most difficult times in their life.
