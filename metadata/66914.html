Returning with his family, golden boy Ben has controversially inherited the local pub from his recently deceased father. Produced by South Pacific Pictures, the one hour popular drama screened for two seasons. Writer James Griffin and director Niki Caro worked on the show, alongside much of the talent who would later create Mercy Peak and Outrageous Fortune.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:38</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ HEARTLAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-10-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:00:00</td></tr></table>
