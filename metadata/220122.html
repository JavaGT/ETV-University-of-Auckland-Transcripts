Giacomo Puccini wrote what was supposed to be his last opera at a time where, riddled with disease and old age as he was, he felt like his own turmoil was reflected in the outside world: itself staggering, unsteady, overwhelmed and smashed by the chaos of European diplomacy. In spite of these obstacles, he persevered and worked until the very end of his life on this opera that he left unfinished but that proved to be a &ldquo;way out&rdquo; for him in many ways. Drawn from an ancient Persian epic from the 13th century, Turandot was indeed an excuse to escape into a new dramatic universe, one made of unexpected sounds and symbols. Here, in a world removed both geographically and chronologically from his own reality, he gave into the seductive powers of exoticism and eroticism, just as his own heroin Princess Turandot abandons herself to the mysteries of love and forgiveness.

After twenty years of absence, Puccini&rsquo;s Turandot was revived on the stage of the Teatro Real in a new production by American stage director Robert Wilson. One of the most important theatre and visual artist of our times, the director who gave life to Philip Glass&rsquo;s Einstein of the Beach and who reinvented Debussy&rsquo;s Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande hadn&rsquo;t worked on a Puccini opera in twenty-five years, since his ground-breaking Madama Butterfly commissioned by the Paris Opera in 1993. This new encounter between his powerful visual universe and Puccini&rsquo;s evocative music was bound to be an outstanding event. Carried out by a brilliant cast of singers, dominated by Irene Theorin as Turandot, Gregory Kunde as Calaf and Yolanda Auyanet as Li&ugrave;, this magnificent production is conducted by the Teatro Real&rsquo;s associate musical director Nicola Luisotti &ndash; and has been met with universal acclaim.

ACT I
Peking, in the mythic past. Outside the Imperial Palace, a mandarin reads an edict to the crowd: Any prince seeking to marry Princess Turandot must answer three riddles. If he fails, he will die. The most recent suitor, the Prince of Persia, is to be executed at the moon&rsquo;s rising. Among the onlookers are the slave girl Li&ugrave;, her aged master, and the young Cal&agrave;f, who recognizes the old man as his long-lost father, Timur, vanquished King of Tartary. Only Li&ugrave; has remained faithful to him, and when Cal&agrave;f asks her why, she replies that once, long ago, Cal&agrave;f smiled at her. The mob cries for blood but greets the rising moon with a sudden fearful silence. As the Prince of Persia goes to his death, the crowd calls upon the princess to spare him. Turandot appears in her palace and wordlessly orders the execution to proceed. Transfixed by the beauty of the unattainable princess, Cal&agrave;f decides to win her, to the horror of Li&ugrave; and Timur. The three ministers of state, Ping, Pang, and Pong, appear and also try to discourage him, but Cal&agrave;f is unmoved. He reassures Li&ugrave;, then strikes the gong that announces a new suitor. 


ACT II
Within their private apartments, Ping, Pang, and Pong lament Turandot&rsquo;s bloody reign, hoping that love will conquer her and restore peace. Their thoughts wander to their peaceful country homes, but the noise of the crowd gathering to witness the riddle challenge calls them back to reality.

In the royal throne room, the old emperor asks Cal&agrave;f to reconsider, but the young man will not be dissuaded. Turandot arrives. She recounts the story of her beautiful ancestor, Princess Lou-Ling, who was abducted and killed by a conquering prince. In revenge, Turandot has turned against men and determined that none shall ever possess her. Trumpets then herald the beginning of the riddles. Turandot poses her first question to Cal&agrave;f: What is born each night and dies each dawn? &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; Cal&agrave;f answers correctly. Turandot continues: What flickers red and warm like a flame, yet is not a flame? &ldquo;Blood,&rdquo; Cal&agrave;f replies after a moment&rsquo;s thought. Shaken, Turandot delivers the third riddle: What is like ice but burns, and if it accepts you as a slave, makes you a king? Tense silence prevails until Cal&agrave;f triumphantly cries &ldquo;Turandot!&rdquo; The crowd erupts in joy, and the princess vainly begs her father not to give her to the stranger. Hoping to win her love, Cal&agrave;f offers Turandot a challenge of his own: If she can learn his name by dawn, he will forfeit his life.


ACT III
At night in the Imperial Gardens, Cal&agrave;f hears a proclamation: On pain of death, no one in Peking shall sleep until Turandot learns the stranger&rsquo;s name. Cal&agrave;f is certain of his victory, but Ping, Pang, and Pong try to bribe him to leave the city. As the fearful mob threatens him to learn his name, soldiers drag in Li&ugrave; and Timur. Cal&agrave;f tries to convince the crowd that neither of them knows his secret. When Turandot appears, commanding Timur to speak, Li&ugrave; replies that she alone knows the stranger&rsquo;s identity and will never reveal it. Soldiers torture her, but she remains silent. Impressed by her fortitude, Turandot asks what gives Li&ugrave; the strength to resist. It is love, she replies. When the torture intensifies, Li&ugrave; tells Turandot that she, too, will know the joys of love. Then she snatches a dagger and kills herself. The crowd forms a funeral procession, and Timur follows as they take away her body. Turandot remains alone to confront Cal&agrave;f, who impetuously kisses her. Knowing emotion for the first time, Turandot weeps. Cal&agrave;f, now sure of winning her, reveals his identity.

Once again before the emperor&rsquo;s throne, Turandot declares she knows the stranger&rsquo;s name: It is Love.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:02:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Asian Studies, Careers, Chinese, Classical Studies, Drama, History, Italian, Languages, Literature</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-11-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:00:00</td></tr></table>
