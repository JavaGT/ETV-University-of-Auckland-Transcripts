They are the subject of gossip and scandal which also, erroneously, involves Christopher, who is wounded and shell-shocked in a French hospital. Sylvia entertains yet another admirer, her husband's banker Brownlie but defends Christopher against his malicious gossip. Christopher returns home but Sylvia's erstwhile German sympathies and past indiscretions, plus the effect of Brownlie's invidious actions as he refuses to accept Christopher's cheques, does not make them the most popular of society couples. Nevertheless they attend a soir&eacute;e at the MacMasters, where Christopher re-encounters Valentine, now working as a teacher. Aware that he is also supposed to have taken Valentine as a mistress Christopher decides that he may as well put it to the test and visits her but they are thwarted when Edward, her brother, returns home on leave from the Navy. As Christopher goes back to the war in France Valentine tells him that she will wait for him.

'Parade's End' is a five-part BBC/HBO/VRT television serial, which is an adaptation of the tetralogy of novels of the same name by Ford Madox Ford. A love triangle develops between the old-fashioned Christopher Tietjens, his vindictive wife Sylvia and young suffragette Valentine Wannop, in the midst of World War I and a Europe on the brink of profound change. As the war drags on, Christopher goes to fight in France, and leaves behind Sylvia, a son who may or may not be his, and Valentine. He must ultimately decide whom he is to remain with for the duration of his life: the beautiful yet manipulative Sylvia or the adoring Valentine.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, History, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
