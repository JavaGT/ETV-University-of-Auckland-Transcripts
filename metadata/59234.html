They are composed of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium. Bones generally hold 99% of the body's calcium. Osteoporosis or porous bone is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, which leads to bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine and wrist. Two essential cells are involved in the daily turnover of the bone -- osteoblast cells and steoclast cells. Over activity of the osteoclast cells leads to osteoporosis. 

There are two types of osteoporosis -- Primary Osteoporosis and Secondary Osteoporosis. Primary Osteoporosis is in turn divided into Type I and Type II. Symptoms of osteoporosis are: swelling and joint pain, fracture, disfigurement and debilitation, and kyphosis. 

Osteoporosis can be treated by changes in lifestyle, like quitting smoking, regular exercise, a balanced diet, and by taking medication such as Estrogen Replacement Therapy, Biphosponates (Atendronate and Risedronate) or Synthetic Calcitonin, or by Parathyroid Hormone supplements.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:01:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Chemistry, Health, Learning Support, Physical Education, Science, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-07-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:01:00</td></tr></table>
