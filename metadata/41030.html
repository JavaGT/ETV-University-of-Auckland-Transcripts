With trademark fierceness she drops in on Bjurman (Peter Andersson), the legal guardian who abused her. She threatens him with his own gun. Soon afterward, a young journalist and his girlfriend (Hans Christian Thulin and Jennie Silfverhjelm) show up dead, their heads plugged with bullets from that very firearm. Then Bjurman gets whacked. Guess who's a suspect for triple murder? At its simplest, Fire tells of Mikael's efforts to exonerate Lisbeth. At its most baroque, it explores a vast web of sex trafficking and deep-rooted conspiracy that goes back decades and touches on Lisbeth's inflammatory background.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:04:27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-03-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:20:00</td></tr></table>
