This was the first A and P show in the area for five years. 03.10 NZEF Xmas in Italy: Christmas mail is unloaded from trucks in Italy as the snow falls. Patriotic parcels are loaded onto trucks for frontline troops. Men chase chickens round a haystick and negotiate with the farmer for the cost of their Christmas dinner. A huge pig is destined for the Maori Battalion. The men butcher and dress some pigs, turkeys and chickens. Bringing home the wine is a responsible job! Men open their mail - one gets a tin of corned beef and one gets a bra - obviously the wrong parcel. The men drop the wine! At the frontline the men are overhauling machine guns and firing from fixed positions. At Divisional HQ, General Sir Bernard Fergusson arrives for Christmas dinner and sees the traditional ceremony of the officers serving the men. The padre hands out two bottles of cheer per man. But even though it's Christmas, there's no forgetting the war and ambulances arrive bringing wounded men from the frontline. To cap off the day, there's an all-Khaki double wedding and, at an isolated outpost, a group of men sing White Christmas in the snow.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:07:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
