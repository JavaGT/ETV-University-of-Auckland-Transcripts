Rick and Marty Lagina make one of the biggest discoveries in the 200-year old search for treasure on Oak Island.

&lsquo;The Curse of Oak Island&rsquo; follows brothers Marty and Rick Lagina originally from Kingsford, Michigan through their effort to find the speculated - and as of yet undiscovered - buried treasure believed to have been concealed through extraordinary means on Oak Island. The brothers became fascinated with the island after reading the January, 1965 issue of Reader's Digest magazine which featured an article on the Restall family's work to solve the mystery of the so-called &quot;Money Pit.&quot; The series also discusses the history of the island, discoveries, and the sometimes fatal attempts to solve the mystery which has endured for hundreds of years.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:50:40</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Ecology & Environment, Economics, Geography, History, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-06-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
