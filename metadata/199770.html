Fred Flarsky is a gifted and free-spirited journalist who has a knack for getting into trouble. Charlotte Field is one of the most influential women in the world -- a smart, sophisticated and accomplished politician. When Fred unexpectedly runs into Charlotte, he soon realizes that she was his former baby sitter and childhood crush. When Charlotte decides to make a run for the presidency, she impulsively hires Fred as her speechwriter -- much to the dismay of her trusted advisers.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:59:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie, Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Careers, Media Studies, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Movies Premiere</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-12-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:09:00</td></tr></table>
