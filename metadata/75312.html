Hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson it's time to set sail for the stars in a reboot of Carl Sagan's legendary series.

Famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson takes a tour of the Solar System and the known universe establishing the components of Earth's &quot;address&quot; within the Virgo Supercluster. He then shares the story of the person who championed an expansive understanding of Earth's place in the universe by presenting Renaissance Italian Giordano Bruno's vision of the universe as a limitless expanse of space and time. He then makes an exploration into the Cosmic Calendar, which dates back to the dawn of the Big Bang (similar to the presentation from episode 1 of the original series). The episode ends with deGrasse Tyson narrating how he met his mentor Carl Sagan, who hosted the first Cosmos series.

The episode included a brief introduction recorded by United States President Barack Obama to describe the &quot;spirit of discovery&quot; that the series aspires to give to its viewers.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Animation, Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Astronomy, Chemistry, Geography, Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-03-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
