There is only one way for Chester to do things&mdash;his own way. &quot;You definitely have a mind of your own,&quot; said Chester's mother. &quot;That's one way to put it,&quot; said Chester's father. Luckily Chester's best friend, Wilson, likes doing things just the same way as Chester. So all is well. That is, until Lilly moves into the neighborhood. Because Lilly, as we all know, has her own way of doing things!
