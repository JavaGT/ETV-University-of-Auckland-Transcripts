ABOUT THE SERIES:
The Call Centre follows CEO Nev Wilshire and his unorthodox approach to management. Often, the lines of what is appropriate are blurred, but the staff seem to love their work environment because of it.

Wilshire simply wants his staff to perform, which often means engaging in the social and private lives of others in order to help them come to work in a happier state.

He helps an administration assistant find a new boyfriend, organises blind dating evenings and plays a fair number of practical jokes.

Meanwhile, the staff at The Call Centre also form their own story lines throughout the show. Shot in a fly-on-the-wall style, viewers are given a window into the lives of everyone, from the tea lady to some of Nev's best sellers on the phone.

One thing is for certain, in The Call Centre, anything really does go.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>23:05:00</td></tr></table>
