Aeneas is a Trojan in exile. Their love will last only as long as their celebratory hunting party. They will tear each other apart over a recitative. And the queen will die to a sublime lament. Around this simple plot taken from Virgil&rsquo;s Aeneid, Purcell composes one of the first English operas, a dark gem that is a masterpiece of the genre. In a concentrated piece over an eventful hour, a destiny is overturned. But the director, Vincent Huguet, places this destiny in a broader context by asking Maylis de Kerangal to write a prologue describing Dido&rsquo;s wanderings before she comes to Carthage, revealing the ambiguity, the light and shade inherent in every being. Light and shade that a young cast and the musicians of the Ensemble Pygmalion, conducted for the first time by Vaclav Luks, will project on the stage of the Archeveche providing a perfect link between yesterday and today.
