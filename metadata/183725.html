Although shadowed by film and safety crews, the group are in charge of their journey, navigating the route and the difficult access in a country ill-equipped for disability.

In the 4x4 is Vicky Balch, who lost her leg after the rollercoaster accident at Alton Towers in 2015. She's determined to restore her independence, but suffers an early setback when the car's brakes fail. Mary Russell was born with achondroplasia - the most common type of dwarfism. She has struggled with depression throughout her life and still fights a battle with low self-esteem. Olympic wheelchair rugby captain Steve Brown was paralysed from the chest down 12 years ago. In Vietnam he faces his greatest challenge on an ambitious caving expedition.

On the motorbikes are Louise Halvey, who has progressive hearing loss and must negotiate the chaos of Hanoi traffic, marathon runner Charlie Lewis, who convinced a surgeon to amputate his right leg following a snowboarding accident almost ten years previously that had left him in constant pain, and Andy Slade, who is the most experienced biker. He lost his arm in an industrial accident nine years ago but soon got back to bike racing, becoming the UK's fastest one-armed man on a motorbike.
