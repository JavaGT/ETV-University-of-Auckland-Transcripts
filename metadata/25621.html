This comprehensive five part series offers an in-depth view of the Middle East in the past century, with a judiciously balanced perspective on its endless conflicts and turmoil. Commencing with the end of Ottoman rule, it depicts the stability of the Holy Land prior to World War 1. Britain simultaneously promises a homeland for the Zionists, and an independent Arab state to embrace the vast Middle East. But neither promise is fulfilled; the British expropriate the bulk of the desirable lands, including Palestine. As the Jewish percentage of the population grows, conflict escalates around Jerusalem. The arbitrary division of the rest of the Middle East and the installation of rulers seen as British puppets sets the scene for endless strife. The Holocaust created worldwide support for a Jewish state, and modern Israel was born in 1948. But its birth ironically sparked a flood of passionate Arab nationalism. Armed conflict has continued in various forms up to present times.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, History, Political Studies, Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-08-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:30:00</td></tr></table>
