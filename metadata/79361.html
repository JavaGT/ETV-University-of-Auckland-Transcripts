Prior to the First World War, women's rights were a regular item of Path&eacute; newsreels.  One great landmark in the history of Pathe scoops was one of their cameras capturing the extreme sacrifice by the suffragette Emily Davison. In the blink of an eye, Davison runs from the crowds and throws herself under the King's horse. Crowds of people run on to the track to try and help both the fallen rider and Davison. Davison died several days later in hospital.
