This sprawling, arid land plays host to the highest concentration of elephants on Earth, and they've recently lost their leader. The quest to become the new elephant king is on, and the candidates are all six-ton giants, willing to throw their weight around. Join ecologist Caitlin O'Connell as she documents the pachyderm politics and unlocks the secrets of this elephant society. From her hidden bunker, mere feet from the turbulent battle, O'Connell will decipher the meaning of their actions as the fight for the crown unfolds.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:06:37</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Science, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-07-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:15:00</td></tr></table>
