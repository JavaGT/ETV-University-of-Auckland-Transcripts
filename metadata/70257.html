Reed is a materials assurance engineer who has a background in chemistry and has most recently worked on improving Hubble's outer blanket layer.  Townsend came to Goddard with a background in physics and has served as the instrument manager of Hubble's newest imager, Wide Field Camera 3.  Through their personal backgrounds and current work, Reed and Townsend show that great engineers share patience, tenacity, and a passion for problem solving.
