The hugely popular series returns to Liverpool Women&rsquo;s Hospital to highlight the extraordinary highs and lows of the day-to-day life in a world where every minute of every hour a baby is born.  And as is discovered, no birth story is ever the same.

Health Care Assistant at the hospital Olwen has a very special delivery as she supports her grand-daughter whilst on the ward.  Midwife Sarah also keeps it in the family when she gives birth to twins naturally with her mum, who is also a midwife at the hospital, by her side.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Health, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-06-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
