But how do we actually define ICT's and what is the specific role they play in business? Experts with a lifelong understanding of digital technology guide viewers through: the ICT environment, the ICT needs and solutions for organisations, monitoring and evaluating ICT's and what the future of ICT's might look like. The program offers a variety of visual metaphors, which help to illuminate the inter-connected world of digital communication and how reliant we've become on technology. Upper secondary I.T and business audiences will find this a visually-appealing and highly-accessible program as they seek to learn more about the world of ICT's.
