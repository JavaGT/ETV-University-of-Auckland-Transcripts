About series:
Bordering four states and parts of Canada, Lake Erie is a popular Midwest destination for year-round family activities. Ominously, it's also the home to some dark and deadly crimes. This programming event brings viewers to the edge of Erie's waters to explore murder cases in the region, topped by an extensive investigation into the 1989 kidnapping and murder of 10-year-old Amy Mihaljevic. Still an active, unsolved case, Amy's story remains a source of intrigue and speculation in the region. Hourlong episodes sort through the facts of the case and painstakingly follow how each lead was exhausted and how suspects were dismissed one by one. The series continues with stories of four additional haunting murder mysteries from around the Great Lake that were solved by law enforcement.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, History, Law, Media Studies, Science, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-09-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
