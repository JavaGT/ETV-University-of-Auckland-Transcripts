In &quot;Anote's Ark&quot; - a new documentary film premiering at this year's Sundance Film Festival - Tong travels the globe to highlight the plight of his impoverished nation, whose 100,000 residents are now at risk of becoming refugees due to sea level rise.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very personal, emotional story&quot;, says the film's producer, Bob Moore. &quot;It&rsquo;s pure storytelling, telling the next major story around climate change, which is climate migration.&rdquo; Given Kiribati's location in the Pacific Ocean, the possibility that residents would have to one day flee their homes caught them off guard.

&quot;Kiribati is in the centre of the world&quot;, says Tong in the film's opening narration. &quot;So far away, so isolated - we thought we would be immune from the tribulations of this world.&quot; A World Bank report in July 2016 suggested that Australia and New Zealand allow open access migration for Pacific nations to spur economic growth and alleviate the pressure of forced mass migration.

So, are Kiribati and its people resigned to their fate, or can something be done to prevent disaster?

In this episode of The Stream, we speak with Tong and &quot;Anote's Ark&quot; director Matthieu Rytz to learn more about the Kiribati's mission to save their home and way of life.
