For your job, you have to train some colleagues in French on what you do best, but it won't be productive if you can't understand their questions. You can only hope you'll be clear in your explanations...or that your French helps you ace the Q and A session that follows. In this lesson you'll learn more French expressions and words for the French classroom. Continue your education in French, no matter what kind of education it is.
