About:
BAFTA Award-winning comedian Graham Norton hosts this long-running, eponymous talk show on which he discusses the people, trends and news stories that interest him the most. As you'd expect from a comedic talk show, Norton performs a monologue and other comedy sketches, which include eccentric stories and characters, while welcoming celebrity guests and musical performers. The hourlong program often includes madcap audience participation. The party happens in Graham's world -- and you're invited.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Music, Entertainment, Interview, Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Media Studies, Music, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-05-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
