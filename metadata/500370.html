Stonehenge Aotearoa is not a replica of the ruin on Salisbury Plain in England. It is a complete and working structure designed and built for its precise location in the Wairarapa region of New Zealand. The henge stones, viewed from the centre, mark the daily rise and set positions of the sun, moon and bright stars. The henge also forms a Polynesian star compass marking the bearings taken by Polynesian sailors to and from Aotearoa. &lt;br&gt;  Featuring Richard Hall - manager of the Aotearoa Stonehenge project. Lesley Hall - project treasurer, Kay Leather was the construction team leader and Jennifer Picking - secretary of the The Phoenix Astronomical Society.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:04:08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, New Zealand, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
