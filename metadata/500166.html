Though the 3rd. N.Z. Division was already established 150 miles to the north on Nissan Island, the Japanese cut off on Bougainville were still fighting desperately. These grim pictures were taken under fire by a N.Z. National Film Unit Cameraman. Warships bombard the coast of a tropic island, the troops swarm over the beaches, and push inland against the Japanese. The camera crew joins a Fijian patrol and fight a fierce action at close quarters in the jungle until the main force comes up and blasts the enemy pillboxes with grenades and flame throwers.
