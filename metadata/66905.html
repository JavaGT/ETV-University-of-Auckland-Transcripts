Fraser Doherty, the entrepreneur behind a successful jam-making company, goes undercover as an intern in Jane's Pantry, a chain of 10 Gloucestershire bakeries where profits are down and redundancies are looming. Fraser tries to persuade owner Neville Morse to overhaul his brand, widen its appeal and take it more upmarket

Disguised as ordinary interns, they monitor the companies from the inside &ndash; in between making cups of coffee and doing menial tasks. With the innocence of youth as cover, the interns gain the confidence of the staff and start unravelling where problems lie. After they finally reveal their true identity and credentials, they shake up the businesses with a raft of inspiring ideas.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:48:46</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Advertising/Marketing, Business, Careers, Economics</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-10-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
