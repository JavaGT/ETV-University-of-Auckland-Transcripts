About the Series:
Filmmaker Ondi Timoner embeds herself within a group of idealistic students and charismatic entrepreneurs who are committing themselves to create what they call &quot;the world's greatest sustainable modern town&quot; in a Panamanian jungle.

When we enter Jungletown, the staff are feverishly fixing water lines as 80 interns say goodbye to their families and comfortable homes to descend into the jungle of Panama and build. It's the hardest semester in Kalu Yala's history, with the most rain and interns ever putting a strain on the fragile community. The stress causes a staff member to leave on the eve of the semester, later followed by eleven interns, with one to be expelled.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VICELAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
