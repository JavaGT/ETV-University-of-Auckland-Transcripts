This documentary reveals the keys to understanding the work, by re-establishing it in its social and cultural context, and bears witness to Hopper's fierce independence as a painter well aware of the artistic stakes of his time, split between realism and abstraction.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:50:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
