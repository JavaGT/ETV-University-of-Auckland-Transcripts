The army has given Rommel's troops no rest and they are retreating towards the Tunisian border. The NZ Division presses on along the desert road littered with burnt out guns and tanks. In some places, roads must be carved out of the rock to enable the push towards Tripoli to continue. Advance units are in constant contact with the enemy, rounding up scattered remnants. Men of the Maori Battalion lead the way into Tripoli.  The Governor General of Libya surrenders to General Montgomery. This is the end of Italy's African empire.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:08:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
