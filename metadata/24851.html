This documentary centres on winemaker Almuth Lorenz, who in 1982 left the family estate in Germany's Rheinhessen wine region to start a new life in Marlborough. Grapes had been grown in Rheinhessen for centuries; but in Marlborough, there is more chance to experiment. As this episode reveals, German settlers have been arriving in Marlborough since the 1840s. We also meet other more recent German immigrants: a young family, and a man attracted to the freedom and beauty of Golden Bay.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ HEARTLAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-07-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:00:00</td></tr></table>
