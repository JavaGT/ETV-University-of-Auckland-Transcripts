Featuring interviews with people who knew her or were involved with the investigation, with revealing police interview footage and CCTV.

Grace Emmie Rose Millane (2 December 1996 &ndash; 2 December 2018) was a British tourist whose disappearance in Auckland, New Zealand, in December 2018 sparked international attention. A 26-year-old man, Jesse Shane Kempson was charged with her murder on 8 December 2018, and her body was found in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges to the west of Auckland the following day. Kempson's name was suppressed by New Zealand courts, meaning it could not be published in New Zealand; however, some international media outlets chose to publish it contrary to the New Zealand court order.

Kempson was tried at the Auckland High Court in November 2019; he claimed that she had died during consensual sex. After a three-week trial, he was convicted by a unanimous guilty verdict and later sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years. Kempson filed an appeal against his conviction, which was dismissed by New Zealand's Court of Appeal on 18 December 2020.[4] The suppression order was lifted by the New Zealand Supreme Court on 22 December 2020. It was also revealed that he had been convicted on multiple rape and abuse charges relating to two other women in October and November 2020.
