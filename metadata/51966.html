Joan Watson (Lucy Liu) is assigned as the sober companion of Sherlock Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller). When she goes to meet her new companion, she finds that he escaped from rehab the day of his release. When she meets him, he takes her on the subway to a house in Manhattan; he explains that before he began using drugs he used to work for Scotland Yard as a consultant to help solve homicides. He works on the case of a woman who was attacked, and supposedly kidnapped, only to find that she was hidden in a safe room in the apartment. The next day, Holmes finds that the killer is most likely a serial killer, finding similarities to another case, except that this victim survived. After interviewing the woman, Holmes and Watson find that she knew the man who attacked her. When Holmes calls NYPD Captain Thomas Gregson (Aidan Quinn) with his newest lead, Gregson reveals that they're at the suspect's house, and that said suspect has committed suicide. Watson and Holmes fight, due to his lack of trust and sharing regarding his past, before drugs, and mysterious personal life, resulting in her saying she'll request another companion assignment. Holmes concludes that the victim's husband, a psychiatrist plotted to have her killed by giving his patient pills that would make him violent, then sending him after his wife. There was a pre-nuptial agreement, and he would have received money if his wife were to die.
