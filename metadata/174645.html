About series:
Well into the second generation of a grand televangelist tradition, the renowned Gemstone family is living proof that worship pays dividends in all sizes, including their megachurch. Danny McBride stars as Jesse Gemstone, the eldest of three grown Gemstone offspring, who looks to lead in his father&rsquo;s footsteps, but finds his past sins jeopardizing the family ministry.

Playing Jesse&rsquo;s siblings are Adam Devine as pseudo-hipster Kelvin, the youngest of the trio and a thorn in Jesse&rsquo;s side, and Edi Patterson as Judy, who is secretly living with her fianc&eacute; and dreams of escaping the Gemstone compound. John Goodman is Eli Gemstone, the family&rsquo;s patriarch, who finds himself at a crisis point as he mourns the loss of his wife, Aimee-Leigh, and questions the Gemstones&rsquo; mission.
