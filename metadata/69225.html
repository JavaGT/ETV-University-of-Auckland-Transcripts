It's magazine-style infotainment with a target demographic of 10-16 year olds - think &quot;Rove&quot; or &quot;Ellen&quot; with a teenage twist.

In her apartment-styled studio Erin chats with some of New Zealand's biggest stars from music, TV, sports and the arts who inspire our audience to be the best they can.  

Out on the street, a team of passionate young reporters cover what matters giving viewers a VIP front row seat to the country's best events, people and places. Join All White Aaron Clapham and Kenny Lynn from the Highlanders (Sports), Shortland Street actress Kim Crossman (Entertainment), fashion guru Serena Rongonui (Fashion &amp; Events) and committed greenies Eve Marama and Nic Vallance (Environment) to get the low down.  Meanwhile London based reporter Jon Franks gets the inside scoop at the glitzy premieres and gives the show an international feel!

As well the show celebrates our young tall poppies putting teenagers onscreen to tell their own inspiring real life stories of achievement, skill and determination.

The Erin Simpson Show's also jam-packed with music, video and game reviews and competitions with must-have prizes: trips to LA, flights to Justin Bieber's Sydney concert,  backstage passes to meet Katy Perry all hotly sought-after by a dedicated  audience who love to interact with the show via Twitter and Facebook.

Several times a year the show shakes things up by leaving the studio and taking to the road. A week long special from Los Angeles in which Erin and then sports reporter Isaac showed viewers around Hollywood, Disneyland, Venice Beach and Sea World drew the show's highest ratings and demands for repeat showings. In the current season the show has filmed a week of special shows based at Shortland Street to celebrate their 20 year anniversary!

Now in its fourth successful year, the Erin Simpson Show has a 30 week on air production run - 150 episodes from February through October.
