Chefs compete for the chance to cook at a glittering Olympic banquet. The North West finalists go head to head as they prepare a lavish meal for judges Prue Leith, Matthew Fort and Oliver Peyton.

Great British Menu is back and the fight is on as some of the UK's greatest chefs battle for the chance to secure a place for their recipes on the Great British Menu.

Sourcing the best ingredients from their local area, our chefs each create a starter, a fish course, a meat course and a dessert that they feel epitomises all that's best about their beloved region.

At the end of each week the two chefs representing the featured region present their dishes to an expert judging panel who decide which chef's menu goes forward to the national final.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:26:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOOD TV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-09-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:00:00</td></tr></table>
