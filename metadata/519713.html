This makes him the first former US President to be convicted of a criminal offence. Trump could face up to 136 years behind bars.  His sentencing next month falls just four days before the Republican Party's National Convention. 
That's when party members will nominate who they want as their next president.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-06-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:30:00</td></tr></table>
