How do the foods we eat affect climate change? In a talk that challenges widely-held beliefs about the climate benefits of food choices, environmental studies professor Peter Newton draws on evidence and data to show that the idea that buying local food will reduce carbon emissions is misguided. Rather, if we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the food system, much greater impact would be achieved by reducing our consumption of animal products. Peter Newton is an Assistant Professor in the Environmental Studies Program at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he teaches classes on food systems and the environment. He conducts research in the US and Brazil, where he studies the impacts of policies and programs that affect food systems, tropical forests, and rural livelihoods.
