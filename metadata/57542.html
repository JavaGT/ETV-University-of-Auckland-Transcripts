But for many stroke patients, there's a lot that can be done through quick medical attention, good rehabilitation and community support. 

In this program, two stroke victims take us through their experiences and explain the affects stroke has had on their lives. We speak to experts, including Professor John Olver, Director of Rehabilitation at Epworth HealthCare to help us understand more about the physiology of stroke, what a stroke actually is, the warning signs, symptoms and risk factors.
