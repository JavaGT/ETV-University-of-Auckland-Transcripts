Ten local schools in south Auckland came together last week to enjoy the Ōtara Manākitanga Fun Festival, a chance for students to put aside their school books and have some good old-fashioned fun.

Julia Arnott-Neenee carved out an international technology career before returning home to co-found &lsquo;PeopleforPeople&rsquo;, a social enterprise committed to achieving digital equity. 

It&rsquo;s tech week and Ōtara 4.0 is doing its best to encourage people into the technology sector. The group launched a series of talanoa in south Auckland to introduce students to Māori and Pacific industry veterans. Reporter Soana Aholelei was also in attendance.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, Magazine, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Pacifica, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>09:30:00</td></tr></table>
