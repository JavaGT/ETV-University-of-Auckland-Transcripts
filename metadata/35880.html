Cleary proud of beaten Warriors
Outgoing coach Ivan Cleary couldn't sign off his Warriors career with a first NRL premiership, but expressed his pride at the performance of his young side as they went down 24-10 to Manly yesterday.
With 17 minutes remaining, the Sea Eagles looked home and hosed, with an 18-2 lead.
However, led by the brilliant Shaun Johnson, the Warriors launched a spirited fightback with tries from Manu Vatuvei and Elijah Taylor, only for Jamie Lyon to seal the contest with a four-pointer late in the game.
Cleary refused to blame some dubious refereeing decisions that went against his side in the first half for the defeat, but felt there should have been a penalty in the build up to Daly Cherry-Evans' crucial try on the stroke of halftime.
