There are isolated places in America that appear untouched, but underneath the surface, these beautiful landscapes reveal a much more sinister reality - a dumping ground for bodies and a home to countless unsolved murders. Killing Fields heads to the small community of Iberville Parish, Louisiana, and revisits the case of Eugenie Boisfontaine, a Louisiana State University graduate student who was last seen near LSU&rsquo;s lakes in June 1997. Two months later, Eugenie&rsquo;s body was found nearby in a watery ditch with evidence of blunt force trauma to her head. Detective Rodie Sanchez was assigned to the case in 1997 and hasn't stopped thinking about it since. He makes the bold decision to come out of retirement and gets permission to re-open the case. With advancements in forensic science and DNA analysis, a lot has changed since 1997. But will this be enough to crack the case for good? And will Rodie be able to finally rest and move beyond the case that has forever haunted him? Killing Fields follows the investigation in real time in the pursuit of justice.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, History, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-01-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
