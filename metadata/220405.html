The story of Sweet Tooth follows 10-year-old boy-deer hybrid Gus (Christian Convery). His sensitive ears prick up at the suggestion of danger, and flop when he is sad. Alongside Tommy Jepperd (Nonso Anozie), they explore the wasteland left of America in search of safety.

While they figure out their path, a doctor is trying to find a cure to the mysterious disease ravaging the world, causing mass death. No one knows whether the disease caused the hybrids to appear, but many surviving people are terrified of them.

Sweet Tooth, a story about a hybrid deer-child in a post-pandemic world seeking safe harbour, was filmed across New Zealand during Level 3 and 2 lockdown.

The majority of the beautiful vista sequences were shot in the South Island, but many were also filmed closer to Auckland in Hunua, including the popular picnic spot at the Falls.

Auckland&rsquo;s Hunua Falls were included among scenic filming locations for Sweet Tooth. Glenbrook Rail, Glenbrook Steel Mill, Kingseat Hospital and Rainbow&rsquo;s End were also used

Another location was Adrenalin Forest, a high-wire adventure park in Bombay that had to close between March and September last year amidst the pandemic. Since then, the forest has been frequented by productions booking out the entire park for their shooting.

The Sweet Tooth cast and crew were predominantly New Zealanders, as were 28 heads of departments, and the costume designer and stunt coordinator. Three episodes were directed by Kiwis Toa Fraser and Robyn Grace, and Mel Turner was the local producer.

Stefan Knight was among locals working on Sweet Tooth.Knight headed the hair, makeup and prosthetics department of the production, leading a 22-person team (all but one of whom were New Zealanders) that created the looks for the human and hybrid cast.

The team sought out children that already had a hint of the animal they might portray as a hybrid, so that their prosthetics could be petite, with only minor changes to their faces.

Knight said as children grew into their faces, some of their features might be exaggerated like their eyes, nose or forehead, making them a good fit for different creatures.

&ldquo;Some of the characters had a tiny, tiny end-of-nose prosthetic that just changed the shape of their nostril, and that was enough to give the suggestion of the animal. With the hair added in and their performance it gave you the sense of what animal they were crossed with.&rdquo;
