Protests erupt in Senegal after the president indefinitely postpones elections.
Senegalese President Macky Sall made a surprise announcement on Saturday &ndash; indefinitely postponing elections scheduled this month.

He cited controversy surrounding the disqualification of some presidential candidates.

The opposition has accused Sall of trying to cling to power, and protests have taken place in the capital, Dakar.

Senegal is viewed by many as the continent&rsquo;s most stable democracy and a rare pillar of stability in West Africa, where its neighbours have faced coups and civil wars.

Sall says he&rsquo;s not going to run for a third term.

But with no new date for the presidential election, what&rsquo;s next for Senegal ?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-02-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
