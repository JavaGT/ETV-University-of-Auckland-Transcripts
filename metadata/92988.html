About Love Child
1969, Kings Cross; the time and place Australia came of age and a new generation broke all the rules.

It&rsquo;s the Summer of Love. Mick Jagger&rsquo;s in town, Australians are glued to the telecast of the moon landing as American sailors clash on the streets with anti-Vietnam war protestors.

Joan Millar, 28, a maverick midwife returns to Australia from swinging London to work at Kings Cross General hospital.

Inside the gates of the hospital is one of the busiest maternity wards in the country. Outside the gates, the bright neon lights of Kings Cross beckon promising freedom, sexual revolution, music and mayhem.

Despite all the bright lights, Joan soon finds herself swept up in the plight of five young women in the unwed mother&rsquo;s home attached to the hospital.

There&rsquo;s Viv, a rebellious country girl; Martha, a streetwise survivor; Patricia, the society princess; Shirley, the older woman masking a secret and Annie, the girl who always played by the rules.

Setting out to fight for these young women and their babies, Joan finds herself battling the Matron of the hospital, Frances Bolton and the charismatic Dr. Patrick McNaughton &ndash; turning life at Kings Cross hospital upside down and along the way finding love, heartbreak and extraordinary friendship.
