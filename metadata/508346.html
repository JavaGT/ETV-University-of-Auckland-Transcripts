Wolfe. &ldquo;There was this incredible cross-fertilization, cultural appropriation.&rdquo;  While brash American women flapped their way to newfound freedoms, heroines of Broadway like Marilyn Miller become a testament to pluck and luck.  It&rsquo;s the age of &ldquo;Whoopee&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Charleston,&rdquo; Runnin&rsquo; Wild and the George White Scandals.  In 1921, a jazz show like no other arrives:  Shuffle Along, which features a rich, rousing score by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake, reopening Broadway&rsquo;s doors to black talent.  Unique talents like the Marx Brothers and Al Jolson &shy;&ndash; a Jewish immigrant and Prohibition&rsquo;s biggest star &ndash; rocket to stardom.  The Gershwin brothers, the minstrels of the Jazz Age, bring a &ldquo;Fascinating Rhythm&rdquo; to an entire nation.  Innovative songwriting teams like Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart ignite a new age of bright, clever lyrics with the massive hit &ldquo;Manhattan.&rdquo;  But as the Roaring Twenties come to a close, Broadway&rsquo;s Jazz Age suffers the one-two punch of the &ldquo;talking picture&rdquo; and the stock market crash, triggering a massive talent exodus to Hollywood and putting an end to Broadway&rsquo;s feverish expansion.

The episode features interviews with actor Carol Channing, Gershwin sister Frances Gershwin Godowsky, Al Jolson &amp; Co. creator Stephen Mo Hanan, critic Margo Jefferson, writer Miles Krueger, New Yorker theater critic John Lahr, radio host/music critic Jonathan Schwartz, theater historians Max Wilk and Robert Kimball, and director/producer George C.Wolfe.  Highlights include rare performance footage of composer Eubie Blake and a specially animated sequence of Rodgers and Hart&rsquo;s 1927 hit &ldquo;Thou Swell&rdquo; from A Connecticut Yankee.
