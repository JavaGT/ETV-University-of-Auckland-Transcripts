About series:
The old guard meets the new.

In the early 1990s, Boston was rife with violent criminals emboldened by local law enforcement agencies in which corruption and racism was the norm &ndash; and then it all changed in what was called the &ldquo;Boston Miracle.&rdquo; In this fictional account, driving that change is assistant district attorney Decourcy Ward, who comes from Brooklyn and forms an unlikely alliance with a corrupt yet venerated FBI veteran, Jackie Rhodes. Together, they take on a family of armoured car robbers from Charlestown in a case that grows to involve, and ultimately subvert, the entire criminal justice system of Boston.
