After capturing HR head Alonzo Quinn in the previous episode, Reese and Carter are trekking across town to deliver him to the FBI. Officer Simmons alerts both HR and several criminal groups of Reese's identity, so his means of moving across the city become limited. After fighting several thugs and corrupt police officers working for HR, the trio breaks into the city morgue. Meanwhile, Fusco is captured by HR while relaying information to Carter; he is subsequently tortured by Simmons and an accomplice, Detective William Petersen (Lee Tergesen), who now have the key to Carter's safe deposit box but don't know the location. After refusing to give the location of the safe deposit box containing damning evidence against HR, Simmons sends one of his men, Lin (Khalil Kain), to kill Fusco's son (Sean McCarthy). Shaw, anticipating that move, breaks into Fusco's house and kills Lin, saving the child. Eventually, Fusco frees himself by breaking his own thumb to get free of the handcuffs and kills Petersen. Holed up in the morgue, Reese and Carter bond and Reese surprisingly shows his true feelings for her by kissing her. Suddenly, a group of HR cops infiltrates the morgue and shut off the power, trapping Reese, Carter and an unconscious Quinn in the room. Reese distracts Carter and leaves via an airduct in an attempt to distract the corrupt cops while Carter flees to the FBI with Quinn. Reese manages to kill or disable all but one of the HR cops, and leads the final one out onto the street. Finch organizes for two honest policemen to arrest Reese as a means of escape from HR. During this time, Carter breaks free of the room and manages to bring Quinn to FBI Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. The episode skips forward to a news report revealing that Quinn was charged with multiple offenses and HR was disbanded with the exception of a few rogue officers, one of those being the now-fugitive Simmons. The episode skips forward once again to Carter (now promoted back to detective) walking up the steps of her station's entrance, where she is stopped by Finch. She tells Finch she has deduced he must have some sort of computer with access to government feeds. Later, she and Reese leave the station where he was being held. The two talk, and Reese expresses his gratitude that Carter was with him in the morgue. Finch is parked down the street and is waiting for Reese, and a nearby payphone starts ringing. Finch freezes to go answer it, and Simmons suddenly appears from down the street and opens fire on Reese and Carter, hitting Reese in the shoulder and chest and Carter in the heart. Simmons is shot by Carter as she falls, but he is merely wounded and escapes. Both severely injured from the attack, Reese holds Carter in his arms as she begins to lose consciousness. She makes Reese promise to take care of her son, and dies. Reese attempts to hold back tears as Finch stares on in shock and the payphone continues to ring unanswered.
