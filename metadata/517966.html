Broadcaster and wordsmith Kel Richards explores how the term &lsquo;technoference&rsquo; was coined. 

According to Mr Richards the term &lsquo;technoference&rsquo; was coined by Adelaide academic Mary Brushe. 

&ldquo;It's a combination of technology and interference, and technology is interfering with little kids,&rdquo; Mr Richards told Sky News host Peta Credlin.

&ldquo;She discovered that with average three-year-old in Australia are having three hours of screen time every day. 

&ldquo;The result she says is those little kids are missing on hearing about a thousand adult words in that time and missing out on about 200 conversations in that time. 

&ldquo;Unless parents start changing how they function we are raising a generation who won&rsquo;t have that connection and communication that words give us.&rdquo;
