Through this series of four short documentaries, &lsquo;Te Waiora&rsquo; aims to showcase these individuals, educators and passionate advocates of the transformative power of the water. 

After his own miraculous survival at sea, ex-Navy diver Rob Hewitt turned his focus to helping Māori dive safely, but he never could have predicted that he would find himself on the other side of a rescue operation involving one of his own divers.

&ldquo;Ko au ko koe, ko koe ko au. The waters that flow through me, are the waters that flow through you.&rdquo;

For Rob Hewitt, diving is more than a passion. Working with Water Safety New Zealand, Rob has become an ambassador for providing New Zealanders, particularly indigenous Māori, with the skills they need to dive safely. 

In 2019, nearly half of all drownings happened whilst gathering kaimoana and with Māori overrepresented in drowning statistics, Hewitt knew he had to do something. 

Through the Kia Maanu Kia Ora (Stay Afloat, Stay Alive) initiative, he has been providing dive programmes for Māori, to help them connect to Tangaroa and try to reduce these devastating statistics we hold in Aotearoa. 

On Christmas Eve 2019 and after completing one of the dive programmes, Hewitt headed out to gather kaimoana with a few of the other divers. What unfolded was in slow motion to him as one of the divers, Todd Russell, got caught in a rip and was unable to get back to the boat. As Hewitt found himself suddenly on the other side of a rescue not dissimilar from his own, both him and Todd needed to put all of their training into practice in order to survive.
