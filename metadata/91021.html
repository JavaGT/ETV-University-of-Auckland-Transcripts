Plus Mark challenges their artistic skills

The 2014 edition of The Block NZ will again see four New Zealand teams compete to renovate four dilapidated houses in an upmarket suburb &ndash; room-by-room, week-by-week, challenge-by-challenge &ndash; and sell them at auction for the highest price.

The four teams will literally live and breathe their DIY project for the shoot, living on site in The Block NZ houses. There are no further eliminations; the winning couple is simply decided by the toughest judge of all, the real estate market. All four renovated houses will go to a LIVE TV auction, with The Block NZ 3 crown, and an additional cash prize, going to the couple whose property sells for the most over reserve.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:07:52</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Design, Economics, Engineering, New Zealand, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
