Founded in Zimbabwe by former Australian special forces soldier and anti-poaching leader Damien Mander, the women-only team of rangers, drawn from the abused and marginalized, is revolutionizing the way animals are protected, communities are empowered&mdash; and its members&rsquo; own lives are being transformed. Mander&rsquo;s innovative approach to conservation calls for community buy-in rather than full-on armed assault against poachers: If a community understands the economic benefits of preserving animals, then it will eliminate poaching without an armed struggle. Executive produced by three-time Academy Award winner James Cameron and directed by Maria Wilhelm, AKASHINGA: THE BRAVE ONES is a celebration of the courage, conservation and unorthodox thinking that&rsquo;s leading to massive positive change.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:12:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Criminology, Ecology & Environment, Science, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-10-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:25:00</td></tr></table>
