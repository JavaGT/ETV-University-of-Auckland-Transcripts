The Leaders Debate is part of Decision '14, authoritative and comprehensive coverage of the General Election from TV3's leading news service. 

Producer Keith Slater says that John Campbell is the best in the business in ensuring viewers get to see an insightful and entertaining meeting of our political leaders. &quot;John will step in to keep things on track, but he wants the leaders to debate real issues with each other rather than responding to series of questions from outside parties,&quot; Slater explains. &quot;Ten days out from the general election, this debate will be crucial in helping viewers rate the contenders and make their minds up.&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:06:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-09-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:40:00</td></tr></table>
