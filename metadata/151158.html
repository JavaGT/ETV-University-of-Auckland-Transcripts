This season, U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades and hedge fund king Bobby &ldquo;Axe&rdquo; Axelrod struggle for survival against new foes while still managing to fit in time for destroying each other.

A new attorney general, Waylon &ldquo;Jock&rdquo; Jeffcoat, arrives on the scene and has his attention laser-focused on both men. Taylor, Axe&rsquo;s gender non-binary CIO, makes their return in what is considered the first non-binary character on American television.
