<tr><td align='left' valign='top'>etv/samsara_rialto_20140802_1120_640x360</td><td  align='left' valign='top'>Samsara</td><td align='left' valign='top'>The team behind Baraka reunites for another journey around the world in Samsara, exploring themes of birth, life, death and rebirth through stunning visuals and music.

Samsara is a Tibetan word that means the ever turning wheel of life, and the film is an unparalleled sensory experience. Baraka director Ron Fricke reunites with producer Mark Magidson to expand on their effort to portray the connections between humanity and nature in a bold way. 

Shot for over four years and across 26 countries, the film transports us through multiple cultures to sacred grounds, disaster sites, industrialized zones and natural wonders.

By dispensing with dialogue and descriptive text, the film makers subvert our expectations of a documentary. Instead, they encourage our own interpretations inspired by mesmerising visuals and musical compositions that infuse the ancient with the modern.
