Living with Parasites</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Dr Michael Mosley explores the bizarre and fascinating world of parasites by turning his body into a living laboratory and deliberately infesting himself with them. He travels to Kenya to give himself a tapeworm - a parasite that can grow to many metres inside the human gut. He also encounters lice, leeches and the deadly malaria parasite, before swallowing a pill-camera to reveal what is growing within him. By the end of his infestation Michael learns a new-found respect for these extraordinary creatures, which can live off and even take control of their hosts for their own survival.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:57:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Chemistry, Health, Photography, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC KNOWLEDGE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-12-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
