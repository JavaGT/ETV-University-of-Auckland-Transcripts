This episode takes us to the little-known world of the Mayan Empire. It delves into the culture, unique weaponry (like the atlatl and obsidian club), and scientific achievements of the Mayans. Recent archaeological discoveries unearth secrets of a warrior society, one built on human sacrifice, bizarre rituals and deadly weapons. A battle at Dos Pilas leads to the downfall of this society.

'Warriors' is a documentary series hosted by Terry Schappert, a sergeant in the United States Army Special Forces. The show focused on historical warrior cultures, major battles, and military leaders. Each episode focuses on Schappert immersing himself in a different warrior group. He talks with historians and weapons experts, samples the armor and equipment, and practices with their weaponry, all in order to learn each group's techniques and frame of mind. Each episode usually displayed a reenactment of a major &quot;signature battle&quot; of the warrior culture being presented.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, History, Political Studies, Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-11-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
