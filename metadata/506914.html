Dawkins died in July 2014. In this interview for 2003 TV series Give It A Whirl he covered many topics, including:  

Persuading The Fourmyula's Wayne Mason that 'Nature' had the makings of a hit (3 minutes in)

Recording bands quickly in the early days, &quot;like lightening&quot;; with some albums completed in only two days (8 minutes)

Dragon towering over him, as he ordered the band to do another take &mdash; and how he almost got in trouble after adding jungle sounds and marimbas to their breakthrough hit 'April Sun in Cuba' (11 minutes)

Crafting the distinctive sound of Mi-Sex hit 'Computer Games' &mdash; and trying to get the sequencer to work (20 minutes)

Witnessing Dragon singer Marc Hunter riling up crowds during a concert in Texas (20 minutes)

How Kiwi bands generally had more grounding and hunger than their Australian equivalents (32 minutes)</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:36:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Media Studies, Music, New Zealand, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-12-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:01:00</td></tr></table>
