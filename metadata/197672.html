Following the journey of undiscovered songwriters as they pitch their original creations to superstar recording artists and a panel of chart-topping music producers in the hope of creating a music collaboration of a lifetime. The star artists each choose three songwriters to take their favorite ideas to the next level. Pairing each songwriter with one of the three producers -- including four-time Grammy winner Ryan Tedder; Grammy-nominated Ester Dean, who is a songwriter of No. 1 hits for Rihanna and Katy Perry; and Grammy-winning country music icon with over 40 No. 1 records Shane McAnally -- the songwriters tailor and evolve their songs to perfectly fit the artists, who choose one winning song to record and release worldwide.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:42</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Music, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Leadership, Media Studies, Music, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Bravo</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-12-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
