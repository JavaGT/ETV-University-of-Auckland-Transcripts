but the global demand for biofuel is threatening the lives of the 45 million people who depend on the rainforest for food. this week's 'doco of the week' is a riveting look at the food versus fuel debate. 

the orang rimba tribe in indonesia watch terrified as the picturesque rainforest they live by is demolished to make way for palm oil plantations. 

&quot;by cutting down the rainforest they are taking away our home, it will be the end of us,&quot; the chief of the tribe, din, cries over the deafening sound of chainsaws. he is surrounded by palm oil plantations as far as the eye can see. 

new plant oils that don't interfere with food production are being developed. but so long as there is a high demand and big business to be made, vast areas of land are being designated for biofuel plantations. the orang rimba tribe, who call themselves the children of the forest, beg for food on the sumatra highway as car after car passes them by.
