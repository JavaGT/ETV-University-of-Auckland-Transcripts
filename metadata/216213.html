Set in the heart of the Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent, ten home potters from around the country head to Stoke-on-Trent, the home of pottery, in their quest to become Top Potter.

It is a contest in the style of The Great British Bake Off and The Great British Sewing Bee but with the craft of pottery rather than baking or sewing. This year, the Thrown Down introduces its third new presenter. The latest run will be fronted by Siobhan McSweeney, who&rsquo;s perhaps best known for playing the formidable Sister Michael in hit sitcom Derry Girls, while judge Sue Pryke isn&rsquo;t returning. Instead, her place is being taken by Richard Miller.

Those who&rsquo;ve seen the programme in the past will recognise him as &lsquo;kiln man Rich&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s appeared in every series so far, starting out in the background helping to set up challenges and assisting the potters wherever possible. During the last run, he got a little more screen time, so the show&rsquo;s makers clearly felt he was ready to make the step up to judge. He certainly has the background for it &ndash; for the past 12 years, he&rsquo;s been running handmade tile company Froyle Tiles in Surrey and has his own studio, where he produces work inspired by historical design.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:45:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment, Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Careers, Design, Media Studies, Technology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-10-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
