About series:
Edith and Phil are still determined to escape to the Mediterranean sun. But life conspires, and the dream seems to be drifting further away.

Roger, always broke, hits on the idea of running Edith&rsquo;s spare bedroom as a bed and breakfast &ndash; a plan he hasn&rsquo;t quite got round to sharing with his mother. And when his first guests arrive just as Joan &ndash; Edith&rsquo;s difficult sister &ndash; comes to stay, chaos in the house reaches its peak.

Roger and Bob the burglar decide to become buskers, with Methuselah the crocodile (Roger&rsquo;s glove puppet) doing the singing. Surprisingly, they&rsquo;re a big hit, but their lack of a license leads to trouble with the police.

Meanwhile Wendy, now divorced from Roger, surprises everyone by writing a bestselling children&rsquo;s book about a family of lemmings. But Phil is outraged when he realizes the antics of the lemming family are directly based on them all.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:46</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-02-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
