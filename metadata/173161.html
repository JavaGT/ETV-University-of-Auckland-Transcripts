In this new comedy from the grateful husbands and devoted fathers who wrote The Hangover, Amy has a seemingly perfect life--a great marriage, over-achieving kids, beautiful home and a career. However she's over-worked, over-committed and exhausted to the point that she's about to snap. Fed up, she joins forces with two other over-stressed moms on a quest to liberate themselves from conventional responsibilities--going on a wild, un-mom-like binge of long overdue freedom, fun and self-indulgence--putting them on a collision course with PTA Queen Bee Gwendolyn and her clique of devoted perfect moms.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:02:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment, Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, Media Studies, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-11-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
