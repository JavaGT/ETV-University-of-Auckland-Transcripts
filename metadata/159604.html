About series:
&quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot; creators Danny McBride and Jody Hill team again for a dark comedy series -- no surprise there! -- that may place high school administrators in a wholly different light. McBride and Walton Goggins co-star as vice principals at North Jackson High School, which becomes ground zero for a major power struggle when the principal retires. The rival administrators set their sights on the vacated top spot -- only to see English teacher Dr. Belinda Brown enter the picture. Putting their mutual hate aside, the bitter antagonists form an unholy alliance to bring down the outsider by any means necessary.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Media Studies, Teaching</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-01-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
