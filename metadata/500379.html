However, loss of brain function following stroke and other brain injuries, and post-mortem findings suggested that the brain is divided into distinct processing units.
For example, damage to the parts of the brain were found to lead to specific problems in speaking and understanding of language. It is only in recent decades that functional neuro-imaging of the living brain has become possible.
In functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiments, the subject usually alternates between performing a mental task and resting (or undertaking an alternative task) while repeated images of the brain are rapidly acquired. Areas of the brain in which there are strong correlations between the performance of the task and the MRI signal time course are then identified as having been involved in that task.
When the subject starts to perform the task, neuronal activity increases in those parts of the brain required. These areas require additional energy, which is provided by an increase in the regional blood supply. This increase in blood flow leads to an increase in the blood oxygenation level, which in turn changes the magnetic properties of the blood and hence the MRI signal.
Such MRI studies are giving new insights into the workings of both healthy and diseased brains. In Christchurch there is particular interest in applying MRI to Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, depression, swallowing disorders, and responses to facial expressions.
