He also carries out a great experiment using UV glow sticks and some naturally florescent liquids. IMPORTANT: you will need one adult with a sense of scientific wonder......

The items you will need for this experiment are:
A UV light
Tonic water
An energy drink
Glow sticks
Two beakers/glass containers
 
1. Put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands from the chemicals
2. Get an adult to cut open a glow stick, you'll find that there is another stick within the first stick.
3. Carefully empty the contents of the biggest stick into one beaker.
4. Carefully cut open the second stick and empty that contents into another beaker.
3. You can now mix the two different chemicals together to watch their chemiluminescence - turn the lights down for added effect.
