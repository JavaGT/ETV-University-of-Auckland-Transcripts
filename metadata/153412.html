About series:
Inspired by actual events, this fascinating series delves in to the trials and triumphs of one of America&rsquo;s wealthiest and unhappiest families, the Gettys. Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.

Told over multiple seasons and spanning the 20th century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldn&rsquo;t pay for the return of a loved one? Paul&rsquo;s grandfather, J. Paul Getty Sr., an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. He&rsquo;s busy. Paul&rsquo;s father, J. Paul Getty Jr., is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paul&rsquo;s mother, Gail Getty is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, she&rsquo;s broke. This season charts the teenage grandson&rsquo;s nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.
