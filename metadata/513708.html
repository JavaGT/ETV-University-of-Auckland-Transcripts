The results contained extreme forms of representational bias - including colourist and racist depictions, which is something that AI image generators are often prone to doing.

With AI image generators like MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, and Dall-E gaining huge popularity, it&rsquo;s important that we are vigilant about the forms of bias that these technologies can fuel.

This video was inspired by an LIS undergraduate student&rsquo;s end of first year project, &lsquo;Beyond the Hype: Understanding Bias in AI and its Far-Reaching Consequences&rsquo; by Ana Howard.
