The Jennings receive orders to infiltrate the encryption system that the FBI have recently adopted. Meanwhile, a KGB agent under emotional distress risks the exposure of a crucial KGB network.

The premise is that a group of Soviet KGB officers have been trained to impersonate American citizens, so that each one can become a sleeper agent, with a cover which may even include an unwitting spouse and family.
