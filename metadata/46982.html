The chefs cook their fish course, but which one will prevail? Will it be Paul Ainsworth with monkfish 'Two Showings', Nathan Outlaw with mackerel, horseradish and oyster sauce or Simon Hulstone with 'The Swimming Pool'?

Great British Menu is back and the fight is on as some of the UK's greatest chefs battle for the chance to secure a place for their recipes on the Great British Menu.
