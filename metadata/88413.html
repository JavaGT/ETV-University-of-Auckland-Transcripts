The auction specialists bid on thousands of lost and seized vehicles at the Tampa Machinery Auction in Florida. Everyone battles over a half-finished, vintage 1976 Corvette, and Mark discovers a rare gem left in the back seat of a vehicle up for auction.

With millions of items of luggage going missing each year, the buying and selling of unclaimed property can be a profitable business. Baggage Battles follows three shrewd auction specialists, streetwise Billy Leroy, cocky new-comer Mark Meyer and oddball couple Laurence and Sally Martin, as each provides knowledgeable insights into the tricks of the trade. Travelling to some of the most important auctions around the world, including airport, unclaimed freight and shipping and police seizure auctions, each team member must rely on their savvy expertise to find the hidden treasures as their bids are based on sight-unseen instincts. With dozens of auctions to travel to, thousands of items to explore, and millions of dollars at stake, these specialists need both skill and luck to hit the jackpot. The bidding can be intense and the rivalry fierce as the specialists stalk each other across the auction room.
