For the second time in 16 years, a presidential candidate on the losing side of the popular vote has still won the presidency in the United States. It happened to Al Gore when he ran against former President George Bush in the 2000 election. And history repeated itself this year. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, whose popular vote lead continues to grow, conceded to President-elect Donald Trump after the November election. Clinton has the largest popular vote lead in history, but she lost the Electoral College 306 to 232. The College is made up of 538 electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. They will meet on December 19 to cast their ballots, officially electing the president of the United States.
