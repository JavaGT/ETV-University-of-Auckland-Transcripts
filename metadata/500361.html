Traditionally NMR/MRI is performed using laboratory or clinic based superconducting magnets, but now it is moving out into industry in the form of portable permanent magnet-based systems. &lt;br&gt; NMR development is being driven by advances in electronics, computing and magnet technology and so continues to advance in capability and application. Researchers at Massey University and Victoria University are working together to develop portable NMR technologies for applications such as the monitoring of the properties of rubber, polymers, timber, concrete and many other materials. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Dr Robin Dykstra, a Research Officer in the Institute of Fundamental Sciences at Massey University.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:04:15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
