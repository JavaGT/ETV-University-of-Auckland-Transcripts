About series:
Tiny Heirloom bills itself as the world's premiere tiny home builder, allowing clients to downsize but not downgrade at the same time. Offering high-end amenities like marble countertops, custom cabinetry, large picture windows, spa-inspired bathrooms, real wood accents, and solar panels, Tiny Heirloom puts a luxurious twist on an already popular platform. Each episode features founder Tyson Spiess and his wife, Michelle, leading their team on a home build from start to finish, aiming to fit every wish item into a space suited to travel anywhere. The Portland, Ore.-based company also employs Michelle's two brothers and their wives.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:31:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Art, Design, Economics, Engineering, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-09-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:55:00</td></tr></table>
