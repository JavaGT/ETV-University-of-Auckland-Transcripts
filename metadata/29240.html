This dramatised documentary covers formative events in Australia's history, including the Rum Rebellion and early court cases, which established independence and civil rights for all settlers. 'Rogue Nation' explores how a fledgling colony on the wrong side of the globe was rapidly transformed from a place of punishment to a place of opportunity; a confident and prosperous community. It goes behind the power struggles between wealthy landowners, the educated offspring of convict settlers and the governors who ran the colony.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:00:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Geography, History, Law, Political Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-01-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:29:00</td></tr></table>
