Scotland and Catalonia are well-known hotspots in Europe for their struggles for independence.

And with nationalists winning big in recent regional elections, there has been more pressure on the government to negotiate.

French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Corsica on Tuesday against the backdrop of rising nationalist sentiment on the island.
