The world we live in today is, in many ways, characterized by the decades-long conflict between East and West.
Who were the players in the &quot;ultimate poker game&quot; between East and West? Who really had their fingers on the trigger, and who was just bluffing? What were the stakes? This series sets to shed new light onto the history of the Cold War, not merely as a series of events, but focusing on the multi-faceted stories behind the images we all know so well.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-10-26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
