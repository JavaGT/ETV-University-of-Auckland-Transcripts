Experts tell UpFront that anti-Semitism is surging in the United States, and globally.
The past five years have seen an increase in anti-Semitic violence around the world.

We have witnessed mass shootings at synagogues, violent attacks on Jewish people in the streets and Jewish cemeteries desecrated. And while anti-Semitism is not new, the current social and political landscape across much of the globe has given rise to conspiracy theories, as populist leaders aim to exploit anti-Semitic tropes for political gain.
