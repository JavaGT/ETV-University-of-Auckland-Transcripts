Toxic gas levels have kept rescuers out, and a test shaft is being drilled through 150m (500 feet) of rock. The only relief for helpless families on Sunday was being taken to view the mine, reports the BBC's Greg Ward. No contact has been made with the miners since Friday's blast at the mine near Greymouth on the South Island. Rescuers say they have &quot;no idea&quot; how long it might take to reach the men, but they insist they remain positive about finding them alive. The missing workers, aged from 17 to 62, include 24 New Zealanders, two Australians, two Britons and a South African.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-11-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:30:00</td></tr></table>
