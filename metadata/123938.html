The Chasers are Anne Hegerty, Mark Labbett, Paul Sinha and Shaun Wallace. Labbett and Wallace have both been Chasers since Series 1, while Hegerty joined in Series 2 and Sinha in Series 4.

A team of four contestants individually attempt to amass as much money as possible, which will later be added to a prize fund if the contestant survives their individual chase. The Chaser's job is to catch each contestant during their individual chase, eliminating that person from the game and preventing the money from being added to the collective prize fund. Any contestants who survive their individual chase later play collectively as a team for an equal share of the prize fund against the Chaser.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:37</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Quiz</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Ecology & Environment, Economics, Food Science, Geography, History, Information Technology, Mathematics, Sport, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-12-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:25:00</td></tr></table>
