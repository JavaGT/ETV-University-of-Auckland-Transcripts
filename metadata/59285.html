Do we want to prevent re-offending or are we more interested in offenders getting what they deserve? 

Before prison became a punishment, those convicted of a crime could expect to suffer flogging, the stocks or the pillory, designed to combine public humiliation with physical pain. This episode examines the psychology behind the deliberate infliction of pain and its religious roots. The film explores the fine line between discipline and punishment in the psychology of parenting. The programme examines the use of corporal punishment against children and how the law gradually controlled such violence by restricting it until it was finally outlawed in schools and subjected to significant control in the home.
