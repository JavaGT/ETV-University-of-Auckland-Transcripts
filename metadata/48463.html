In his telemarketing job, Max's 4ft2 height isn't an issue; something that isn't the case when he leaves his friends and family to perform on stage for eight weeks over Christmas. This season, Max lives and works with six other little people. They have all met before and some have previously shared digs, but the seven will live together as a group for the first time. Max sees pantomime as an opportunity to make good money and have fun but his dream is to leave his office job for a full-time acting career.

The film follows him with twin sister Hannah, who doesn't share his condition and has mixed feelings about her brother working in jobs that focus on his height. Interviews with Max, his father, and his best friend Ollie also give insight into growing up as the only little person surrounded by average height family and friends. The group get straight into rehearsals, with some of them having barely looked at their scripts. As a panto veteran, Max takes some of the younger cast under his wing, giving constructive criticism over acting performance and down the pub for Dutch courage. As well as doing panto run-throughs, the dwarves settle into daily life together - getting to know each other's interesting habits and enjoying some well-deserved nights out on the town in Woking, where seven little people find themselves very much the centre of attention.

During the Christmas pantomime season all across Britain, many dwarves take on paying roles in the theatre. This brand new observational documentary series follows the lives of seven dwarf actors as they live together and perform in a production of Snow White at Woking's New Victoria Theatre. Seven Dwarves offers rounded insight into the personal and professional lives of the dwarves and aims to cut across some of the preconceptions that small people often encounter. The series films with this outgoing, intelligent and candid group - from celebrating Christmas Day and New Year's Eve to winding down after performances, out with friends and family, and during their regular lives out of panto season. The dwarves also share what life is like as a small person in frank and candid interviews, all with an infectious sense of humour.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-12-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>09:30:00</td></tr></table>
