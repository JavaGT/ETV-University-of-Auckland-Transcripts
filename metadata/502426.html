Dr. Martens is an iconic British footwear brand, loved the world over for its signature style that unapologetically represents freedom, self-expression, and authenticity.

Formed in 1947, Dr. Martens made headway as a wholesale business and now has more than 100 stores globally, with ambitious plans for retail and e-commerce growth. Recognizing the need to evolve to suit the needs of the twenty-first century consumer, the brand embarked on &ldquo;Project Reboot: Join the Revolution&rdquo; to replace all its legacy applications with Microsoft Dynamics 365.

&quot;It was recognised that we needed a major transformation project to replace all our legacy applications to give us the tools to be able to grow the business&quot;, says Jackie Reid, Program Lead for Project Reboot. &ldquo;Microsoft Dynamics 365 was selected because it gave us an end-to-end solution across all areas of the business.&rdquo;

The solution has been implemented in the United Kingdom and North America and is rolling out across Asia Pacific in 2020. The brand is thriving with its new solution, with benefits being realized across all areas of the business.
