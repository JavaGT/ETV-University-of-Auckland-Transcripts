Quick-Fire Q&amp;A
Q: Currently most excited about in the marketing space?
Technology, technology, technology! There are so many exciting (and inexpensive, or free) tools for marketers to use. These not only manage our initiatives, from email campaigns to event management, but to track ROI &ndash; because marketing loves bringing a tangible return to the business!

Q: First website you check in the morning, and why?
Business Insider (on Twitter) &ndash; insightful articles on a variety of subjects, from professional development to topical issues in the market.
I am also a big fan of the Harvard Business Review as a printed publication, which has excellent thought leadership articles relevant to all business professionals.

Q: Your one guilty pleasure?
While I have a few guilty pleasures (ahem, Game of Thrones), my one celebrity crush is Ma&rsquo;a Nonu. I just adore him!</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:45:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>09:33:12</td></tr></table>
