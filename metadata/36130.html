While the Mt Maunganui's beach clean up was been spectacularly impressive, it was clearly just a small battle in a much larger war.
In less than a day the cleanup crew managed to remove a thick black sheet of oil but with a change of wind or a current movement, it could all be back.
Another battle is raging just a few hundred metres away at Matakana Island, at the western entrance to Taranga Harbour.
This battle is being fought solely by determined locals.

No law change sees NZ footing Rena bill
Last night the Minister of Transport Steven Joyce told us the owners of the Rena were liable for about $12 million to cover the cost of the clean up, and he was right.
That is the maximum they have to pay under law.
It is a formula worked out according to the size of the ship.
But in 2008, a select committee determined the formula was out of date and recommended it be changed to get more money out of the ship's owner.
But, the law was not changed.
If it had been, the shipping company would now have been liable for more than twice the $12 million it now stands to pay.
But that is money we have to come up with instead.

All Blacks veteran reflect on 100 tests
When the All Blacks run onto Eden Park on Sunday against Australia, they will be without Dan Carter and Colin Slade, and they will also be missing veteran Mils Muliaina.
Mils was forced into early retirement last weekend after fracturing his shoulder against Argentina.
While the injury has robbed him of his dream to win a Rugby World Cup, it also happened during a game in which he became just the second player in New Zealand history to reach 100 tests.
It has been a remarkable career, earning him a place amongst the greatest of All Blacks.
This afternoon John Campbell met the man who is not only a fine rugby player but also a good and generous person, and asked if it had been a magic ride.

Breast Cancer Awareness reach out with film project
Today is Pink Ribbon Day and it is Breast Cancer Awareness month.
It's not a new message, but the Breast Cancer Foundation has found a new way of raising awareness.
It has paired seven breast cancer sufferers with seven directors to make seven films.
Seven is also the number of New Zealand women diagnosed every day with breast cancer.
The idea is that you watch the films and share them on Facebook with seven women, they share them with seven women, and so on.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:32:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, New Zealand, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-10-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:59:00</td></tr></table>
