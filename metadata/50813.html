The show follows the investigations of a team of NYPD forensic scientists and police officers as they unveil the circumstances behind mysterious and unusual deaths as well as other crimes. The series is the second indirect spin-off from the veteran series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and directly from CSI: Miami during an episode in which several of the CSI: NY characters made their first appearance. Currently the show airs on Fridays at 9pm/8c on CBS; in the UK it airs on Channel 5 on Saturdays at 10pm with repeats usually shown on 5USA.
Originally, CSI: NY was produced in partnership with the Canadian media company Alliance Atlantis. The company dissolved after season three in 2007, and all production is now done under the purview of CBS Paramount Television.
The show is filmed at the CBS Studio Center with many of the outside scenes shot in and around Los Angeles. Occasionally, scenes are filmed on location in New York City.[3]
On May 13, 2012, CBS renewed the series for a ninth season which consists of 17 episodes airing Fridays at 8pm/7c. On October 10, 2012, after two aired episodes, the time-slot was changed back to 9pm/8c. On December 6, 2012, CBS announced that the season nine finale will air on February 22, 2013</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:55:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
