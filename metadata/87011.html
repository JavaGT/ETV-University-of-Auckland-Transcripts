When their truck breaks down, Ton and Allen lay it all on the line to raise money to fix her. They score a Foosball table, Tommy Gun drums and to Ton&rsquo;s delight, a treasure trove of Twinkies, but will it be enough?

From Brooklyn to Anchorage, from New Orleans to Hawaii, Auction Hunters follows Allen Haff and Ton Jones as they traverse the country in search of treasure hidden in storage units. 

Every year in America, 50,000 storage facilities hold auctions for abandoned storage units. Each unit has the potential to be a goldmine or a bust for those who make their living hunting unclaimed property. 

Auction Hunters cuts the lock and opens the door into high stakes, financial risks and potential rewards where the right purchase can bring in serious cash.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Economics</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-08-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
