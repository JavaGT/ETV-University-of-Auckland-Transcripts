We are using Massey's new 3 million dollar 700 MHz NMR spectrometer to determine the structure of an RNA molecule from a cold virus, as well as to study how this molecule interacts with a viral protein. This interaction is required for replication of viruses, thus the results of this study might eventually be used to develop drugs to block viral replication. The viral conditions/diseases which might be treated in this fashion include hepatitis A, foot-and-mouth disease, polio, the common cold and SARS. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Stephen Headey - a post-doctoral research fellow in Physics at Massey University</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-01-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
