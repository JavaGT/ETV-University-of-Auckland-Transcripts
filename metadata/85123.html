This dramatic documentary is 'behind the scenes' as the company celebrates with a breathtaking new production of an old - fashioned story of sex and violence.

In their 50th year, RNZB's Romeo &amp; Juliet is designed to be a dramatic, sexy, classic - pushing the dancers through the rigours of touring and the nerves and highs of dress rehearsal and opening night. Driving the production are flamboyant new artistic director Gary Harris and internationally recognised choreographer Christopher Hampson. 
Lead dancers Alex Wagner and Jane Turner talk candidly about casting nightmares, stage fright and the blossoming of love on stage. The 2003 production of Romeo and Juliet is a watershed for a company that has survived many threats of closure, devastating fires and financial crises.

Packed with great archive footage and personalities of the past including Sir Jon and Lady Jacqui Trimmer, Russell Kerr, Kerry-Anne Gilberd and Harry Haythorne.

See the gorgeous production that The Independent gave four stars. 50 Years On Their Toes is stunning, evocative documentary about dancing for the love of it.
