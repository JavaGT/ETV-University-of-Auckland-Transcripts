The government would, they said, abolish the BBC&rsquo;s main source of income, the TV licence. Coming off the back of a decade of budget cuts, supporters of the BBC fear that, if Johnson gets his way, it could soon be disfigured beyond recognition.

As serious as the government&rsquo;s warning shots appear to be, they are far from unprecedented. Rather, they represent the latest flare-up in a century-long tussle over the BBC&rsquo;s independence from the British state - one that remains little-known to most of the network&rsquo;s audience. The source of this struggle is a tension between two competing impulses: on one side, there is the journalistic imperative of holding the government to account; on the other, the BBC&rsquo;s dependence on that same government for its livelihood. At times of crisis, the confrontations created by that tension - particularly over the BBC&rsquo;s domestic news and current affairs programming - have threatened its very existence.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Leadership, Media Studies, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-02-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:30:00</td></tr></table>
