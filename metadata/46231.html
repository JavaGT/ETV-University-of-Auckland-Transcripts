This week it's the battle of the North East chefs - returning contender Stephanie Moon and newcomers Colin McGurran and Charlie Lakin. All of them are determined to knock out their rivals in the race to the banquet. Here, they have a chance to impress with their dessert dishes; will it be Stephanie's 'podium of puddings', Charlie's Earl Grey and strawberry souffl&eacute; with gorse flower ice cream, or Colin's chocolate, rhubarb and custard?

Great British Menu veteran Nigel Howarth decides who goes through to the judges on Friday and who is going home.

Great British Menu is back and the fight is on as some of the UK's greatest chefs battle for the chance to secure a place for their recipes on the Great British Menu.

Sourcing the best ingredients from their local area, our chefs each create a starter, a fish course, a meat course and a dessert that they feel epitomises all that's best about their beloved region.

At the end of each week the two chefs representing the featured region present their dishes to an expert judging panel who decide which chef's menu goes forward to the national final.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Food Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOOD TV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-08-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:00:00</td></tr></table>
