When Tere Livingstone went onto the field for a rugby league game he had the rest of his life laid out - a loving partner, a healthy toddler, his own painting business. But within days of receiving a head injury during that fateful game, the 32 year old was dead. His whanau gave Sunday extraordinary access as they said their final farewells in Waikato hospital in the hope that Tere&rsquo;s legacy will encourage change in how concussions are handled in the game he loved, and to encourage others to give the gift of life.

DEEP IMPACT
Our neighbours are about to join an exclusive, if slightly worrying, club. As part of the AUKUS pact, Australia will become just the 7th nation to acquire nuclear powered submarines. At more than three hundred and sixty billion dollars, the cost is beyond substantial. But the politicians who engineered the deal say it will provide something that&rsquo;s impossible to put a price on: stability in our region. This week, we see first-hand what these incredible machines are capable of, with a rare glimpse inside one of the most powerful subs in the world. Channel 9 &lsquo;60 Minutes&rsquo;
 
FRIENDS LIKE THESE
One-time sitcom actor and well-known devotee of Scientology, Danny Masterson, is now also a convicted rapist who&rsquo;ll spend 30 years in jail. During his trial, the Church of Scientology was also condemned, accused of going to extraordinary lengths to protect its star recruit from prosecution. But since Masterson&rsquo;s sentencing there&rsquo;s been more controversy. In letters to the judge asking for leniency for Masterson, actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis described their friend more like a saint than a sinner.
