From the Seven Sharp website:
Our goal is to keep you informed, discuss what you're discussing but never take ourselves too seriously.

We want to celebrate being Kiwi, and not just have a doom and gloom look at the world.

This country is brimming with talent and characters and we want to find the stories around them.
