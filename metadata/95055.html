Adriano runs evening cooking classes throughout the year. They&rsquo;ve always been successful, but he wants to try something new. So he&rsquo;s decided to launch a new series of cooking classes just for kids. The aim is to find aspiring young chefs and teach them how to make simple, mouth-watering desserts for the family. Adriano already has his own mini-me sous-chef: 11-year-old Emily works in The Lab after school two days a week. She skips while she works and puts a smile on everyone she meets, but back to the main game &hellip; the most gregarious and talented of our young chefs will be selected to host a special, fairytale twilight dinner for local mums and dads. Adriano knows how to work with adults, but how will he go with kids?
