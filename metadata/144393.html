About the Series:
The Internet can be a powerful tool, allowing people to communicate and conduct business across borders. Unfortunately, that also makes it easy for people to, often anonymously, threaten others -- or worse -- post content that they don't like. 

This series shows a dramatization of incidents where users gave out too much information and drew negative attention to themselves and family.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Bravo</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
