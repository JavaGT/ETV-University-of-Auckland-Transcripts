A new report out this week has shed light on the fatal mid-air helicopter collision at the Gold Coast in January. The surviving pilot says he didn&rsquo;t hear the other pilot announce he was taking off. Moments later the two aircraft crashed into each other, killing four people. In this story, four of the surviving passengers &ndash; all New Zealanders &ndash; give their first-hand accounts of the terrifying crash and reveal startling new information about the disaster from the lead-up to the collision, the catastrophic impact, and its frightening aftermath.

DISTANCE LEARNING
Tucked away deep in the Marlborough Sounds, Waitaria Bay School is one of the oldest and most remote schools in New Zealand. With a roll of just 16 kids, all learning in the one classroom, it has fought closure twice but, this tiny school, where kids sport Red Band gumboots instead of mobile phones, isn&rsquo;t just surviving. It&rsquo;s thriving.

CRIMES OF FASHION
Fast fashion- we love it. Kiwis queue up at flashy Zara and H &amp; M stores or log in online by the thousands for a chance to grab the latest catwalk looks at a knockdown price. In just a few years fast fashion brands, boosted by social media, have revolutionised the way clothes are made, and the way we buy and wear them. But fast fashion has a huge hidden cost: Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of non-biodegradable polyester clothing is ending up in our landfills every year- unwanted, unseen, unrecyclable. The volume is colossal and going up every week.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Magazine, News, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Health, History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-03-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:03:00</td></tr></table>
