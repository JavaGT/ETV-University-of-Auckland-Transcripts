We&rsquo;re inside one of New Zealand&rsquo;s high security prisons to see what life is really like behind the wire. With unprecedented access, inmates take us into the rough and tough of prison life, sharing their hopes and their regrets. They&rsquo;re the burglars, the drug dealers and the recidivist offenders who have lost their privileges and privacy for a shared cell. But for prison officers, their goal is to keep people safe and aim for rehabilitation. It&rsquo;s an eye-opening story.

BIG FAN
Joel Little may not be a household name, but there&rsquo;s a strong chance you&rsquo;ve heard of his work. He&rsquo;s the Grammy award-winning music producer and songwriter who took Lorde to number one and also produced massive hits for Taylor Swift, Khalid, Sam Smith and the Jonas Brothers. It&rsquo;s music that&rsquo;s made him a lot of money but now, after 4 years of living in Los Angeles, he&rsquo;s returned home to Auckland to give a large chunk it away to help build the music industry here.

THE BLOODY LIE
For more than a decade Elizabeth Holmes told the world she&rsquo;d invented a medical miracle that promised to revolutionise healthcare. In doing so she fooled wealthy investors and became the darling of Silicon Valley. But when whistle-blowers began questioning her claims, Holmes&rsquo; fairytale, along with her company Theranos, was destroyed. Found guilty of fraud, she&rsquo;s now facing more than 11 years in prison. But the whistle-blower who brought it all crashing down reveals how one small mistake almost let Holmes off the hook.
