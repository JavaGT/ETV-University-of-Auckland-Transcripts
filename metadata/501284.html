The site was built in 1937 as part of Nazi Germany's drive to become self-sufficient on fuel, but it was no ordinary refinery. It used the latest technology at the time, at great expense, to turn coal into oil. In 1945 an Allied air raid pulverised the plant, severely wounding the German war machine and leaving the site in ruins. Other structures examined in the first episode include the incredible vertical Phoenix Shot Tower in Baltimore, which was built to provide America's own ammunition, the former American spy instillation called Teufelsberg (or &quot;Devil's Mountain&quot;) in Berlin which waged the Cold War against the Soviet Union, and the now derelict Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse which was built on Europe's second-fastest moving sand dune in Denmark.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:51:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>Design, Engineering, Geography, History, Information Technology, Science, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Duke</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-06-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:15:00</td></tr></table>
