He's pretty much the only one. Everybody loved and missed Dr. Bishop, and pretty much nobody liked Novak. His vendetta against Bishop made him public enemy number one.

In fairness to Dr. Novak, he is a good doctor. He's not all that different from Bash. He pushes boundaries when taking a risk means saving a patient.

Dr. Novak: Now, if I had made this call when I was a resident, I would have been called dangerous.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:52:25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, Health, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PG</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-07-06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>23:30:00</td></tr></table>
