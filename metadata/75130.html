Directed by James Redford, the film not only clears up the misconceptions about the condition, but also paints a picture of hope for all who struggle with it.

Every week we have people asking &ldquo;what can I do?&rdquo;, &ldquo;how can I help?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;do you have something I can give my&hellip; child&rsquo;s teacher, my husband, my staff, my child, my students &hellip; to help them understand?&rdquo; 

Help people understand dyslexia and improve how dyslexia is approached and supported - by showing the film in your community. Empower parents, empower teachers and empower students by dispelling the myths and revealing the truths. By screening this movie, you are creating a more receptive environment for advocacy and constructive change.
