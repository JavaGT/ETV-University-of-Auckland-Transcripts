About series:
Oscar&reg; and Emmy&reg; nominee William H. Macy and Golden Globe nominee Emmy Rossum star in the latest season of this fiercely engaging and fearlessly twisted one-hour series, adapted from the acclaimed British original drama. Chicago-native Frank Gallagher (Macy) is the proud single father of six smart, industrious, independent kids who would be better off without him. When Frank&rsquo;s not at the bar spending what little money they have, he&rsquo;s passed out on the floor. Under the supervision of his eldest daughter, Fiona (Rossum), his kids &mdash; Lip, Ian, Debbie, Carl and Liam &mdash; have found ways to grow up in spite of him. They may not be like any family you know, but they make no apologies for being exactly who they are.
