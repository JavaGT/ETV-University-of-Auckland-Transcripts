Emerging from a working class family in war-torn England, Osbourne and his neighbourhood friends formed Black Sabbath and invented heavy metal. For ten years, Ozzy was happy to feed the myth of the Rock n Roll Wildman, living a life that was extreme even by the most bacchanalian standards of his chosen profession. The life worked for a while, but then it began to back-fire. He lost his family, his wife, even his livelihood when Black Sabbath fired him. The glamour had been leached away and the fun had faded. What was left was an alcoholic with a death sentence. Featuring interviews with his brothers and sisters, as well as Jack, Sharon, Aimee and Kelly Osbourne, God Bless Ozzy Osbourne is about the intoxicating rush of success and the redemption that comes from pulling away from the very thing that made you successful.

With never-before-seen footage uncovered from the archives and interviews with Sir Paul McCartney, Tommy Lee, Henry Rollins and others, it is the first documentary to take viewers inside the mind and psyche of a legendary and timeless cultural figure.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:47</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Concert, Documentary, Interview, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, Music, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-11-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:40:00</td></tr></table>
