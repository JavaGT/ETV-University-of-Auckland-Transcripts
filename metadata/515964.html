In this programme Carmen Roberts explores the historic towns and villages that hug the coast here and discovers why cash incentives are being offered to buyers to relocate and renovate properties in this traditionally less prosperous part of the country. On her journey she also meets the elderly local ladies keeping a pasta tradition alive and learns why a centuries old dance originally performed to cure spider bites is enjoying a revival.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:38</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-12-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
