'Face TV' interviewer Noel Cheer, renowned for his longer format interviews with some of New Zealand's biggest names, had heard the Dalai Lama was heading to New Zealand to pay respects to an old friend in Dunedin and suggested to his Face TV colleagues that they pitch to do the interview.The University of Otago chipped in with a venue and its facilities, following His Holiness holding the Dunedin meeting there.

Sir Lloyd, now 95 and Professor Emeritus of religious studies at Victoria University in Wellington, has embraced controversy in his time even being charged with heresy in the late 1960s for his views. The Dalai Lama showed a matching sharp wit and sense of humour during their meeting.

The result is a unique, in depth conversation with the man who has dedicated his life to the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of inter-religious harmony and the preservation of Tibet's Buddhist culture - a culture of peace and non-violence.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:47:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Asian Studies, New Zealand, Philosophy, Political Studies, Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FACE TV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-07-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
