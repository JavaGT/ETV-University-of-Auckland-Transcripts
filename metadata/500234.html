Twenty five horses were sold to Australian buyers and four to Indian buyers. A Foxbridge Ann Acre colt goes for a record three thousand guineas and the buyer is rumoured to be an agent for Bing Crosby. 02.10 Research, Borer Control: Second grade New Zealand timber is too soft and an easy target for borer. At Owairaka Research Centre in Auckland, scientists are trying to make timber borer-proof. Borer grubs are collected and placed in bottles. Samples of wood to be treated are tested with different types of preservatives. The wood samples and borer are put together in cages and left for 6 weeks. The scientists then count the number of eggs the borer have managed to lay in the wood. 04.50 NZEF Italy, Attack on Faenza: NZ engineers are fighting the Italian mud in the middle of winter, trying to keep vital roads open for the tanks of the NZ Division. For 5 weeks, the 8th Army has been held up at Faenza, a German stronghold on the road to Bolonga - now the Kiwi tanks have been called up to punch forward. Close to the German lines, NZ soldiers find a refugee family living in a haystack. Infantrymen wait for the final assault and mortars pound enemy positions. NZ soldiers cross a bombed-out bridge and go into the silent town of Faenza in single file, always wary of sniper fire. Engineers work to clear the streets of German mines and NZ soldiers talk to Italian partisans as artillery convoys roll into the city. Dazed townspeople emerge from their hiding places to see what is left of their homes and salvage what they can. Some German soldiers are rounded up as POWs. For the NZ troops, it's another well-earned victory.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:08:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
