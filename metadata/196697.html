In many communities the Bushmen are in dire straits, but in Namibia&rsquo;s Kalahari one can still find remote villages where families live in peace and where the elders still know the secrets of nature. The San, as they are often called, know how to find water and food in the desert; they know how to make fire and how to heal with medicinal plants. Today, this knowledge seems obsolete, but it might very well be the key to the future for the Bushmen.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:05:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Anthropology, History, Media Studies, Social Studies, Sociology, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-11-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:35:00</td></tr></table>
