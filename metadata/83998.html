Yet only a select few carried the ultimate weapon of their era: the feared Ulfberht sword. Fashioned using a process that would remain unknown to the Vikings' rivals for centuries, the Ulfberht was a revolutionary high-tech tool as well as a work of art.

Considered one of the greatest swords ever made, it remains a fearsome weapon more than a millennium after it last saw battle. But how did Viking sword makers design and build the Ulfberht, and what was its role in history?

Using cutting edge science and old-fashioned detective work to reconstruct the Ulfberht, we can finally unravel the Secrets of the Viking Sword.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:16</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Science, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-06-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
