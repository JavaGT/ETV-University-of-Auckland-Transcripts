It is the land that changed us from colonists to explorers, a westward-shifting line, first the Appalachian Mountains, then the Louisiana Purchase and finally stretching to the Pacific, that slowly altered the way we spoke, dressed, and lived. Once crossed, it transformed us from Europeans, to revolutionaries, and finally to Americans. With Leonardo DiCaprio on board as Co-Executive Producer and Co-Narrator, Frontiersmen is a docu-drama that follows the people who set forth across the untamed land. DiCaprio will introduce the series as well. The series will span the formative period of American history - the first 75 years from the post-revolutionary war colonies through the Civil War</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:36:04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Engineering, History, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-04-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
