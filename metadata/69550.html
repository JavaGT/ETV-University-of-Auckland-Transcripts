We expected a decision from Hamilton today, given 70 percent of Hamilton's residents backed fluoridation in a recent referendum.
But the city's councillors voted to defer a decision.
They're waiting for the outcome of a judicial review in the New Plymouth High Court, where a Taranaki judge has reserved his decision about the ability of local authorities to put fluoride in drinking water.
This is contentious, and councils are cautious. In Australia it's become so contentious, it's turned ugly.
Even in a beautiful place like Byron Bay.
They've just voted to maintain their fluoride ban after what one councillor describes as the nastiest and hardest debate she's seen in 10 years on council.
