A training camp is being held near Blenheim where recruits are taught how to live under canvas and be self-supporting when a long way in the backblocks. They learn how to dress goat and deer skins, how to look after their rifles and how to cook bread in a camp oven. In the back country of the Kaikouras, the recruits get their first job - to shoot the goats that are eating the tussock and exposing the top soil. There are an estimated 40 thousand goats in the area and 30 parties of two each should clear it in about 3 months. In this steep country, where the goats are wary, the hunters need to be good long-range shots.
