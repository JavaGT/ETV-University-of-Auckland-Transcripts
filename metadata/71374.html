Subject to constant supervision and searches by a menacing GDR officer (Rainer Bock, The White Ribbon) and unable to take so much as an evening stroll without looking over her shoulder, she quickly searches for a way to leave the Eastern bloc once and for all. But her yearnings are gradually transformed as she grows closer to the clinics head doctor, Andre (Ronald Zehrfeld), a gentle loner whos forced to keep tabs on Barbara and whose intentions are never quite clear, though they appear to be good-natured. Their bond is further enhanced by a love of the profession that has them working overtime to care for two troubled patients: a rebellious teenage runaway, Stella (Jasna Fritzi Bauer), and a young man (Jannik Schumann) who attempted suicide for reasons we will learn about later on.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:41:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, German</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-12-31</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
