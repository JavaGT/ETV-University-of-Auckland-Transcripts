Ministry of Defence spooks try to silence the UCOS team when they reinvestigate the death of British soldier Eric Trimble. Just weeks before a tour of duty in Iraq, turning the First Gulf War, Trimble, along with three other squaddies, was sent to the MoD's Influenza Research Unit (IRU) to take part in a medical trial. All four went out drinking one night, but Trimble never returned. He was later found beaten to death two miles from the Unit. Brian's behaviour, meanwhile, causes concern. His new obsession is unmasking the truth.

'New Tricks' is a British comedy-drama that follows the work of the fictional Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad (UCOS) of the Metropolitan Police Service. Originally led by Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman, it is made up of retired police officers who have been recruited to reinvestigate unsolved crimes. The series title is taken from the proverb &quot;You can't teach an old dog new tricks&quot;.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:51:34</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:30:00</td></tr></table>
