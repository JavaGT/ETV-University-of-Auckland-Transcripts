When Gund's estate unexpectedly denies Omar authorisation, Omar is urged by his girlfriend to travel to Uruguay and petition the executor to change their minds. The Gund 'family' living together on the author's isolated and decaying estate includes Gund's widow Caroline, his mistress Arden, her young daughter Portia, Gund's brother Adam, and his partner Pete. Omar's unannounced arrival upsets their fragile co-existence and causes all to question their own circumstances, which in turn leads Omar to question his own fate.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:52:51</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-03-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:35:00</td></tr></table>
