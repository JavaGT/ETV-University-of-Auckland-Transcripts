There are always diamonds to be mined at yard sales. The trick, of course, is finding them. The competitors in &quot;Flea Market Flip&quot; are asked to perform that trick, then they're challenged to refurbish or reinvent the items they've purchased in the hope of reselling them for a profit. Grouped in teams, the contestants in each episode are given a budget of about $500 to hunt for project pieces with potential. The team that does the best job of flipping trash for cash wins $5,000. Passionate flea market fan Lara Spencer, an anchor on &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; hosts.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Careers, Economics, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>HGTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-09-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
