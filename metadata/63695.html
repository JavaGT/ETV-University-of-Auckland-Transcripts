In Hong Kong Julian Hanton tastes both Michelin star and dubious star Chinese cuisine before entering into a reptilian nightmare, eating snake soup served by Hong Kong's very own 'Snake Queen'. Julian also quickly regrets his decision to take one of Bruce Lee's trademark one-inch punches during a visit to a prestigious kung-fu school. 

Julian Hanton tackles Asia in the latest chapter of his on-going investigation into our ever-changing world. With Asia's economy and population booming, what changes will Julian detect from previous visits? Julian's journey begins rather inauspiciously in Hong Kong, where he foolishly volunteers to take one of Bruce Lee's famed one-inch punches at a martial arts school. After a sudden necessity to visit the bathroom shortly thereafter, it's at least a lesson learned. In Thailand, Julian tags along with investigative journalists and is recruited as an undercover spy to film an expos&eacute; on illegal gambling. Once again Julian finds he might have got himself in a little deeper than he would have liked, another lesson learned. Typically, whenever Julian is involved, there appears to be a pattern forming. Subsequent visits to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and China also offer lots more education for Julian. Let's just say Julian is a great student of world travel.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:50:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Asian Studies, Chinese, Food Science, Geography, Sport, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TRAVEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-08-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
