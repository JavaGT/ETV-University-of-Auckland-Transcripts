A lot of people will say the heavy object, but what about those who know both will land at the same time? What do they think? Some believe both objects have the same gravitational pull on them and/or both fall to the ground with the same constant speed. Neither of these things is true, however. The force is greater on the heavy object and both objects accelerate at the same rate as they approach the earth - i.e. they both speed up but  at the same rate.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-08-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:00</td></tr></table>
