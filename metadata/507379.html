But what the team found was a changed world. With a travel industry still in recovery from the effects of the pandemic and travellers facing the new challenge of rising costs and all this set against the backdrop of trying to make every journey sustainable. Join Simon Calder as he looks back at the team's trips from last year and shows you how even though it might seem harder to reach your dream destination there's still ways to travel that are easier on your pocket and the planet.

The Travel Show also heads to Ecuador to find out who really discovered the Equator and in Spain learn about the new art exhibition celebrating Ukrainian art.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:24:23</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-01-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
