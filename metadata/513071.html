Chris Dawson and his identical twin Paul were minor celebrities in the 80s - both handsome rugby league players and models who became high school PE teachers. But in 1982 Chris murdered his wife Lynette. The crime went unsolved for 40 years, as did the fact he was having an affair with a 16-year-old pupil at the time. Now, staggering and serious accusations have come to light about the other twin, Paul Dawson: back in the 1980s he too was having sex with at least one and possibly more of his underage students.

On September 3 2021, Aahamed Samsudeen entered a supermarket in suburban Auckland, picked up a knife, and attacked a number of people, leaving five critically injured. As other shoppers rushed to the aid of those hurt, members of the Special Tactical Unit shot Samsudeen dead. In a matter of just minutes, this terrorism strike at New Lynn Countdown had left an indelible scar on the lives of many of those present. On Sunday, a group of survivors speak for the first time about the emotional and mental toll the random stabbing has had, and why they feel unsupported by a broken system.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Magazine, News, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Health, History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-08-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
