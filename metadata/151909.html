For the first time in 60 years, someone other than Fidel or Raul Castro will govern Cuba. The government has nominated First Vice President Miguel Mario Diaz-Canel as the sole candidate for president. His term is likely to start when Raul steps down during a session of the National Assembly that is underway. 

Raul Castro came to power in 2006 when his older brother Fidel, who had ruled for almost half a century, stepped aside due to deteriorating health.  After assuming control Raul began rolling back some of the restrictions imposed by his older brother. Until 2008, Cubans weren&rsquo;t allowed mobile phones, internet access, or to stay at Cuban hotels and resorts. Perhaps the most historic of his rule was ending a 50 year standoff with the United States when he agreed to work with US President Barack Obama on restoring the two countries&rsquo; diplomatic relations.

It&rsquo;s unclear the path Diaz-Canel will take as a leader. One thing is certain, he&rsquo;ll become president at a time when Cuba faces a serious economic crisis, compounded by the dwindling subsidies from Venezuela, the continuation of US embargos, and major income inequality. So what will Cuba&rsquo;s future be under the new leader? We&rsquo;ll discuss that, and the legacy of the Castros on this episode of The Stream.
