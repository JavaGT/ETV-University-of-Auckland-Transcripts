Coming from a big family, food has always played a really important part in their lives, and although they&rsquo;ve now flown the nest, they still get together on Sundays to share a family meal. Rylan Clark-Neal oversees the action, and the sisters are paired with the versatile Jeremy Pang and the creative Akis Petretzikis. Who will be the winner today and take home the Ready Steady Cook hamper?</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, Food Science, Health, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-07-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:00:00</td></tr></table>
