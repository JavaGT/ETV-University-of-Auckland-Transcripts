About series:
When you&rsquo;ve got everything to lose, you have to raise the stakes.

Moving, funny and surprising, this characterful drama stars BAFTA winner Sheridan Smith as an ordinary working class mum caught between two contrasting worlds &ndash; the everyday grind of suburban life and the high-risk game of insider trading.

Office cleaner Sam is one of an invisible army who work every night in the gleaming buildings of London&rsquo;s financial centre. She dreams of a better life but struggling with an online gambling addiction and spiralling debts, Sam is going under. Until one night, hidden in plain sight, she overhears an illegal trade being made. This lucrative stock market information, if used correctly, could be the break she desperately needs.

Armed with a copy of &lsquo;Trading for Dummies&rsquo; and her gambler&rsquo;s nerve &ndash; Sam has everything and nothing to lose &ndash; but how far is she willing to go to turn her fortunes around?

Starring Sheridan Smith (The Huntsman: Winter&rsquo;s War), Jade Anouka (Trauma), Kristy Phillips (Vera), Uriel Emil (The Great Fire), Neil Maskell (No Offence), Anya McKenna-Bruce (Kingdom) and Hero Fiennes Tiffin.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:46:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-02-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
