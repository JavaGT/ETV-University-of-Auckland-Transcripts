One of the challenges in leading change in schools is to make it meaningful, enduring and sustainable. With education going through increasing amounts of transformative change and research that suggests that two thirds of such change will fail, a vital step in the process is for leaders to develop their knowledge of how to lead change. This session will explore how to lead change successfully and will use Hobsonville Point Secondary School as a case study, looking specifically at personal profession learning programmes, teaching as inquiry and knowledge building.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:16:39</td><td align='center' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-08-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:12:12</td></tr></table>
