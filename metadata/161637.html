In some jobs this might be a virtue but in the Marines, they like you to show you&rsquo;re taking the thing seriously. A goofy grin, Bond&rsquo;s default expression, gives the wrong impression. 

Crucially, Bond needs to show he can switch into soldier mode and become a raw killing machine &ndash; which is no joke. In a key scene he and Recruit Frykman (who at 31 has the opposite problem, of proving he&rsquo;s not too mature) have a head-to-head that may prove decisive. 

It&rsquo;s a slightly fragmented episode that bounces between the two men and their personal problems, while taking in the officers&rsquo; despair at 180 Troop&rsquo;s failings. One corporal wonders aloud, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we horsewhip them outside?&quot;
SUMMARY
The raw recruits take the next step in their training and there are challenging new lessons at every turn. If they can make it through three more weeks, their families will receive invitations to witness their progress and they will be allowed to go home for the first time since the programme began. Callum Bond, 18, tries to face up to a bewildering array of tasks in an effort to transform himself from boy to soldier, and 31-year-old Magnus Frykman struggles to remain on top of everything while missing his family.
