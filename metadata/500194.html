The New Zealand 3rd Division has been trained as an amphibious unit like the US Marines, the first in NZ military history. The convoy leaves Guadalcanal wary of large scale Japanese air attack but US and NZ air support keep the enemy at bay.  The main invading force moves ashore and thousands of men and thousands of tones of equipment lands without trouble. Patrols head out to flush pockets of Japanese troops dug in along the coastline and in the jungle. Construction of a large airstrip starts immediately to give Allied planes a base from which they can pound Japan's southern positions. &lt;br&gt;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:09:47</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
