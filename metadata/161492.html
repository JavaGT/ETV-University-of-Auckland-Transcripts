In June 1964, hundreds of college students travelled to Mississippi, starting Freedom Summer. That same month, two groups of young musicians and students also travelled to Mississippi. Though neither group were aware of the other, both were on the same errand: to find two blues legends and coax them out of retirement. Thirty years before, Son House and Skip James had recorded some of the most memorable music of their era but now they seemed lost to time.

There were few clues to their whereabouts but it was not even known if they were still alive. Mississippi, that summer was a tense and violent place.
