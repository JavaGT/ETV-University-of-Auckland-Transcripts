While Europe was indeed having some issues, many other parts of the world were thriving and relatively enlightened. John covers European Feudalism, the cultural blossoming of the Islamic world, and the scientific and artistic advances in China, all during these &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. Along the way, John will raise questions about the validity of Europe's status as a continent.
