Many older Australians are dependent on the care and support of informal care arrangements provided by the family and formal aged care services delivered in the community or in residential aged care homes. 

Developing and maintaining respectful interpersonal relationships with the client/resident and family through the use of effective and specialist communication skills can achieve successful outcomes of care that promote quality of life in accordance with legislation, regulatory requirements, professional standards and guidelines. This program discusses various methods and approaches carers can utilise when communicating, ensuring a successful care arrangement for everyone involved.
