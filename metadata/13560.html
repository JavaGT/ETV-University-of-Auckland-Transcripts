Where do we go when we die? What happens to the soul on its final journey? Because the Bible offers little detail about either Heaven or Hell, Christian artists and writers have filled in the gaps. In this episode of Decoding Christianity, host Christy Kenneally reveals how the idea of the afterlife has evolved through the centuries. He investigates the Christian concept of Original Sin, explains where the notions of Limbo and Purgatory &ndash; neither of which appears in the Bible &ndash; came from, and contemplates the powerful hold that visions of Hell and the Last Judgment have had upon the artistic imagination.

'Decoding Christianity' offers a compelling insight into both the artistic and the spiritual, uniting two aspects of human endeavour that have become increasingly separated in the modern world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion & Theology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-04-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>02:30:00</td></tr></table>
