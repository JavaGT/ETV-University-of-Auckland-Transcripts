But in fact control systems have existed ever since people started to develop and use tools. Today, as technology becomes progressively more complex and an intrinsic part of our modern work and life, we are increasingly reliant on computer controlled technology to extend human capabilities. This excellent program introduces computer controlled systems, block diagrams, open and closed loop systems, microprocessors, and sensors and actuators. In it we examine EFTPOS machines, robots, manufacturing and product control, multimedia entertainment and education and medical applications.
