Several months after the disastrous Nutcracker performance, the studio is closed and everyone has scattered to the winds. No one is dancing except Michelle in a dreary magician's show on the outskirts of Las Vegas while she camps out on Talia's couch. The girls, meanwhile, deal with the chaos of their lives, and Sasha's return from Joffrey creates more when she refuses to go back home.

'Bunheads' is the tale of Michelle Simms, a former ballerina 'bunhead' who wound up as a Las Vegas showgirl. Seeing her life and career at a dead end, she impulsively takes up the offer of marriage from her persistent admirer, Hubbell Flowers (played by Alan Ruck), and moves to his sleepy coastal town, the fictional town of Paradise in Southern California, thirty miles south of Ojai, California.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:58:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Dance, Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-05-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:00:00</td></tr></table>
