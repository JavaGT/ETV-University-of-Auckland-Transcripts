He's a descendant of Ngai Te Rangi, Nga Potiki and Ngati Ranginui, and he's also the newest 'Australian Idol'. Months of hard work and commitment finally paid off for Stan, and it wasn't going to be easy for a Kiwi to win the hearts and minds of Australian fans.
Reporter Karley Hemopo was in Sydney with Stan and his whanau to witness the immediate 24-hour build up to the unforgettable finale. However, come post-finals, it proved a challenge to get even a 5 minute audience with the 'golden boy' with the 'golden voice'. 
Is this small town boy ready for the world?  Or should the question be, is the world ready for Stan Walker. Aurere: Joining Shane in studio is Labour leader Phil Goff to explain what his nationhood speech in Palmerston North on Thursday was all about. Live Cross: Live cross with Te Karere reporter Tina Whitcliff to discuss the latest in the Hone Harawira saga.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Magazine</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-11-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:00:00</td></tr></table>
