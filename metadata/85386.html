Radar marvels at ancient statues and learns how and why these world famous monoliths were formed. He witnesses the Tapati festival, which shows off the island's ancient crafts and odd competitions.

Te Radar lives in the world's biggest Polynesian city &ndash; Auckland. But he doesn't know much about his Pacific neighbours. In this series, Radar Across the Pacific, he travels to the islands to find out more. He explores his connections with these countries and goes well beyond the tourist brochures to uncover and explore not only the challenges these small nations are facing, but also to investigate what their cultures are all about.

In a bit of an 'off the beaten track' adventure, Te Radar travels to Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands and Kiribati to visit NZ ex-pats, local families, village elders, chiefs, politicians and officials as he seeks to get to the heart of what life is like in each country.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Economics, Geography, History, New Zealand, Pacifica, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-07-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
