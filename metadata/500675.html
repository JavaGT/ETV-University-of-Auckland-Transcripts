This film follows the FreeSwim journey of wahine (woman) Ally Davey as she takes on 70km of open ocean around the stunning Coromandel coastline over three days to bring awareness to the protection of New Zealand&rsquo;s oceans. 

It does more than encapsulate stunning vistas and highlight the extraordinary New Zealand environment, but inspires people to be aware of the natural beauty that surrounds them and to protect it before it is too late. It&rsquo;s an inspirational film, not an activist film. It highlights the wonder of exploration and the intrinsic benefits of getting wet and looking below the surface, championing endurance of the human spirit. 

Moana Waiwai translates to Big Ocean, filmed in February and March of 2020 in the remote Northern Coromandel Peninsula of New Zealand&rsquo;s North Island.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:22:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, English, Geography, Health, Maori, Media Studies, Natural History, New Zealand, Physical Education, Social Studies, Sport, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-02-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>15:24:31</td></tr></table>
