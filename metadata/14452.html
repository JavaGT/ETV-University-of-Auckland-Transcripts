Reporting suicide is a legal minefield for journalists and editors and the ethical problems are also complex. Mental Health professionals warn of the dangers of copy-cat behavior and the grief of the survivors must be handled with great tact and discretion when suicides are reported. The end result is that a certain degree of censorship is at work. Can the media help prevent this tragic toll or will its reports always make the problem worse? Media7 has convened a panel of Clive Lind - Editorial Development Manager of Fairfax NZ; Nettie Cullen - Psychotherapist and AUT Lecturer and Merryn Statham - Director of SPINZ (Suicide Prevention Information New Zealand)  to discuss this issue. Also joining Russell Brown this week will be Alex Swyny (Heart of the City), Alistair Kwun (Organizer of the Bananas Conference) and Ana Samways (freelance columnist for the NZ Herald) who will be looking at the $1.8 million campaign to sell Auckland as an exciting &quot;Big&quot; Little City.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ7</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-05-29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:10:00</td></tr></table>
