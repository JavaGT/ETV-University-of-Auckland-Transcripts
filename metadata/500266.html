At Woburn Railway Workshops, rails are welded into lengths of 351 feet ready for prefabrication at Mangaroa into complete track unit. The units are carried by rail into the Rimutaka Tunnel and laid with the help of mobile gantries. In other locations, we see machines engaged in track laying and ballasting and, in Dunedin's workshops, the spectacular melting of steel, the making of castings and the building of large steam engines. Also shown are the last of the Fell engines' trips over the Rimutaka Incline, the opening of the new tunnel, and the changing over from steam to diesel, diesel-electric, and electric locomotives.
