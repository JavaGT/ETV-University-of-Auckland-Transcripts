The artist reinterpreting this Kiwi song is a local legend in Ghana - Wanlov The Kubolor. Wanlov's music is part rap, part reggae and all fun. He adapts not only the song, but also the meaning of the song; using it as an opportunity to talk about the state of the rivers in Ghana. While Wanlov puts the finishing touches on 'Bathe In The River', Nick meets a man who some say was the first to rap on a commercial hit: Geydu Blay Ambolley. Nick also meets local music legend Reggie Rockstone, plays some New Zealand music videos on Ghanian national television, and even finds time for some very silly shopping. To conclude the episode, we see what Holly Smith and Don McGlashan think of the Ghanian reworking of their song.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:34:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOUR</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-12-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:58:00</td></tr></table>
