A driver so drunk she shouldnt be standing let alone driving; a lying passenger gets his comeuppance; and wild winds threaten to shut down a motorbike rally.

New Zealand's highways include 11,000 kilometres of some of the most spectacular and unforgiving roads on the planet. More than 250 men and women are tasked with keeping our highways and byways safe. It's a job that brings its own perils and rewards. 

In Highway Cops, we follow members of the Highway Patrol out of the city and into the rural heartland - the Central North Island, the Tasman region and the deep South. 

The Tasman Highway Patrol is based in Nelson but covers a vast beat - 70,000 square kilometres. From the glaciers of South Westland to the isolated bays of the Marlborough Sounds, the district is a mecca for tourists from all over the world - some driving too fast, some too slow and some on the wrong side of the road. 

The Central Districts team cover more than 1360 kilometres of highway, including a big swathe of the mighty State Highway 1, slicing down the backbone of the lower North Island, from the volcanic plateau, south to Otaki. From the trauma of a serious crash - to the perils of rescuing a stranded cow, they'll tackle any challenge. 

Southern District Highway Patrol cover nearly a quarter of New Zealand: south to Stewart Island, north to Oamaru and west to Haast, including some of the most rugged roads in the country. 

The Southern beat includes Wanaka and Queenstown, party towns where the population doubles over summer. Language barriers and bumptious locals are just some of the challenges faced by the Highway Patrol in these scenic hotspots.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:06</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-08-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
