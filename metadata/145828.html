About the Series:
Waka Huia is an award winning iconic te reo M훮ori archival documentary series. Waka Huia celebrates stories from throughout the M훮ori world. Each programme is subtitled to allow more viewers to enjoy and appreciate our stories.

Since its first transmission in 1987, Waka Huia has captured for all time, the faces and voices of many kaum훮tua who are no longer with us. In the process we have created a vital and important audio-visual archive of Iwi and Hap큰 life and history.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:44</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Maori, Media Studies, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-09-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:30:00</td></tr></table>
