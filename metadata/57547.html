Often one or more of the senses are affected -- particularly vision and hearing. For some, mobility and the range of physical movements decline, and aids for walking and other movement may become necessary. Mental health can also decline in some people as they age.
This program explores a range of areas relating to caring for frail and immobile people. Its thrust is largely about encouraging older people to use their existing capacities to the maximum extent, in order to remain as physically and mentally active as possible. Areas examined in the program include ageing gracefully, the physiological changes that occur with ageing, common pathologies relating to older people, and creating a physical activity program. Expert comments from Professor Peter Hunter, Director of Aged Care and Rehabilitation with Alfred Health and Caulfield Hospital, appear throughout the program.
This program is an excellent learning resource for students undertaking certificated or degree courses in areas such as aged care and nursing. It also serves as a useful professional development resource for health professionals working in any areas that involve interaction with, or care for, older people.
