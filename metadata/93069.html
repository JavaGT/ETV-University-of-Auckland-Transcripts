The three finalists compete in three tough challenges set by Savile Row's Patrick Grant and sewing expert May Martin who must decide who will take the title of Britain's best amateur sewer. The first test is to follow a pattern for a man's shirt. The judges are looking for perfect top stitching with no pleats or puckers but the complicated challenge drives one sewer to tears. In the second challenge they have to show off their hand sewing skills, decorating an evening bag, and for the finale they are asked to create the most demanding garment so far - a stunning made-to-measure evening dress in a luxury fabric. The finalists are in for a surprise when they see who their models are.
