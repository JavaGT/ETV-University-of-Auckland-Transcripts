&quot;Controversial&quot; historian Professor Niall Ferguson concludes the series by challenging the received wisdom that the fall of the Berlin Wall represented ultimate triumph for Western values, pointing to racial conflict in the last decades of the 20th century. He also considers the possibility of a further global war in the future. 

'War of the World'. &quot;Controversial&quot; historian Professor Niall Ferguson argues that in the last century there were not in fact two World Wars and a Cold War, but a single Hundred Years' War. It was not nationalism that powered the conflicts of the century, but empires. It was not ideologies of class or the advent of socialism driving the century, but race. Ultimately, ethnic conflict underpinned 20th-century violence. Finally, it was not the West that triumphed as the century progressed - in fact, power slowly and steadily migrated towards the new empires of the East.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Economics, Geography, History, Political Studies, Religion & Theology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:30:00</td></tr></table>
