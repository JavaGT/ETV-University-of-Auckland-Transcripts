Ray shows how to wring water from these barren lands and how travelling light is the key to success on such an epic journey.

Ray Mears journeys through the wilderness of the Australian outback to learn about the people, the wildlife, and the culture. He is joined by Australian survival experts who enrich his journey and deepen Mears's understanding of Australian bushcraft. These journeys encompass many of the themes of Mears's world discovery: the natural world, indigenous culture, adventure and survival.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:53</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Geography, Physical Education</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-05-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
