Turks go to the polls on Sunday to choose mayors and local government officials.
Municipal elections are being held in Turkey on Sunday, and the vote could define the future of Turkish politics.
Polls will be open in all 81 provinces, but the real battle is for a city of 16 million people, the only city on two continents &ndash; Istanbul.

There is a saying in Turkish politics: Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey. And that is why this vote is a test for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&rsquo;s AK Party. It lost Istanbul to the opposition five years ago.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, History, Leadership, Media Studies, News, Political Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-04-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:30:00</td></tr></table>
