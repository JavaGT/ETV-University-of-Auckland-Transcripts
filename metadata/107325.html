Each week seasoned investigative journalist David Lomas, along with a specialist search team of genealogists and researchers, tackles the cases of up to three seekers who are on an emotional journey to discover their family members and cultural pasts that they have not been connected to.
Lost &amp; Found is real, raw and - at times - heartbreaking as each episode showcases a basic primal need &ndash; just how important it is to know who we are and where we&rsquo;ve come from. Tissues advised.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:33</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-06-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
