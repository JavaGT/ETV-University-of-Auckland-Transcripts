From the 'Seven Sharp' website:
Our goal is to keep you informed, discuss what you're discussing but never take ourselves too seriously. We want to celebrate being Kiwi, and not just have a doom and gloom look at the world. This country is brimming with talent and characters and we want to find the stories around them. You never know what could happen on a day in news, and that's what we are going to reflect day to day.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:32:17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, Media Studies, New Zealand, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-07-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
