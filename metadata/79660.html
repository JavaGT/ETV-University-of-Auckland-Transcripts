Mary's half-brother James Stewart, Earl of Moray (Joe Doyle) arrives to tell her that the Scots are chafing under Marie de Guise's rule and advises her to return to Scotland. Mary wants to go immediately but Francis is reluctant. Francis discovers James' footman was paid by the English to kill Mary during her voyage so that James can be king. When Mary still insists on going, Francis locks her in the tower. Catherine and Kenna work together, staging an intervention where a fake &quot;Bishop&quot; condemns Henry's sexual activities and scares Henry into humility and dismissing Penelope. When this succeeds, Catherine gives Penelope's estate and jewels to Kenna and Bash, who celebrate with a kiss. Lola and Julien are married, but Lola starts to suspect that Julien has financial difficulties. Nostradamus and Olivia have started a romantic relationship, but when Nostradamus has a vision of Olivia's death, he sends her away to Trinidad alone, knowing that Catherine will never let him go.
