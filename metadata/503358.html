Kabuga co-founded and funded Rwanda&rsquo;s infamous radio station RTLM, which played a key role in the country&rsquo;s genocide.

After 26 years on the run, Felicien Kabuga &ndash; the man accused of being one of the key figures behind Rwanda&rsquo;s genocide &ndash; was arrested in Paris on May 16, 2020. A French court has ruled that he will be sent to Arusha, Tanzania to be tried in the United Nations&rsquo; International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. He has been indicted on two counts of crimes against humanity and seven counts of genocide, including &ldquo;the direct and public incitement to commit genocide&rdquo;. That count relates to his part in setting up and funding Radio Mille Collines, or RTLM, Rwanda&rsquo;s infamous radio station that played a key role in the genocide.

RTLM started broadcasting in August 1993. As president of the station, Kabuga oversaw RTLM&rsquo;s editorial agenda &ndash; an agenda that, from the outset, called for Rwanda&rsquo;s majority Hutu population to &ldquo;exterminate&rdquo; the minority Tutsis.

F&eacute;licien Kabuga financed the hate media of Rwanda&rsquo;s genocide. This is the story of the role he played in the killing and how he evaded justice for 26 years.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:26:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-08-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:30:00</td></tr></table>
