Each episode has the same structure. At the beginning of the episode, some of the Numberjacks will be engaged in an activity that will have relevance to the problem that is later discovered. Then an &quot;agent&quot; (a live-action child) will call in and describe the problem that is occurring. One or two of the Numberjacks will go out into the real world to solve the problem, while the remaining Numberjacks stay in their base and watch their progress on a screen. As soon as the problem is understood, Numberjack 5 imagines what else could go wrong if it wasn't solved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once outside, the Numberjacks are shown in a live-action setting (although themselves still animated). They diagnose the problem by examination and with help from additional ideas from the agents, who call into the base. The problem could be caused by an antagonist or a younger Numberjack escaping from the sofa and inadvertently making things go wrong. Problems are solved by using &quot;Brain Gain,&quot; a magical force of power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once solved, the Numberjacks return to their base, replay what happened on a screen and then challenge the viewer to think about a related problem and to &quot;call the Numberjacks.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problems encountered are all based around simple mathematical concepts and the programme is intended to stimulate young children's interest in mathematics. On satellite, digital and cable tv, a link to Numberjacks often appears on a corner of screen. This link sometimes appears on for example, gardening programs as a way of helping people with basic numeracy.&lt;br&gt;[edit]</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:15:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Mathematics</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ7</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-09-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>07:05:00</td></tr></table>
