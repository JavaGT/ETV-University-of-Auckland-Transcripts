About series:
After serving as a British Army nurse in World War II, Claire Randall is enjoying a second honeymoon in Scotland with husband Frank, an MI6 officer looking forward to a new career as an Oxford historian. Suddenly, Claire is transported to 1743 and into a mysterious world where her freedom and life are threatened. To survive, she marries Jamie Fraser, a strapping Scots warrior with a complicated past and a disarming sense of humour. A passionate relationship ensues, and Claire is caught between two vastly different men in two inharmonious lives. `Outlander' is adapted from the best-selling books by Diana Gabaldon.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:10:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>English, History, Literature, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-03-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
