Tiama, a 15-metre yacht purpose-built for Antarctic conditions. The expedition, organised by the Ministry of Fisheries, has gathered information to support a New Zealand proposal for additional marine protection around the islands which lie on the outer reaches of the Ross Sea, where the Antarctic waters meet the Southern Ocean. The Ballenys are the only archipelago at that latitude for thousands of kilometres, and scientists believe that the local marine environment may be important to the health of the entire Ross Sea ecosystem. The Balleny Islands isolation and local conditions means research there has never been easy. The islands are surrounded by ice for up to 11 months of the year and several of the islands rise nearly 1000 metres from the sea. The near-shore waters are largely uncharted and anchorages are difficult. By using a yacht with a strengthened hull and removable keel, the team were able to safely access the shallows to film the sealife there. The expedition was the first to put divers into the waters around the Ballenys and remarkable footage from these dives is included in this HotScience story.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:10:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-09-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>14:04:11</td></tr></table>
