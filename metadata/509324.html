A talented artist, brave survivor of child abuse, adamant defender of human rights and determined battler of addiction, Leigh Conkie first invited filmmaker Ryan Gaskett to begin recording and investigating the deepest and most intimate details of his remarkable life in 2012. Filmed over the space of 5 years, the documentary paints the portrait of a beloved local icon with intimate footage of his daily routine, his captivating practice, his fight for justice against his abuser, and interviews with the network of friends, family and supporters who surround him.

In following Leigh&rsquo;s journey through abuse, alcoholism, drug-addiction, and art, Leigh is at once a witness to human endurance, a challenge to the surface judgements we make about each other, and an examination of everything that could lead any of us down a path of self-destruction, or self-betterment.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:39:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Media Studies, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-04-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
