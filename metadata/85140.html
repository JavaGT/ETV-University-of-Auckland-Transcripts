Even the large number of 1080 poison baits he placed in a small stream did not kill fish or invertebrates. In another experiment he showed that freshwater crayfish will eat the baits but the tiny amount of poison they ingest is excreted easily in a couple of days and does not accumulate in their bodies. Alastair works for the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). The research he describes in this clip was funded by the Animal Health Board (AHB).
