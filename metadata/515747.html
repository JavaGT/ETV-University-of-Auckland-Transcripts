Dr Bloomfield looked shocked when asked about the comments by a reporter at today's briefing.

He then turned to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern saying &quot;I'm not going to comment on that Prime Minister&quot;.

&quot;No, we will let your silence speak for itself,&quot; Ms Ardern replied.

Dr Bloomfield later responded with some advice when pressed by a journalist, who pointed out some people in the US have made themselves sick by ingesting disinfectants after Mr Trump's address.

&quot;Under no circumstances should they think about doing that,&quot; he said to any Kiwis who had heard Mr Trump's statement.

Disinfectant manufacturers in the US on Saturday also warned people not to follow President Trump&rsquo;s advice.

While Mr Trump himself attempted to explain away his controversial remarks around injecting disinfectant into the body in a bid to eradicate Covid-19.

&quot;I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,&quot; he told reporters at a recent Bill signing.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:01:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Online platforms</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-11-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:53:00</td></tr></table>
