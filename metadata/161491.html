About series:
Redemption comes with a heavy price.

The genre-busting Arctic epic series returns with one final chilling visit. Featuring an all-star cast of returning favourites and brand new characters, we return to Fortitude at the start of Season 3 with the death of Governor Munk continuing to hang over the town, as the inhabitants of the most staggeringly beautiful place on earth begin to piece their lives back together after the horrors of Season 2. But there are new horrors festering in Fortitude and the town&rsquo;s Sheriff, Dan Anderssen, will find himself at the heart of them.
