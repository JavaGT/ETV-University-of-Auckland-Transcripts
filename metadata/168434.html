He explores the space as if lost in a labyrinth. Time has deteriorated the floors, water is dripping through the ceiling and nature is taking over each room. The windows are shut, dust has accumulated, the walls are full of holes... everything testifies of the passage of time. Apart from the sound of drops falling at a distance, the silence is complete.

This exploration is interrupted when, in the middle of a vast room, the man discovers a piano covered under a sheet. The instrument is an object of reminiscence on which the last Beethoven sonatas will be performed, while the camera continues to wander through the rooms. Slow travelling shots dwell on the textures, the details of the objects left behind, playing with shadows and light.

Beethoven&rsquo;s last three sonatas &ndash; Opus 109, 110 and 111 &ndash; explore the intimate meanders of the human soul, from despair to transfiguration. At the time of their composition, Beethoven was already locked in himself by his deafness. This deeply affected his relationship to others and to the world.

This psychological framework is explored by director Mariano Nante, setting pianist Alexandre Tharaud in a film inspired by the universe of Tarkovski. Filmed in abandoned castles, and lit by director of photography Yorgos Arvanitis, this work evokes solitude and introspection and offers an inner journey through images and music.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:04:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Music</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-09-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
