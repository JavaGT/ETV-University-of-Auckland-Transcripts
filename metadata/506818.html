After a year where countries in Africa faced the impact of climate change, navigated political and social challenges, and celebrated sporting achievements, people across the continent are now looking ahead to the new year.

In this episode of The Stream, we&rsquo;ll look at three stories in Africa that will be headline news in 2023.

Nigeria decides
Africa&rsquo;s most populous country is preparing to hold a general election in February that will decide who succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari at the end of his second and final term.

Bola Tinubu, the nominee of the ruling All Progressives Congress, is expected to face a strong challenge from People&rsquo;s Democratic Party nominee Atiku Abubakar, who lost to Buhari in the 2019 election. Peter Obi of the Labour Party is also expected to be firmly in the running.

Eligible voters across the country of 211 million people will also choose members of the Senate and House of Representatives in the election. But as economic and security issues weigh on the minds of the electorate, there are concerns that recent attacks on election commission offices could undermine the free and fair running of the landmark vote.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-12-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
