Kevin McCloud meets a pair of civil-partnered university professors who have decided to build their first home from scratch. In addition to all the complications this usually entails, Celia Brackenridge and Diana Woodward have also enlisted the services of industrial designers who have developed a new computer-assisted method for cutting precision-engineered building blocks from scratch. However, though the technique may be clever, its creators have never created a building before - meaning everyone involved with the project is taking a giant leap into the unknown.

Grand Designs is a British television series produced by Talkback Thames and broadcast on Channel 4 which features unusual and often elaborate architectural homebuilding projects. The programme has been presented by Kevin McCloud since it first aired in April 1999.

All episodes generally follow a regular format, with small variations depending on the progress of the build. At the beginning of an episode, McCloud meets the clients embarking on the project; he visits the site with them, and discusses the plans for the building. A computer visualisation or computer-aided design view of the intended project is shown.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:01:59</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Design</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THREE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-02-14</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
