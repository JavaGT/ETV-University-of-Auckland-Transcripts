Inspired by a true story, Scorpion is a high-octane drama about eccentric genius Walter O&rsquo;Brien and his team of brilliant misfits who comprise the last line of defense against complex, high-tech threats of the modern age.

As Homeland Security&rsquo;s new think tank, O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scorpion&rdquo; team includes Toby Curtis, an expert behaviorist who can read anyone; Happy Quinn, a mechanical prodigy; and Sylvester Dodd, a statistics guru.

Pooling their extensive technological knowledge to solve mind-boggling predicaments amazes federal agent Cabe Gallo, who shares a harrowing history with O&rsquo;Brien.

However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with each other&rsquo;s humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them, so they rely on Paige Dineen, who has a young, gifted son, to translate the world for them.

At last, these nerdy masterminds have found the perfect job: a place where they can apply their exceptional brainpower to solve the nation&rsquo;s crises, while also helping each other learn how to fit in.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:47:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Drama, Information Technology, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Sociology, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-04-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
