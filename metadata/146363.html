About series:
Watching us from space, satellites orbit the Earth at 27,000 kilometres an hour, capturing images of our world that are breathtaking, but in some instances, bizarre. This unique perspective reveals objects that seem to make no sense, and phenomena that defy explanation. New episodes track a strange image that might just lead researchers to the legendary city of El Dorado, and uncover evidence that could reveal the remains of an ancient Roman city thought to be lost forever. What on Earth? analyses these sites on the ground in search of answers; attempting to unravel these mysteries, and more.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-09-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:25:00</td></tr></table>
