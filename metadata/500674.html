Background
While the Government has a real-world impact on our daily lives, there has been a general decline in the number of people deciding who represents us in Parliament. At the 2017 General Election, around a third of 18-23 year olds were not enrolled, and of those who were, around a third did not cast a vote. 88% of people over 65 voted.

Research tells us there are a number of reasons people aren&rsquo;t involved with politics, particularly youth. These include:
* a lack of information about political parties and what they stand for
* a lack of understanding of the Government&rsquo;s importance and relevance.

On the Fence was created to lower these barriers, and support young New Zealanders to become voters. It is a gameful questionnaire that guides people towards finding their best match amongst the parties standing in the General Election. It provides information about these parties and their values, explains what the Government does and raises awareness of the election in general. Importantly, we want On the Fence to spark conversations about politics with friends and family.

Why should I care?
The Government has a real impact on your everyday life. It shapes your country&rsquo;s present and future. Voting in the General Election is a powerful way for you to influence who is responsible for making decisions about the services and issues that matter most to you. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to have your say!

Where is the data from?
All political parties that met our inclusion criteria were asked to respond to the same questions as users. These responses form the algorithm that underpins the questionnaire and is what On the Fence uses to compare and measure party compatibility with users of the tool.

Who is involved?
Our criteria for party inclusion in On the Fence 2020 is:

Parties must be registered with the Electoral Commission and currently in Parliament or polling at 0.5% at the beginning of August 2020, the time parties were invited to participate. All parties that met our criteria provided written consent and their own answers to the questionnaire.

How were the questions formed?
The questions have been designed by Massey University&rsquo;s Design Democracy Project alongside rangatahi from across Aotearoa, RNZ, Generation Zero and Platform Charitable Trust.
