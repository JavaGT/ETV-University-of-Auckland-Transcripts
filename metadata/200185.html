Their hearts are broken, as the nation itself is ripped down the middle over the most noble of ideals: that all human beings are created equal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to the tour, New Zealand had pursued a reciprocal sporting relationship with South Africa, inviting Springbok rugby teams to tour and sending All Black teams to the Republic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the boycott by 28 countries of the Montreal Olympics in 1976 brought home to Kiwis the brutality and injustice of South Africa's apartheid regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It came as a shock to many then, when the New Zealand Rugby Union announced it had officially invited the Springboks to tour New Zealand in the winter of 1981.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At that moment, the anti-tour protest movement was born, and white South Africa's pride and joy landed in New Zealand to spend 56 days under siege, as the normally demure little nation at the bottom of the world came close to civil war in protest over their presence.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:59:15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Movie</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, English, History, Media Studies, New Zealand, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-09-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:30:00</td></tr></table>
