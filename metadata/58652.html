Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the Jazz Age, 'The Great Gatsby'. John introduces you to Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby, Daisy and Tom Buchanan, and the other characters in the novel, and tries to look beyond the surface story to figure out what this novel is about. Set in the 1920s against a conflicted backdrop of prohibition and excess, 'The Great Gatsby' takes a close look at the 'American Dream' as it existed in Fitzgerald's time. It turns out, it had a lot to do with money and status, and it still does today. John will cover the rich symbolism of the novel, from the distant green light to the pale gold of wealth and decay.
