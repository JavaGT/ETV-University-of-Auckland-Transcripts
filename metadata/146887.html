About series:
Looking at baby animals in our world.
Animals play such a big role in our lives. We love them so much! In this second series we take a broad range of baby animals and showcase them in our homes, our zoos, our farms, our stations - in our world. We follow them in these familiar environments and highlight their behaviors and milestones including birthing (where appropriate), first hours, feeding, nurturing, grooming, play, napping, romping, exploring and learning with mum and dad. Featuring lingering/close up shots intermixed with fast paced action sequences we see how each baby animal settles into the unique world we live in.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:36</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-10-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:00:00</td></tr></table>
