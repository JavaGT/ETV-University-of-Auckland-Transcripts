In this episode we focus on an historical figure that defied British authority and felled the flagstaff in Kororareka during the 18oo's.  The Taiaha attributed to Heke that is in the Auckland museum provides an opportunity to focus on a man who looms large in NZ history.

An historical series and the first ever co-production with the Auckland War Memorial Museum.  In the first episode we look at the story of a mere pounamu with many namesakes, Te Kaoreore. The name Kaoreore seems to have been a popular one throughout history and the particular one that is the focus of this episode has a dramatic history. This episode features interviews with Mauriora Kingi and Rawiri Rangitauira as they explain the origins of two of the kaoreore mere prominent in Te Arawa history. There is also a re-enactment of the Hatupatu and Raumati story and the story of how Tama Ahua found the greenstone block giving rise to the name Kaoreore. The 100 percent Maori language show explores the past of 13 taonga housed in the Maori court of the Auckland War Memorial Museum, giving a unique insight into the lives of ancestors they represent. Each episode is devoted to an item from the collection and will feature dramatic re-enactments of the events and people behind the taonga. Presented by Tihini Grant (Te Arawa, Ngati Pikiao), Tamaki Paenga Hira uncovers the past, present and future of each piece and the role the museum plays in preserving the mauri of the taonga for generations to come.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, History, Maori, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-01-04</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
