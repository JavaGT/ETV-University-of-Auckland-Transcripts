Scott Wilson and Ellis Emmett visit South Africa to face their fears and brave some of the most notorious shark-filled waters in the world. Disaster strikes on what should have been an easy shipwreck dive.

Descending to the depths of our oceans is where real adventure begins. No matter how tall the highest peak, how vast the broadest desert or how inhospitable the polar caps - it's all insignificant compared to what lies beneath the waves. Descending captures the thrilling adventures of Scott Wilson, Ellis Emmett and cinematographer Andre Dupuis as they journey into the depths of our world to see places and creatures few of us ever will. Nearly three quarters of our planet is water but the team set out to not just dive our oceans, lakes and rivers, but to discover the stories of human triumph and tragedy associated with the water, and assess with their own eyes the health of the unseen depths. Their own adventure becomes a mirror image of what they are searching for, with triumph and near tragedy always close at hand. An aquatic adventure series on an epic scale, 'Descending' pushes the boundaries of underwater film-making to capture some of the most incredible underwater footage ever seen.
