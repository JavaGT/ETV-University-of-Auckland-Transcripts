Production of antivenin has taken a back seat in this war-torn country, and, as a result, more than 1,200 of its people are dying each year from snakebites. Donald's mission is a dangerous but lifesaving one: capture three of Sri Lanka's deadliest snakes - the spectacled cobra, the krait and the russell's viper - and milk their venom so researchers can create antivenin. Donald then treks into the lowland forest in search of one of his favorite animals, a slender loris, a tiny primate with a bizarre toxic defense. Before his Sri Lanka mission is complete, Donald joins forces with dozens of men to find and relocate a rampaging rogue elephant that's terrorizing local villagers.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Natural History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ANIMAL PLANET</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-12-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:29:00</td></tr></table>
