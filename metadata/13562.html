But what happens when this most essential rhythm of life goes awry? Even with modern medical advances, arrhythmias lead to 300,000 cardiac-caused deaths in America each year. Kevin Oill, an 18-year old college freshman in New York State suddenly collapses while watching TV with friends. Miraculously, his buddies save his life using CPR and a portable defibrillator. Tests reveal Kevin, his mother and two teenage brothers have a genetic condition called Long QT Syndrome that kills without warning. Now they must weigh the benefits and risks of getting internal defibrillators that will be with them for the rest of their lives. Electrical engineer and mother of three boys, 42 year old Susan Arvin?s heart keeps losing its rhythm, beating too fast and too inefficiently. Her active personality won?t let her slow down so doctors must perform an innovative, high-tech procedure to thread numerous wires up into her heart and kill the renegade cells with intense radio waves. Then, former Brazilian cowboy Magdal Gonzaga da Silva, now in his 50s, has Chagas disease. Caused by a parasite entering the bloodstream and attacking the heart muscle, it means he could go into ventricular fibrillation and die within minutes. The best doctors can do for him is implant a pacemaker to speed his heart up when it beats too slowly and shock it back to slower speeds when it beats too fast, but he will always be waiting for the next attack.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-04-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>04:30:00</td></tr></table>
