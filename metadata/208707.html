Somewhere between MI5, MI6 and the malfunctioning third-floor printer at the U.K.'s labyrinthine Government Communications Headquarters, an arrogant, maverick NSA liaison arrives from the U.S. to join a ragtag bureaucracy of cybersecurity misfits. With all the swagger of John Wayne and none of the substance, the Yankee liaison enlists the help of a junior systems analyst in a workplace power grab. It's a move that threatens to upend the team's directives -- if only it weren't miraculously, possibly completely coincidentally, leading to actual crisis aversion. From a cat lady and former Nobel Prize nominee with a graying head of witch-like hair to a notorious hacker whose first pet was a wolf named Wolf, the unpolished experts at GCHQ thrive under Jerry's assumed authority while nerding out over dinosaur pencil toppers and cryptocurrency.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:22:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-07-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
