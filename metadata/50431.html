This week on Neighbourhood comedian Tarun Mohanbhai gives us a very special insight into Pakuranga, the Auckland suburb in which he grew up and where he still lives.

We visit Marhaba, a playgroup re-inventing the way pre-school Muslim children are being taught, find out how a local Chinese artsit is seeking inpsiration in unexpected places, and we hear the incredibly moving story of the Polish orphans who came to New Zealand during World War 2 and see a special momento of their historic train journey across the North Island. Plus we pay a mouth-watering visit  to Pakuranga's  extraordinary Night Market.

Curator Bio
Tarun Mohanbhai

Tarun (aka &quot;That Indian Guy&quot;) was born in 1972. His family migrated to NZ in the 1940's. Brought up in white suburban Pakuranga, Tarun was a bit of a funny bloke in the playground which eventually evolved into a career in standup comedy.

His routine runs the gambit from astute and insightful material about being Indian and living outside of India, to Bollywood style song and dance routines.

Neighbourhood is a television series that explores and celebrates New Zealand's cultural diversity in a fresh and engaging way. This series aims to take the viewer on a personal and eclectic journey of New Zealand's cultural landscape through the eyes of the diverse ethnic minorities that live here. 
Every week the episode is based in a different neighbourhood and explores four strands that look at creativity, food, politics, and treasure from a cultural perspective unique to that neighbourhood. Breaking out of the traditional presenter role, and to reflect New Zealand's diversity, Neighbourhood is being curated by a different, well known, New Zealander each week who has a special tie with the area and their own unique cultural story to tell.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>11:00:00</td></tr></table>
