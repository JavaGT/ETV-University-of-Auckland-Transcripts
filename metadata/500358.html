The key differences which can be exploited are generally described by referring to their coherence which is much greater than that of other sources. This involves both spatial coherence and temporal coherence. Spatial coherence refers to the effect whereby the laser beam behaves as if it came from a point source, while conventional sources are &quot;spread out&quot; in space, consequently laser beams can be focussed into extremely small areas. Temporal coherence refers to the fact that laser beams have a very narrow spectral width-loosely speaking only one colour is present. &lt;br&gt; 
This video describes a number of applications of lasers including laser induced fluorescence work in the Physics Department (the French agent Alain Marfart's print was detected on a chart taken from the yacht &quot;Ouvea&quot; which brought the Rainbow Warrior bombers to Auckland in 1985 - this was the first use of laser fingerprint detection in New Zealand). This work uses a &quot;light pipe&quot; to convey the light to the sample, other applications of optical fibres include ultra high speed communications systems research, and the spinoff company from the University which this research has generated. &lt;br&gt; Featuring John Harvey, Professor of Physics at the University of Auckland and Doug Reid,  a Phd Student physics studying high speed laser pulses.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:04:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2007-07-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
