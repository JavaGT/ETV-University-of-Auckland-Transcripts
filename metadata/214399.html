Herself a visual artist, director Sookoon Ang is interested in what happens behind the scenes in artists&rsquo; lives and the sacrifices that some choose to make to experience their art. Speaking freely and truthfully, the artists interviewed frankly discuss the financial considerations linked to art, the periods of economic struggle that they have undergone, and the role of the artist in society. These captivating encounters take us from New York to Japan, via Berlin and Amsterdam.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:41</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary, Interview</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Anthropology, Art, Business, Careers, Design, Economics, History, Media Studies, Social Studies, Sociology, Vocational</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-09-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
