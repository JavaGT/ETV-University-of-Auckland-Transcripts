This loyal local is also a very astute businessman with a string of hardware stores to his name. His biggest claim to fame, however, is his management of a major fire-fighting operation when the local Fonterra dairy factory caught fire. After the blaze it was touch and go whether Fonterra would re-build or move the processing operation elsewhere. But as Woolf and his team had saved a key milk powder tower which formed the heart of the operation, Fonterra decided to rebuild retaining hundreds of jobs in the remote settlement.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-07-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
