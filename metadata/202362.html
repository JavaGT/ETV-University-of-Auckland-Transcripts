 No Offence', written by Paul Abbott, is an extraordinary police procedural series starring Joanna Scanlan, Elaine Cassidy and Alexandra Roach. A team of cops, based in a criminal-ridden part of town, work together to keep the streets safe. Their commitment and strong work ethic has seen them put away arsonists, neo-Nazis, drug lords and notorious murderers. Nothing seems to deter this force until they begin work on a serial killer case, which leaves everyone in fear for their lives. Led by DI Vivienne Deering, the unorthodox group set off from their crumbling station to investigate the unusual goings on.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:55:08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-03-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
