Holmes and Watson investigate a child abduction case which involves a serial killer known as the &quot;Balloon Man&quot;, whose name comes from the fact that balloons are left at each of his crime scenes. Matters get complicated when the Balloon Man's first victim from 2005, Adam Kemper (Johnny Simmons) is caught by the police - Holmes deduces that Adam has Stockholm Syndrome, and sympathizes with him to help find the killer. The Balloon Man is identified as Samuel Abbott, but Abbott commits suicide, allowing for the release of his most recent victim. Holmes investigates Abbott's home and finds evidence leading to his realization that Adam is in fact the Balloon Man. Following a brief confrontation with Holmes, Adam gets an immunity deal clearing him from all charges on crimes committed &quot;in consort with Samuel Abbott aka the Balloon Man&quot;, but Holmes is able to arrange for Adam's arrest when he determines that one of the crimes had to have been committed by Adam alone as Abbott was in hospital when the abduction occurred.

'Elementary' is an American crime drama created by Robert Doherty and loosely based on Sherlock Holmes and other characters appearing in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
