Description:
Chief Scientist of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Dr. Jim Garvin, takes us on a journey to Mercury, Venus, Earth, the moon, near-Earth objects, and Mars. Why does space matter? Why is exploring the inner solar system so crucial? Where will humans and robots venture to next? In this video lecture, filmed July 14, 2010 in NASA Goddard's HD Science Studio with an audience of summer interns and co-op students, Dr. Garvin discusses NASA's past, present, and future of discovery on our nearest neighbors in the solar system.
