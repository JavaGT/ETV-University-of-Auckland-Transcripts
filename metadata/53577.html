Using the money he earned from the space mission, Howard buys a new car. He is also assigned Sheldon's parking space, as Sheldon has never used it. This does not go well with Sheldon, who wants his parking space back even though he does not own a car and does not know how to drive, and begins to engage in a bitter feud with Howard to get back his parking space. The fight eventually spills over to the women's side too, with Amy and Bernadette supporting Sheldon and Howard respectively. Finally, Raj ends their feud once and for all by making Sheldon and Howard foster an agreement where Howard keeps the parking space until Sheldon learns to drive or &quot;gets a Batmobile&quot;.

'The Big Bang Theory' is an American sitcom. The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:28:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-04-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
