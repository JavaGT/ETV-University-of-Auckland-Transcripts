About series:
We lift the lid on some of history&rsquo;s great mysteries by tunnelling deeper, travelling wider, looking more closely, asking harder questions and searching for evidence with more determination than ever before. We are taken to places far and wide and will encounter conspiracy theories, cover ups, strange phenomena, unexplained happenings and mysterious findings &ndash; in short, a whole host of unusual goings on that have had a massive bearing on how we view history today.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:57:11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>THE HISTORY CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-09-13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
