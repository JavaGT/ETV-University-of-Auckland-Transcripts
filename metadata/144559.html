Well, as a Rotorua mum found out, it really is quite easy if you've travelled overseas for weight loss surgery.

About the Series:
Fair Go is a New Zealand consumer affairs television programme hosted by Gordon Harcourt and Pippa Wetzell. First aired in 1977, it is one of New Zealand's longest-running and highest-rated programmes, frequently placed high in the New Zealand TV Guide list of most viewed programs.

The show features a mixture of investigative journalism and consumer affairs stories, based on the motto: &quot;If you've been ripped off, short-changed or given the runaround and nobody wants to know...we do!&quot;

Fair Go also holds the annual Fair Go Ad Awards, in which the best and worst advertisements on New Zealand television are announced, and a competition to find the best 30-second video by New Zealand students is held.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:30:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-07-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
