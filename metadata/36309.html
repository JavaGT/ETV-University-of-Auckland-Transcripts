Ousted despot Muammar Gaddafi was killed overnight in a final assault by new regime forces on his hometown Sirte, ending the last vestiges of his 42-year autocratic rule and sparking joy across Libya

What next for Libya?
Jockeying for power among Libya's well-armed and fractious new leadership may intensify after the death of Muammar Gaddafi, an anxious and, for many, joyous moment in a country hungry for stability and impatient to swap the bullet for the ballot box.
The interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro-Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilise the north African OPEC member and its oil industry. Gaddafi's death is expected to allow Libya to start earning money again by selling its oil on world markets as a more benign security environment allows oilfield staff to get back to work.

Obama responds to Gaddafi's death
President Barack Obama has pledged support for Libya in rebuilding the country after Gaddafi's death.

Gaddafi dead: Lockerbie reaction
Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground. Many victims were Americans from New Jersey and New York flying home for the holidays.
The US government implicated Gaddafi's regime, and a Libyan intelligence agent, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, was convicted as the mastermind.
He was released from British captivity in 2009 on humanitarian grounds because he was supposedly near death. But the fact that he remains alive two years later remains a concern to US officials and relatives of the victims.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>News, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-10-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>17:59:00</td></tr></table>
