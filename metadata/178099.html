In 2011, after a night out with friends, 22-year-old Sian O&rsquo;Callaghan disappeared. When her worried boyfriend reports her missing, Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher begins to piece together her last movements. Believing Sian may still be alive and being held somewhere against her will, Fulcher initiates an urgent full-scale search operation. Through diligent and painstaking police work, Fulcher and his team discover CCTV footage of Sian in the High Street, which leads to vital clues in the investigation. Racing against time, Fulcher edges to a chief suspect, local taxi driver Christopher Halliwell. But, after a tense confrontation at a remote location, what Halliwell discloses sees the investigation taking a completely unforeseen turn. The revelation leaves Fulcher standing on the precipice of a life-changing choice between following police protocol and catching a killer.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:53:20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>UKTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-03-09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
