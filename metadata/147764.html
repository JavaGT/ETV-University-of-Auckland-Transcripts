To make matters worse, Kristin knows the victim &ndash; entrepreneur Andre Barrington &ndash; an ex-boyfriend who moved onto another woman, Grace Turner, an adrenalin junkie and fellow skydiver.
As the investigation unfolds, an unsettling truth is revealed. Andre&rsquo;s parachute was never going to open as the cords were severed. Was it an elaborate suicide or was Grace having second thoughts about Andre?
Then again, Andre&rsquo;s older brother Felix was tired of living in his shadow, and his mother Lorraine&rsquo;s maternal love verged on the side of sinister. Both of them were jumping with Andre too. And what about Andre&rsquo;s business partner Dean Young, who was less than impressed by Andre&rsquo;s work ethic?
Mike and his team are forced to confront the old adage: &lsquo;what goes up must come down&rsquo;&hellip; but not always in the way you want.

About series:
Brokenwood: Population 5000 and declining- slowly- one by one, or two by two depending on the murder rate that week. All-in-all, Brokenwood is a pretty nice place to live- if you watch your back and sleep with one eye open.

Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd and Detective Kristin Sims return for a brand new season of the award-winning local drama series, The Brokenwood Mysteries. Joined by Detective Constable Sam Breen and the rather quirky Dr Gina Kadinsky, they&rsquo;re ready to solve the murders that plague this small, bucolic New Zealand town.
