Effective wound care extends far beyond the application of the wound dressing. Nurses and nursing assistants may be required to assess, plan, implement and evaluate wound care. In order to fulfil these roles, it's critical to have an understanding of the several basic procedures involved in wound care. 

In this program we examine skin anatomy, the classification of wounds, wound procedures, wound dressings, and documentation. Knowledge in each of these areas will allow nurses and nursing assistants to make well informed decisions about wound care and ultimately play an active part in promoting wound healing.
