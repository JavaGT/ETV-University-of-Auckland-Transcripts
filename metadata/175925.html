About series:
Methodical and dashing detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) pushes the boundaries of science to solve Toronto&rsquo;s most gruesome murders at the dawn of the 20th century.

In series 13, Murdoch embarks on more intricate investigations alongside his loyal team.  He&rsquo;ll pioneer the latest forensic techniques to solve the unsolvable, including an eternal youth machine and a twisted murder that takes place during a stage play right in front of him.  As Murdoch traverses the evolving Victorian-turned-Edwardian society, this much-loved detective drama continues to weave the key issues and real-life historical figures of the era into each investigation.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>VIBE</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2020-01-17</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
