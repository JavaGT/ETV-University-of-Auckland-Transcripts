It takes place as the world faces a deepening cost-of-living crisis that carries huge implications for the advancement of the SDGs, especially in developing countries.

Convened by the UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, the Moment will provide world leaders with a platform to showcase the bold actions and solutions that are needed to set the world on course towards achieving the SDGs. The SDG Moment event is expected to build the momentum as we head towards the SDG Summit in 2023.

At a time of great uncertainty, the SDGs &ndash; a blueprint for ending poverty, tackling the climate crisis and boosting the economy &ndash; show the way forward to a better future for all on a safe and healthy planet.

To scale up action on the SDGs would require transformational change with regard to current policies, governance arrangements and economic systems. There is a need for equitable access to vaccine supply, expansive stimulus packages in key sectors and access to financing for developing countries.
