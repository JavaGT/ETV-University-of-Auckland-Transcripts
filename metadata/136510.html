Vipin Gupta, TEDxABQ.

This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Dr. Vipin Gupta is a systems engineer at Sandia National Laboratories. Gupta co-leads a team of scientists, engineers, and technologists who are developing microscale photovoltaic technology that has the potential to fundamentally alter our energy relationship with light. Possible applications of microscale photovolatics literally exist wherever the sun shines. Current prototypes are undergoing testing in a variety of environments, including on the International Space Station.

Vipin Gupta's work has spanned system design, technology innovation, solar technical assistance, human factors engineering, and team development. Vipin earned his PhD in applied physics from Imperial College London and an M.S. in remote sensing from University College London as a US Marshall Scholar as well as a BS in engineering and BA in nuclear security policy and technology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Solar became a significant part of his career when he began leading a project to provide solar technical assistance throughout the United States and innovating with his inventive Sandia teammates in microscale photovoltaics.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:09:35</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Lecture</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Engineering, Science, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2016-09-19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:00:00</td></tr></table>
