A group of modern shopkeepers and their families are on the journey of a lifetime - they're taking over empty shops in a neglected market square in Shepton Mallet to see if they can turn back time for the British High Street. They'll live and trade through six key eras of history and in this episode they move into to the 1930s.

Life should be sweeter this week, as government regulations reduce working hours and cheap sugar means lots of sweets, confectionary and cake. Nostalgia boosts sales for the grocers, who have masses of 1930s recognisable brands, the dressmaker has to sell thirties glamour to the town, and the butcher has good old British beef.

The Edwardian bazaar is now a toy shop, reflecting the shopkeepers' target customers - children. But it is far from plain sailing; the Bakers find themselves running a cake shop, but cakes aren't their forte. Rivalry builds between the grocers and the butchers, underminding the community spirit of the high street.

The shopkeepers spend a week selling the 1930s to the town, but they have to pull out all the stops for Empire day - can they persuade a whole new generation of the joys of the traditional high street?

About the series:
Shopkeepers experience life on the high street in re-creations of six eras of British history in the market square of Shepton Mallet, Somerset. The first episode gives the traders a taste of the 1870s, and the butcher, baker, grocer and ironmonger try to adapt to Victorian life under the scrutiny of Judge Gregg Wallace (MasterChef). They're expected to trade as they would have in the 1870s, but first they must source and make their stock - from strings of sausages to milk churns to picture postcards. They also have to advertise, establish their customer base and provide produce for Market Day. The locals are curious and enthusiastic at first, but the shops will need to provide a real service before the novelty fades and the customers drift away.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:46</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Economics, Food Science, History, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-02-22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>18:00:00</td></tr></table>
