Population counts from the New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings can be displayed by age and sex in population pyramids. This video demonstrates a tool that contains both Census data and population projections in two sets (from 1938-1990 and from 1991-2061) of overlaid graphs that can be played across time.  This dynamic population pyramid allows us to view population changes and see the demographic momentum effect in action (either that of population growth resulting from a youthful age structure or that that of population decline resulting from an older age structure). We can view this process in action, leading up to and beyond the point where natural increase (growth) shifts to become natural decrease (decline). The dynamic population pyramid provides a quick way of seeing, for example, the long-term impact of reduced fertility rate during World War II on the structure of the New Zealand population.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:03:27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-07-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
