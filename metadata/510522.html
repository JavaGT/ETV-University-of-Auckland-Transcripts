Her suitors who visit her always drive her away. Her family desperately tries to get Birdie to marry her off, but her imagination, rebellious demeanor, and her ahead-of-the-time independence lead to clashes with her parents. At that time, her last suitor appears to her birdie, but it is a man who is extremely vulgar. Bonds are tested to see what the family will do.
