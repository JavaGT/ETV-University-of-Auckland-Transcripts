On September 20th, 2017 the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in 90 years made landfall, delivering a massive blow to the US territory.

Hurricane Maria decimated the island&rsquo;s infrastructure, snapping powerlines like toothpicks and toppling homes like they were made of playing cards. The official death toll is currently 34.

In the wake of the storm there's been much talk about the territory's relationship with the United States. President Trump's administration has been widely criticised for its slow response in sending much needed aid to the island. On Tuesday, the president made his first trip to island to see the devastation first hand. Puerto Rican officials say what he saw was that little, if anything, has changed.

The death toll is expected to rise as the 3.5 million residents living on the island continue to struggle to find water, petrol and other basic needs. Only 5 percent of  Puerto Ricans have power and roughly 50 percent are without clean drinking water.

So who will help Puerto Rico?
