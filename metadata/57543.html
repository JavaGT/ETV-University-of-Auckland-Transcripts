This video resource from VEA will ensure that infection control is front of mind for every worker. It starts by outlining the four principles of infection control, followed by a detailed examination of standard precautions that must be undertaken at all times, including a step-by-step demonstration of correct hand washing technique. 

Transmission-based precautions are explained, grouped into three broad groups: contact, droplet, and airborne. Finally, organisational support is described, including the importance of the infection control committee and regular health screenings for all staff.
