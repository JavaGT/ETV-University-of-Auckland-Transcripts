Trapped in a cycle of substance abuse, addiction and crime, thousands of New Zealanders face a bleak future of criminality and incarceration. The Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court (AODTC), Te Whare Whakapiki Wairua, is a fledgling programme that offers adult offenders the chance to face their demons and address their addictions through a unique, supportive yet confronting court process. It is unlike any other courtroom experience, participants receive applause and medals of achievement with unashamed emotion. 

Drug Court is a raw and revealing observational documentary offering a rare window into this groundbreaking initiative that is bravely tackling Aotearoa's adult recidivism problem head on. Following on from Notable Pictures' sensitive and powerful documentary Restoring Hope in 2013, Drug Court once again provides a unique and exclusive insight into an alternative justice model - this time we follow the stories of five convicted criminals who are at various stages of the 12-18 month programme undergoing treatment for their destructive addictions.

A thought-provoking documentary, Drug Court provides unparalleled access to the work of Aotearoa's newest response to recidivist crime.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:19</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Health, Law, New Zealand, Political Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-09-01</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
