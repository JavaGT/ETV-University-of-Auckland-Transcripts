About Islands on the Edge
A privileged view into the lives of a cast of Hebridean animals, narrated by Ewan McGregor. 

'At the edge of the Atlantic lies a land of rock and water. Wind-scoured and rugged yet full of beauty'

The islands of the Hebrides are a superb place for wildlife. In a world of towering cliffs, white-sand beaches and cold clear seas lives an unforgettable cast of wild animals - otters, eagles and red deer, seals, dolphins and basking sharks.
But living here isn't easy. Battered by a wild ocean and some of Europe's most unpredictable weather, the only certainty here is constant change.

Delivering a compelling portrait of a year in these Islands on the Edge, rich in emotional animal stories and photographed by the world's best camera talent - Hebrides is a landmark series to remember.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:09</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Ecology & Environment, Natural History, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-04-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>16:25:00</td></tr></table>
