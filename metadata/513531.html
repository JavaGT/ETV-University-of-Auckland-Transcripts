However, today it is increasingly common to hear te reo used. In this talk, Hemi Kelly explores the benefits of learning te reo Māori, and addresses possible obstacles that have hindered learning in the past, so that the language can continue to flourish and reach new heights of recognition in the future.   This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
