Mourners are gathering outside of the Holy Church of the Sepulchre in Khyber Pass Road, where church leaders had expected some 5000 people to pay their respects during the tangi.
Among those gathered is former All Black Michael Jones, who he had worked with at the Auckland University of Technology, a large contingent of his Taranaki iwi, police and whanau members. Drums began to beat as he was driven into the church grounds.
Waiting inside the church to receive his body are members of Ngati Whatua and a contingent from AUT, where he was chancellor. Earlier today the Prime Minister confirmed a state funeral for former Governor-General Sir Paul Reeves, will be held in Auckland on Thursday.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:42</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-08-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:29:00</td></tr></table>
