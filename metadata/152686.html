Edgy and cinematic, this powerful drama is a haunting exploration of the mind of Sam, a 16-year-old boy on the brink of adulthood, and of the fears of his mother, Jenny, who&rsquo;s been keeping a devastating secret from him.  

 As Sam embarks on a romance with fellow teenager Chrissy, who&rsquo;s just moved to the area with her father Bill, things are about to take a dark turn. Beneath the surface of Sam&rsquo;s charismatic persona, he&rsquo;s not just on the brink of adulthood &ndash; he&rsquo;s about to act on a psychopathic urge to kill.
