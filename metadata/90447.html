Mrs. Brown's Boys is an award winning sitcom created by and starring Irish writer and performer Brendan O'Carroll. The show is based on O'Carroll's stage plays about the character Agnes Browne, which were developed from books and straight-to-DVD films. The sitcom continues the stories of Agnes, now with the shortened surname &quot;Brown&quot;, and her family who are played by real life close friends and family of O'Carroll's. After being slated by critics, the show has become a ratings success in both Ireland, where it is set, and the United Kingdom, where it is recorded. On 29 December 2012 the show began its third series.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:36:50</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Media Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-10-02</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
