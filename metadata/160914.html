About series:
Grand Designs Australia Season 6 is one of the most diverse series yet &ndash; in terms of building styles, personalities and locations. It&rsquo;s an eclectic mix of architectural wizardry borne from outstanding ideas and inspirational people striving to create an environment that truly represents them. Featuring unique builds in diverse locations, such as a home in Kuitpo, South Australia, which has been built in the shape of a leaf, a three four-storey eco-friendly house in inner city Melbourne which measures just 5x4 metres and a derelict vintage electricity substation in Launceston which is transformed into a modern cutting-edge home. On the north coast of Tasmania, a first-time designer and conservationist makes his priority a 30-metre eucalyptus, as he builds a wrap-around treehouse. Melbourne&rsquo;s laneways see a sustainable architect with big plans to turn a crumbling red-brick warehouse into a four-bedroom house. Once again, Grand Designs Australia, hosted by Peter Maddison, brings the characters, the houses and the stories together in an insightful series of inspiration and awe.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:39</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Architecture, Design, Engineering, Social Studies, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>LIVING</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-03-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
