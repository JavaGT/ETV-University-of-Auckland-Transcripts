Controlling the wild animal species that spread TB, and eventually eradicating the disease in wildlife, is a key part of the TB free New Zealand programme and is critical to protecting our $12B meat and dairy export industry. The Animal Health Board uses a range of methods to control possums. 

The vast majority of its TB control operations are ground-based, using a combination of traps and toxins. However aerially applied sodium fluoroacetate, or 1080, remains the most effective and cost-efficient method available to control possums, particularly in New Zealand's notoriously rugged, steep and remote terrain. In this chapter, New Zealand farmers explain why sodium fluoroacetate, or biodegradable 1080 is such an important tool in the battle against bovine tuberculosis.
