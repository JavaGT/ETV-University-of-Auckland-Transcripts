By investigating the secret crimes of a charismatic priest who abused over 200 deaf children in a school under his control &ndash; the film shows the face of evil that lurks behind the smiles and denials of authority figures and institutions who believe that because they stand for good they can do no wrong. 

The film documents the first known public protest against clerical sex abuse in the U.S.A., a struggle of more than three decades that ultimately led to a lawsuit against the Pontiff himself. These heroes, four deaf young men, set out to expose the priest who had abused them and so many others by trying to make their voices &ldquo;heard&rdquo;. Their investigation helped to uncover documents from the secret Vatican Archives that shows the Pope &ndash; who must operate within the mysterious rules of the roman Curia &ndash; as both responsible and helpless in the face of evil.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:58:43</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Political Studies, Religion & Theology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-05-05</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
