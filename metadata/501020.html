Still volunteering at 100!  ASB&rsquo;s Good as Gold!
This week&rsquo;s ASB Good as Gold winner, Jack Field, helped to set up &lsquo;West Auckland Riding for the Disabled&rsquo; in 1976 and has been volunteering with them ever since, still coming to every session. Jack lost his daughter to spina bifida when she was just a baby so he has a true empathy and compassion for children with disabilities. ASB asked Hilary Barry to surprise Jack on his 100th Birthday and made a donation for $10,000 to West Auckland RDA in his name for his long years of service to his community.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:29</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Interview, News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand, News, Social Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-05-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:00:00</td></tr></table>
