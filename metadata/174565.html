The relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea could be summed up in two words: War and peace.

At least 100,000 people are thought to have been killed since the neighbours fought a two-year war over a disputed border region 20 years ago. The war was followed by a tense military standoff.

However, things began to change last year.

Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed agreed to accept an international ruling that sided with Eritrea on the border dispute. 

He launched a peace initiative with Eritrean leader Isaias Afwerki that resulted in diplomatic relations being restored.

Now, Abiy Ahmed has received this year's Nobel Peace Prize.

What message will this send? Why was the Eritrean leader not also honoured?
