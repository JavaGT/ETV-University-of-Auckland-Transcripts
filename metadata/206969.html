About series:
Vinnie Jones is no stranger to roughhousing and competition. But the footballer-turned-actor faces his toughest challenge to date when he goes head to head with men whose tough-as-nails reputations allow them to handle some of Russia's toughest jobs, which Jones also tries to get through in this programme. He tackles missions that have him facing jobs that include being a bodyguard, construction worker and cowboy. While performing the jobs, Jones must face subzero temperatures, sleep out in the wild and go through firearm training to protect Moscow residents from ruthless gangs.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:13</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Geography, Media Studies, Physical Education, Psychology, Social Studies, Sociology, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>M</td><td align='left' valign='top'>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-06-15</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
