About series:
Victoria draws on real-life events and the Queen&rsquo;s own exhaustive diaries to paint a vivid portrait of her transformation from an impulsive eighteen-year- old to her early years as wife, mother and head of a global empire.

Picking up six weeks after the first series ended, the new season establishes Victoria as a working mother, learning to balance her responsibilities as both parent and Queen. However, with Prince Albert still struggling to find a role for himself there is an inevitable power struggle between husband and wife.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:46:48</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2017-10-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
