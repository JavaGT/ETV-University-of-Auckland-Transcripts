Goddard plays a major role in the Hubble servicing mission. Astronauts trained with sophisticated Hubble models in Goddard facilities, and all of the telescope's components went through extensive testing at the center.

Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center staff upload the commands to Hubble that tell it where to point and when, what sensing instruments to use, and when to send data back to Earth. They also troubleshoot any problems that arise. During the servicing mission, the control center plays a vital role in ensuring all the new Hubble components will operate properly after the astronauts install them.
