Hank starts reflecting on an arrest he made earlier in his career regarding a man who committed murder claiming &quot;self-defense against monsters&quot;. With the man&rsquo;s death sentence rapidly approaching and the knowledge he&rsquo;s recently gathered from Nick, Hank begins to wonder if there was more truth to the man&rsquo;s seemingly absurd story then he once thought. Back at the spice shop, Monroe finds himself involved in a situation he never saw coming.
