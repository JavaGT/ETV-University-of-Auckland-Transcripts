About Season 2:
Stars Aden Young as Daniel Holden, who spends nearly 20 years on death row for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, before new DNA evidence nullifies his conviction. He returns home, but he's far from welcomed. He's an outsider now in a town that remains divided by his alleged crime, and contributing to his uncertain future is the man who prosecuted him -- riding that notoriety to become a state senator -- is plotting to reopen the case. As he struggles to adapt, Daniel is comforted by support from his younger sister, Amantha, who has always believed in his innocence and has worked her entire adult life to secure his release. Not so for Ted Jr., Daniel's stepbrother with whom he has no relationship. Insecure and manipulative, Ted is skeptical of Daniel's motives and will do anything to protect his family.

After taking a beating from Bobby Dean and a gang of goons in the Season 1 finale, and spending the five previous episodes in Paulie, Georgia&mdash;where everyone wants to throw Daniel back into his 7x9&mdash;Daniel wonders whether he even wants to continue on.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:41:37</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Criminology, Psychology, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R16</td><td align='left' valign='top'>RIALTO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2015-05-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:55:00</td></tr></table>
