The Aviemore Dam is located over unequal ground underneath, due to the line of the Waitangi Fault. On the northern side in Canterbury, the dam is founded on solid rock, and consists of a 335-metre-long concrete structure. On the southern side in Otago, the dam crosses the fault as a 457 m long earth dam. During the construction of the concrete section, low-heat cement was first used in a large-scale application in New Zealand, to allow quick concrete pouring without the need for cooling elements.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:09:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Engineering, History, New Zealand, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-01-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
