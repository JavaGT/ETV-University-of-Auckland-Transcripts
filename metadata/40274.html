Michael Mosley takes an informative and ambitious journey exploring how the evolution of scientific understanding is intimately interwoven with society's historical path.

In this episode, Michael demonstrates how our society is built on our search to find the answer to what makes up everything in the material world. This is a story that moves from the secret labs of the alchemists and their search for gold to the creation of the world's first synthetic dye - mauve - and onto the invention of the transistor.

This quest may seem abstract and highly theoretical. Yet it has delivered the greatest impact on humanity. By trying to answer this question, scientists have created theories from elements to atoms, and the strange concepts of quantum physics that underpin our modern, technological world.

For thousands of years we have wrestled with the great questions of existence. Who are we? What is the world made of? How did we get here? The quest to answer these is the story of science. In each of the six episodes that make up this BBC series, medical journalist Michael Mosley traces the often unpredictable path we have taken. From recreating a famous alchemist's experiment, to following in Galileo's footsteps, Michael unpicks how science has changed the way we see ourselves, and the way we see our world. It is a tale of courage and of fear, of hope and disaster, of persistence and success. It interweaves great forces of history - revolutions, voyages of discovery and artistic movements - with practical, ingenious inventions and the dogged determination of experimenters and scientists. This is the story of how history made science and how science made history, and how the ideas which emerged made the modern world.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:50:46</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ7</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-02-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:00:00</td></tr></table>
