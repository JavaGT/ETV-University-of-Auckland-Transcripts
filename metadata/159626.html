On this episode of The Stream we discuss three stories related to the ongoing war in Syria.

US troop withdrawal
Last month's surprise announcement from US President Donald Trump helped spark the resignation of defence secretary James Mattis as well as raise questions over who will fill the eventual void. The US has begun scaling back equipment in the region, but it is unclear how long a complete troop withdrawal will take. How will the departure of the US impact Syria, its neighbours and the fight against ISIL?

Ready to reconcile?
Some countries are ready to build ties again with the government of Bashar al-Assad. Last month the UAE reopened its embassy in the country and there have been calls for Syria to re-join the Arab League. What needs to be taken into consideration as diplomatic relations move toward normalisation

Harsh refugee winter
What chance do displaced Syrians have to return home? Harsh winter conditions are making everyday life even more difficult for Syrians sheltering in refugee camps and informal living situations. We'll look at the ongoing humanitarian crisis.
