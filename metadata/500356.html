Why? Waterspouts are clouds that suck water out of lakes and oceans and tornadoes destroy houses. Why do these clouds rotate and how do they produce these effects? At Auckland University researchers study clouds to get answers to some of these questions. A key tool is the weather radar which is a mobile unit and can be taken all round the country and overseas to study severe weather. Short wavelenghth radio waves are reflected from raindrops and by scanning the antenna we can get a complete 3D image of the storm. This data allows us to make computer models of flooding and other severe weather so we will be better able to understand the physical processes going on and consequently make better severe weather warning and forecasts. &lt;br&gt; Featuring Geoff Austin, Professor of Physics and Andrew Peace, PhD student in Physics at the University of Auckland.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:05:45</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2007-07-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:00:00</td></tr></table>
