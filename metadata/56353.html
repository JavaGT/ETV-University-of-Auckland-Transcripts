You've heard, though, that a fun hobby is a great way to improve your French and make French-speaking friends at the same time. For the sake of French, you've decided to make the time. You never really liked to read French that much, so you skip the French bookstore and go to the park where a band is playing a song in French. At first, you have trouble understanding, but little by little, you begin to pick it up. Some dancers nearby call to you in French. They want you to dance with them! In this lesson you'll learn French words related to hobbies. They'll definitely come in handy on your day off.
