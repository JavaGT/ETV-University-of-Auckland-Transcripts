Documentary using CGI to explore how the city of Toronto, Canada, thrives in winter with extreme weather conditions of -40 degrees and savage snowstorms.

'Strip The City' uses stunning CGI animation to strip major cities naked of their steel, concrete, buildings, roads, rivers and bedrock   layer by layer   to explore the secret technology and infrastructure that keeps them running. What stops Dubai's super tall skyscrapers - balanced on unstable sand - from toppling over? How can San Francisco survive - sitting on the edge of a major earthquake fault? And how did the ancient Romans build a city of a million people without modern technology? This series explores these and other mysteries, by peeling the glass off buildings, rolling back the tarmac on roads and sucking the water out of rivers to expose the hidden infrastructure beneath six major cities: London, Rome, Dubai, Sydney, Toronto and San Francisco.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:56:24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Architecture, Engineering, Geography, History, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>DISCOVERY</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-10-07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
