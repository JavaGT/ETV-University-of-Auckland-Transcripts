One aspect that makes PNG quite attractive for users is image quality is perfectly preserved as a result of lossless compression. In this video, we dive into how exactly PNG is able to compress images so well, while also retaining all the information in the image. 

One thing we discover during this journey is how slow PNG is in practice. Towards the end, we discuss a relatively new image format called QOI that is somewhat comparable to PNG, but 20-50x faster. But what's perhaps the most remarkable aspect of QOI is how a simple set of rules lead to surprisingly good compression on a variety of images.
