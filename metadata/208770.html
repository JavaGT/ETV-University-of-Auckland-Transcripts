About series:
The series captures rarely seen behavior that reveals how animals possess emotions and behavior similar to humans -- including the capacity to love, grieve, deceive and invent. Special sequences include a female Nile crocodile gathering her babies in her mouth and carrying them underwater; a female red-billed hornbill waits with her chicks for her mate to bring them food; and a young chimp befriends an abandoned genet kitten.
