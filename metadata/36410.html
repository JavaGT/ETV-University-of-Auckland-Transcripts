This is not a &quot;how to do business in Asia&quot;, rather, Yen for a Dollar uses business as the prism through which we view Asia, but the appeal of the series is much wider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The focus of this series is people. Over four episodes, the program joins a dozen very different Asians in India, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, and takes a side trip to France to view the Asian-Europe relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yen For a Dollar studies the background, activities, work, pleasure, culture, relationships and religion of these twelve people and their friends, family and associates. With them, we savour a geisha dinner in Japan; visit India's remote and arid Tansa Valley; attend a glittering ballroom dance in Singapore; go to the Paris fashion shows; play a war game; chat in a multi-million dollar Mumbai flat; and step into the street for a look at the slum life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All twelve of Yen's subjects are business people. Their businesses include fashion, information technology, retail, investment and funds management, transport, construction and human resources. Without a framework, Asia is far too big and has too many different cultures and countries to grasp. Yen For A Dollar shows how to understand these twelve people and through them, understand a lot more about Asia and its differences and similarities.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:33:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Asian Studies</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata MƒÅori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-10-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>22:29:00</td></tr></table>
