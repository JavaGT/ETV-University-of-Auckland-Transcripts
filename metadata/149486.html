This episode looks at powered flight, revealing why peregrine falcons can top 200 miles an hour, how a hummingbird is a slave to its own rather manic lifestyle and that the albatross's secret to flying for free is its nose.

Heavyweight beetles break the rules to find love, a devious sparrow-hawk uses agility to execute a lightning-fast raid on his prey, and half a million mother bats dominate the sky above, and below, the ground with a dazzling display of aerial prowess.

About series:
Enter the skyworld and experience the lives of jumping, gliding, and flying creatures like never before in this groundbreaking wildlife series. Flight is the ultimate superpower, an extraordinary ability most of us can only dream of. Yet, from squirrels to spiders, frogs to fish, and birds to bats, an astonishing number of animals have mastered the skies. With exceptional skills and breathtaking design, these animals hunt, travel, sleep, live, and die in the air. The world above us has always been a mystery, a place that humans could not enter or understand. But now, with cutting-edge filming technology, we can follow these creatures into the skies, revealing their hidden world. Life in the Air allows us to 'fly' alongside the animals and see the world from their unique point of view, as it captures extraordinary animal behaviour and reveals the amazing science of flight.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:49:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Biology, Ecology & Environment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ANIMAL PLANET</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2018-01-12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:30:00</td></tr></table>
