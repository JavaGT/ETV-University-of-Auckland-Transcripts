This Episode:
Maverick investor, Jim Rogers says he thinks oil prices are set to rise &quot;beyond anyone's expectations&quot; and the US economy will slow down as a result. Aged just five, Rogers was selling peanuts for profit. He became a hedge fund pioneer, a commodities trader and, years ago, he shifted much of his money, and his family too, out of the US and into Asia.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:31:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>News</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>BBC World News</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2011-05-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>03:29:00</td></tr></table>
