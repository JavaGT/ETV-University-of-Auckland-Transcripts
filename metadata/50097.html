The concept of the programme is showing members of the public obtaining treatment and advice for unusual, obscure or embarrassing medical issues that they are &quot;too embarrassed&quot; to go to a general practitioner about. A contradiction to this notion is that if patients were too embarrassed to see their own GPs, why would they bare all on television? A possible explanation is that patients are hoping to find a solution to their medical problems that their own GPs have been not been able to resolve. As well as showing patients' visits to the doctor, the possible effects of certain people's occupations, such as cyclists or football players, is also shown.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:02:30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>AO</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-01-10</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
