Join Ruud Kleinpaste as he presents a four part docu-drama tracing the history of New Zealand farming and agriculture. He shows the process and development of agricultural settlement in New Zealand, from Maori farmers to Pakeha settlers and pioneers, and explores the efforts of late 19th and early 20th century farmers to convert New Zealand land into lush pasture and grain crops. We see the close relationship in New Zealand between scientists and farmers and explore the politics, both national and international of farming, tracing it's history right up to the decline of the rural economy in the 1980s.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:57</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Agriculture & Horticulture, Ecology & Environment, Economics, Maori, New Zealand, Science, Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TVNZ HEARTLAND</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-06-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>10:00:00</td></tr></table>
