An important aspect of their plan is to enable the farm to provide fresh produce that will be served in the National Trust restaurant. Finally, after some 50 meetings, they get the green light, but for Sarah, acting as consultant on the restaurant, things don't go as smoothly as she'd hoped. Adam is halfway through researching his latest book, a history of Sissinghurst. He introduces us to the rich cultural milieu of his grandmother who, aside from creating the most influential garden of the 20th century, had affairs with many other women.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:08:56</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-07-30</td><td align='center' valign='top'>19:29:00</td></tr></table>
