When the dirty dairying controversy struck in the early 2000s, it was a body blow to Southland farmers Vaughan and Megan Templeton. The couple had recently converted their 425 hectare farm near Riverton from sheep to dairy cows and were working hard to be environmentally responsible.Three generations of Vaughan's family have farmed on the Otaitai flats but they've all done something different on the land. Vaughan's grandfather and father were both flax millers. In its hey-day, flax was one of New Zealand's biggest export earners. The dried fibre was used to make ropes, wool packs and baling twine.
Des Templeton gave up flax milling in 1972 when the industry could no longer compete with cheaper imports but he re-opened his mill a few years back as a museum.

Till recently, he was running the mill for tourists and selling the fibre to artists and crafts people. Sadly, Des passed away soon after Country Calendar visited the flax mill, but the enterprise will continue with Vaughan taking over as host. Vaughan's learned a lot about flax milling over the years, but it was sheep farming that paid the bills when he was first in charge of the family land. He stuck with that for 15 years but needed a new challenge. &quot;I'm not the world's most patient man - and sheep do try your patience,&quot; says Vaughan. Converting to dairying was a big decision for the couple, partly because of the cost involved.
&quot;I remember saying to Megan if we do go dairy farming we'll never be able to pay off the debt - we'll have to live with putting a zero on our interest bill,&quot; he says. &quot;And we didn't actually lose sleep over it and that was good. You have to be able to make that call - and we could.&quot;Looking after the fragile soils on Vaughan's farm was another consideration.  His property runs down to the beach and the soils are all sand-based with varying amounts of topsoil. But one of the biggest problems the couple faced was not knowing much about dairy farming. They hired Warren Calder as manager and it's been a successful partnership.
