For 56 of her 57 years, Brooke Shields has been in show business. Television, movies, modelling - her career has been impressive, but not without controversy.

Brooke&rsquo;s own story is brutally honest, revealing her darkest and most traumatic secrets. Channel 9 &lsquo;60 Minutes&rsquo;

Up In Arms
It sounds like twisted logic, but military forces everywhere argue that the greater the firepower they possess, the greater the chance of maintaining peace. The theory is being tested like never before as the US shows the world, and more particularly China, its increasing presence in the Indo Pacific. We explore what&rsquo;s happening in the hotly-contested South China Sea and reveal the U.S. military in full flight. Channel 9 &lsquo;60 Minutes&rsquo;

Pet Hate
We&rsquo;re a nation of cat lovers &ndash; more than 40% of Kiwi households have a feline. But new evidence has confirmed cats are ravaging native wildlife in remote parts of Aotearoa. And that&rsquo;s reignited a fierce debate on how to manage the growing number of domestic kitties turning into savage predators. So, is it time to lock up our favorite pets and stop them from roaming free? Sunday speaks to advocates on both sides of the divide, fighting for animal rights from very different corners.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:01:26</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs, Documentary, Interview, Magazine, News, Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Health, History, Media Studies, New Zealand, News, Political Studies, Psychology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 1</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-05-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:03:00</td></tr></table>
