Firemen from three engines try to control the blaze and stop it spreading to adjoining buildings. The firemen brave dense smoke (without any breathing apparatus) as they try to get to the seat of the fire. Parts of the ceiling crash down onto the theatre seats below. 01.20 War Work, Making Sten Guns: Barrels from old 303 rifles are the foundation of a new gun - the Sten light automatic. Gun-making had never been attempted in New Zealand before so dies had to be made and, where materials weren't available, substitutes had to be found. For instance, there was no steel piping for the air jackets so a press, which made radio parts in wartime, was used to shape flat steel into tubes that were later welded. The magazines were also made out from pressed steel and then spot welded. The last stage is the blacking process where all parts are dipped in a caustic solution to prevent rust. After the rifles are fully assembled, they are tested for accuracy on the range. The NZ-made rifles are cheap to make, light and efficient to use and pack a real punch. 03.55 Auckland, Launching &quot;K&quot; Boats: In the Government shipbuilding yard on the Auckland waterfront, the finishing touches are being made to a fleet of 8 motor towboats built for the US Pacific forces. Each boat bears the name of a Maori chief and begins with the letter &quot;K&quot;. The 8 boats form a Mosquito fleet that is part of the biggest boat building yet attempted in New Zealand. War has brought new life to an industry that was dying. Mr Sullivan, the Minister of Supply, speaks at the official launch of the K boats and then all eight of the stout 45 footers are slide down the slipways into the water. &quot;Ours is the task to build them and we can do it!&quot;</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:06:12</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Short Film</td><td align='left' valign='top'>History, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2010-10-20</td><td align='center' valign='top'>13:46:19</td></tr></table>
