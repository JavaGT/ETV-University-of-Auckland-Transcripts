Take a look back at Chris and Reagan's wild wedding day.

'Up All Night' is an irreverent look at modern parenthood. Christina Applegate stars as Reagan Brinkley: loving wife, successful career woman, life of the party and, most recently, mom. Determined not to compromise her career or cool reputation to the clich&eacute;s of motherhood, Reagan adjusts to life with a baby and returns to work with the support of her stay-at-home husband, Chris (Will Arnett).
As Reagan and Chris figure out their new life, self-doubt, sleep deprivation and the pressure of today's parenting protocols rattle their confidence. What's more, the endless needs of Reagan's boss, ambitious but vulnerable talk-show host Ava (Maya Rudolph), threaten to throw Reagan off balance.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:29:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>FOUR</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-10-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
