After a flashback reveals that Caleb was indeed wounded when he and Maeve destroyed the last Rehoboam computer, we&rsquo;re back to the present, where Caleb has just been infected with one of those human-controlling flies while Hale (Tessa Thompson) gloats over him. The good news is that it takes a while for the parasite to grab the reins, so when Maeve makes a very destructive distraction by turning the weird sound-cone thing (that gives orders to controlled humans) to max volume, Caleb grabs Hale, and they and Maeve escape to Mobworld&hellip; where the already infected park-goers have been ordered to gun them and seemingly everybody else down. Although Caleb has a close call and nearly shoots Maeve himself, the three of them manage to steal a car and drive out of the park to be rescued by an extraction team. It is probably worth noting that Delos&rsquo; newest park went to hell and got many, many people killed on its very first night.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:48:36</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Engineering, Information Technology, Psychology, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>SOHO</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2022-07-18</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:35:00</td></tr></table>
