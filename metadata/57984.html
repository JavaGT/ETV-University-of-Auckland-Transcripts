With the death of Professor Tupperman, a vacancy for a tenured position opens up. Sheldon, Leonard, Raj and Barry Kripke fight for the post and try to impress the head of the tenure committee, who happens to be Mrs. Janine Davis, the HR administrator of Caltech. Both Leonard and Kripke exercise along with her at the gym in an attempt to talk to her, with Leonard eventually suffering an asthma attack; Raj sends her a 90-minute video about himself; Sheldon gifts her a DVD of the TV miniseries Roots to make up for his racist comments about her in The Egg Salad Equivalency but, puzzled when she clearly doesn't appreciate that either, offends her by asking &quot;you are black, right?&quot;. Sheldon, Leonard and Raj eventually decide to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman as the tenure committee is going to be there, with Sheldon and Leonard deciding to take Amy and Penny respectively with them to boost their reputation with the committee. When they encounter each other at the memorial service, they lash out at each other, with even Amy and Penny joining in support of their respective boyfriends. The fight stops only when Leonard comes to his senses and realizes that he would rather lose the tenured post than lose his friends. The five decide to return home, but when they see Kripke flattering Mrs. Davis, they attend the memorial anyway. Eventually, Sheldon, Leonard and Raj are shortlisted for the tenured position purely based on their accomplishments. Sheldon thanks Mrs. Davis for shortlisting him, but offends her again by giving her what he believes is a &quot;traditional black handshake&quot;.

'The Big Bang Theory' is an American sitcom. The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:27:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Comedy, Entertainment</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Drama, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>TV 2</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-07-03</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
