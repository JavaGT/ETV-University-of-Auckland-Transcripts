The Monterey 5 are back.

On the surface, in the tranquil seaside town of Monterey, California, everything seems the same. The mothers continue to dote, the husbands support, the children remain adorable and the houses are just as beautiful. But the night of the school fundraiser changed all that, leaving the community reeling as the &ldquo;Monterey Five&rdquo; &ndash; Madeline, Celeste, Jane, Renata and Bonnie &ndash; bond together to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.

The new season explores the malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting. Relationships will fray, loyalties will erode&hellip;and the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom.
