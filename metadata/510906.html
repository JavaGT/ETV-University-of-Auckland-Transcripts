They won't be giving advice on how life should be lived, because this is a history series. Instead, they'll teach you about the earliest forms of life on Earth, and some of the ways that they developed into the types of life we know, love, and sometimes don't love so much (I'm looking at you here, opossums). You'll learn about prokaryotes, eukaryotes, panspermia, reproduction, a little about DNA, and even a thing or two about trees. Maybe.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:13:28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Lecture</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Astronomy, Ecology & Environment, History, Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2023-06-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:50:00</td></tr></table>
