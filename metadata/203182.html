Testing the limits of the human body time and again is what English explorer Ed Stafford does for a living. Self-filming survival experiments for Discovery Channel, Stafford's adventures have included attempting a 60-day stay on an uninhabitable tropical island in the Pacific Ocean without any supplies, including clothes. Now, he's back to battle other extreme environments around the world, like subtropical forests, dry deserts and desolate mountain ranges. In 10 days or less, Ed's task is to reach civilization. He has a camera kit but no map, compass or tools, so he must rely on his extensive survival skills and willpower to combat hunger, thirst, fatigue and dangerous predators.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:07</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Reality</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Ecology & Environment, Health, Media Studies, Physical Education, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ChoiceTV</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-03-25</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
