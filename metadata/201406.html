In his trilogy of documentaries centred around the Westboro Baptist Church, Louis explores the price the family was paying for its devotion to the distorted vision of its patriarch, Pastor Fred Phelps. With Pastor Phelps now dead, the family has been torn apart &ndash; some of its members are still utterly devoted, whilst others have left, forbidden from ever contacting their families again.

Louis also reflects on how physical and mental health or forces beyond our own control can threaten to derail our family lives. He catches up with contributors from Trans Kids and A Different Brain to see how life has changed since he saw them last.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:05:58</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Business, Careers, Geography, Health, History, Law, Leadership, Media Studies, Philosophy, Political Studies, Psychology, Religion & Theology, Science, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>R18</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-02-24</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:45:00</td></tr></table>
