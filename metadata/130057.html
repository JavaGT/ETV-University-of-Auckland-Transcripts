About the series:
&quot;On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy was killed, and the world changed. What if you could change it back?&quot; Take a journey to find out in the genre-busting 11.22.63, an epic new event series from J.J. Abrams (Lost) and acclaimed international author Stephen King.

Based upon the bestselling novel written by King and starring a terrific ensemble cast embodying deeply complex characters, 11.22.63 hurtles deep into the unpredictable darkness of the American dream. Jake Epping, a high school teacher at a loss with his life, wants to make a difference and do something meaningful. Encouraged by an ailing friend, Jake journeys back in time to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Voyaging into the world of 1960s Texas, Jake explores the multiple mysteries surrounding the alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. But Jake's mission faces threats not only from Oswald, but also Sadie, a beautiful librarian with whom he falls in love, and from the past itself, which doesn't want to be changed.
