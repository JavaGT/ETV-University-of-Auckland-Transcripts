The drama - Akina - follows a group of contemporary M?ori characters and uses bilingual dialogue in a way that illustrates the use and meaning of the M?ori words and phrases. The amount of M?ori used in the stories increases as the series progresses and the competence of viewers increases.

The weekly tutorial, recaps what happened in the drama and adds the basics such as counting, colours and the days of the week. Other segments teach waiata (songs), tikanga (customs), kupu hou (new words) and kiwaha (colloquial phrases).

M?ori is one of New Zealands three official languages, and now is the time to learn it with K?RERO MAI.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:22</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Drama, Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Maori, New Zealand</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Whakaata Māori</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2014-06-16</td><td align='center' valign='top'>12:00:00</td></tr></table>
