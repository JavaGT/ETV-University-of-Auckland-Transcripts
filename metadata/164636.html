the westward migration undertaken by 'The Grapes of Wrath's' Joad family.
Through chance encounters with everyday Americans, the cyclists expand on the 
novel&rsquo;s core themes of migration, inequality and the perceived land of opportunity. 
The group explores whether America has progressed since the book was written, 
discussing the wealth gap, immigration and the American Dream.
The fascinating people they meet along the way reveal the enduring strength of 
human spirit despite the inequality and disenfranchisement which runs as deep 
today, as it did in Steinbeck&rsquo;s seminal novel.
The Bikes of Wrath is a unique, funny and insightful documentary filled with 
adventure, literature, music, and human connection.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:47:55</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Art, Media Studies, Physical Education, Sport</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ARTS CHANNEL</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2019-06-27</td><td align='center' valign='top'>21:30:00</td></tr></table>
