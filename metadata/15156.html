Each of these children has dealt with traumas that most adults will never experience in a lifetime. The film tells their stories and celebrates the heroics of three youngsters who, despite everything, remain lively, happy and grounded. 
 At only 18 months old, Terri Calvesbert suffered horrific 85 per cent burns when her house caught fire. Terri defied medical odds to survive the first night after the fire, but lost most of her skin, her ears, her fingers, all of her hair and one foot. Since then she has undergone 16 major and 30 minor operations in an attempt to reconstruct her body and reduce her scarring. 
 Danielle Griffin is another little girl who has had to overcome almost unimaginable challenges. Ten year-old Danielle is six inches shorter than her four year-old sister Maisy, and is likely to be trapped in her 2ft 6in body for the rest of her life. Danielle suffers from pseudo-achondroplasia, a rare form of dwarfism. 
 The last of this trio of extraordinary children is Callum Chapman, who has the responsibility of caring for his mother, Elli. Elli suffers from a genetic ligament deficiency that means she struggles to walk, depends on crutches and a wheelchair, and has to spend much of her time in bed. With Callum?s father out of the picture, Callum has become the man of the house and has been named Elli?s main carer. Without him, Elli wouldn?t be able to leave the house: ?I am mum?s legs,? says young Callum.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:09:54</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Health</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Unrated</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2009-06-28</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
