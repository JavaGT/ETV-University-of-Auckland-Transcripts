This is causing dismay among those at the forefront of New Zealand&rsquo;s #Metoo movement as two more similar cases went through the opaque Law Society complaints process.

James Gardner-Hopkins, a former partner at Russell McVeagh in Wellington, this week had his two-year suspension from practising extended to three years by the High Court.

The High Court decision noted that, had the matter been considered closer to the offending, &ldquo;the misconduct would have justified striking off&rdquo;.

However, it now believed the chances of him reoffending were &ldquo;considerably diminished&rdquo; due to therapy he had undergone, a change in life circumstances, and a lack of further complaints and this helped scale back his sanction.
