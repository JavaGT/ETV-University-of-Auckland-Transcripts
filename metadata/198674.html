Observe the lush green land prowled by woolly mammoths and Saber-toothed tigers and rewind to the age of dinosaurs, where Pterodactyls circled the skies in search of their prehistoric prey. Focusing on America, series highlights include; an investigation into New York City's past, which mammoths and sea scorpions called home. While many people know that ferocious dinosaurs and large mammals used to roam America, very few realise that these creatures stalked the exact sites where both major cities and the most famous landmarks have been built. We are walking in the footsteps of these extinct animals every day, without even realising it.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:59:50</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Documentary</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Archaeology, Geography, History, Information Technology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>ANIMAL PLANET</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2021-01-08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:30:00</td></tr></table>
