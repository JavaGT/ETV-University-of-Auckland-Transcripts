Twenty-four years ago the All Blacks and France did battle at Eden Park.
The All Blacks won the game, and David Kirk held the trophy aloft - the only All Blacks captain to have done so. Close Up is joined by Kirk and fellow former All Blacks captain Taine Randell.

The enigma of a France-All Blacks clash 
Tonight Close Up talks to former All Black Alan Whetton, who experienced joy in 1987 and then despair in 1991, and to former France player Serge Betsen who was there in 2007 when the French won in Cardiff.
