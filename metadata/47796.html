As the Stark and Lannister armies prepare for their first battle against one another, Tyrion leads his barbarian allies into battle while Robb and Catelyn bargain for a renegade Lord's help. With Drogo dying from his infected wound, Daenerys goes to desperate measures to save her husband's life by using a witch's blood magic, much to the horror of the Dothraki. At the Wall, a Targaryen reveals himself &ndash; and the price of loyalty &ndash; to Jon, who worries about events outside of the Wall. In a final bid to save his daughters' lives, Ned falsely confesses to conspiracy and swears fealty to Joffrey as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. To the horror of Ned's daughters &ndash; and delight of the assembled crowd &ndash; Joffrey has him executed regardless.
