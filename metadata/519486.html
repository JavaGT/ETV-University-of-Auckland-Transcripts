What role do music and musicians have in the fight for liberation?
This episode explores how music is interwoven with liberation struggles, particularly in the current war on Gaza. Through a conversation with prominent artists such as rapper and activist Saul Williams, Arab-American singer Leila Hegazy, and Lebanese-Palestinian singer Anees &ndash; who have been raising their voices for Palestine &ndash; we look at why they think art has historically played an important role in shifting global consciousness. We also hear from Rahaf, a singer from Gaza, about her hopes and how vital music is in the midst of despair.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:25:08</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Current Affairs</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Information Technology, News, Political Studies, Social Studies, Sociology</td><td align='left' valign='top'>PGR</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Aljazeera, English</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2024-05-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>08:30:00</td></tr></table>
