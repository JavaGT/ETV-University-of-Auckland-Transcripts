Lyrics:

Underground, moles are little animals with really weird noses who like to dig around
Round and brown, every here and there you'll find a hairy brown spot on your skin, we also call that a mole!
Search around, moles are spies who work in private espionage, they spy in secret, and they don't make a sound

Also found, 
Everywhere in mexico Mole is a spicy sauce
Same spelling but a whole different sound!
Turnaround blind eyes
Don't you know it's more than you can tell
Turnaround blind eyes, moles can also mean something else 
'Cos in chemistry a mole. 
Is a unit used to measure,
The atoms or molecules,
In a substance of whatever!
It's the number of carbon twelve atoms 
In twelve grams of carbon...
Matter's filled with way too many atoms to count,
So use Avagadro's number to express the amount!

For any type of matter: solid, liquid or gas, 
The grams within a mole will equal atomic mass.
All you need is a mole!
Six-oh-two sextillion!  
Six-oh-two sextillion!

Six point oh two two, one four oh seven eight,
Times 10 to power of twenty three
That number's a mole
We use it in chemistry.

Once upon a time Avagadro said hey!
And showed us the way out of the dark,
His number you must use,
A molar eclipse of the heart.
A molar eclipse of the heart.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:02:49</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Mathematics, Physics, Science</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'></td><td align='center' valign='top'>2013-06-11</td><td align='center' valign='top'>01:00:00</td></tr></table>
