The Naked Chef was a BBC Two television cooking programme starring Jamie Oliver. It originally ran for three seasons plus three subsequent Christmas specials, and was produced  for the BBC. The show was Oliver's television debut, and was noted for its use of jumpy, close-up camera work, and the presenter's &quot;Mockney&quot; dialect and relaxed style - for example, Oliver would tear up herbs rather than chopping.
The programme was credited with inspiring men to cook due to Oliver's &quot;blokey&quot; approach.
Each episode was notionally based around a social situation or event in Oliver's life, such as a hen night or babysitting. In Seasons 1 and 2 (except the Christmas specials), Jamie was filmed cooking at his home (paid for by the BBC). In Season 3, the kitchen locations shifted to other venues.</td><td align='center' valign='top'>00:32:00</td><td align='center' valign='top'>Instructional</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Careers, Food Science, Health, Travel & Tourism</td><td align='left' valign='top'>G</td><td align='left' valign='top'>Sky Open</td><td align='center' valign='top'>2012-02-21</td><td align='center' valign='top'>20:00:00</td></tr></table>
