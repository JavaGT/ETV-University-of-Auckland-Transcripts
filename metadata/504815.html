A damning investigation into Dr Nigel Murray's spending shows the former Waikato District Health Board chief executive was stood down from his top job at a health authority in Canada months before he secured the role in Hamilton.

And the critical information was missed in checks by former DHB chairman Bob Simcock during Murray's recruitment to Waikato because Simcock did not ask Murray's former employer for a reference.

Murray was president and CEO at Fraser Health Authority in British Columbia when a Government-ordered review found the health authority to be the worst-performing in the country.

After the 1200-page report was released an incoming chairman to Fraser Health, Wynne Powell, told Murray the review identified &quot;unsatisfactory and unacceptable issues&quot;, according to the State Services Commission inquiry investigator John Ombler.

Powell went on to tell Murray: &quot;Fraser Health is experiencing substantive leadership issues that do not serve the authority's required outcomes nor assist the health system as a whole for British Columbia&quot;.

Powell told Murray his employment would terminate the next year, on November 27, 2015 but that effective immediately on May 29, 2014 Murray would no longer continue as president and chief executive of Fraser Health.

Murray's at-risk bonus was withheld and he was offered another role within the British Columbia Government but turned it down, citing family reasons for wanting to return to New Zealand.
