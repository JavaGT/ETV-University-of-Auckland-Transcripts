In the extraordinary wilderness of Australia and New Zealand a bunch of daredevil kids experimented with something that would change the world of adventure travel. Through 45 years of the most stunning original footage we join the original extreme sports pioneers in an epic journey of adrenaline seeking. Their global quest for adventure takes us on the road less traveled during the  60&prime;s and 70&prime;s to witness firsthand the discovery of amazing paradises that few ever knew of &ndash; before they tragically disappeared. Yet the very same pioneering spirit provides the answer to turning it all around.

&quot;LAST PARADISE&rdquo; uses the world&rsquo;s most exciting adventure to address the world&rsquo;s most crucial issues. Through the untold story of extreme sport pioneering and 45 years of stunning original footage, we are alerted to what was once &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for our planet,  how dramatically it has changed in one lifetime, and how the spirit of innovation can save it.
