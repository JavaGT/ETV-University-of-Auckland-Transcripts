Ridicule, threats of bodily harm, and scorn &ndash; this is what Israeli actress and playwright Einat Weizman endured for participating in art and activism focused on Israel-Palestine politics.

In the docu-play &ldquo;Shame 2.0&rdquo;, Weizman and Palestinian actor Morad Hassan explore the difficulties of producing politically-driven theatre, and the challenges they have faced because of their beliefs and backgrounds.

Einat and Morad share their narratives in individual monologues, recounting the hurdles they had to overcome to progress their respective careers in a contentious political climate. In each performance, Weizman and Morad are periodically interrupted by news footage of Israeli culture minister Miri Regev, whose efforts to pull government funding from organisations or events deemed disloyal to the state has been criticised as a form of censorship.

In this episode, Morad Hassan, Einat Weizman, and Shame 2.0 actress Colleen Delany discuss how they are using the production to highlight obstacles artists and activists must overcome to break down barriers in Israel and the occupied territories.
