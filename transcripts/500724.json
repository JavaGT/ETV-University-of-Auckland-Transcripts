The head pastor of Kiwi Megachurch arise steps aside after allegations of abuse. Russia warns of unpredictable consequences for countries like New Zealand that have supplied Ukraine with weapons. And a huge crowd enjoys the Wellington Sunshine and the football for the first Phoenix home game in almost a year. Kuro good evening. Police have shot dead a man after a late-night vehicle stop near New Plymouth. The family has confirmed a news hub the victim was local man, Chaos Price. Police haven't released many details about the shooting and tonight part of State Highway 3 in Tattanoaki remains closed, with a cordon so far away that our cameras can't see the scene or the police investigation. Kali Kallahan reports from New Plymouth. Commuters in and out of New Plymouth forced to take a detour around a crime scene. Police stopped a vehicle down this stretch of Devin Road just outside New Plymouth at around 9.30 last night. But just what led to a trigger being pulled is unclear. Police have released very few details about what happened, including why the car was stopped, how many people were in it and if anyone was armed. That's in stark contrast to the last time a person was shot dead by police in Auckland's Glen Eden in November. That day police commissioner Andrew Costa himself fronted a media conference giving the police version of what happened. Today no one fronted and nothing was explained. Police have yet to name the victim, but the family confirmed to News Hub he was Chaos Price, who was left critically injured after being shot and died later at the scene. It's never good when it's close to home, and we don't think things like that happen down here, but they do. So, yeah, it's not good. Maybe in one of the biggest cities, but not here in New Plymouth. This is as close as we can get to the scene. We've been to both cordons on either side of it, and they've been manned by security guards blocking access to the spot where the shooting happened. At both ends, we couldn't see the scene, so all day police have been investigating their own fatal shooting of a person away from cameras. Police say they've already begun a critical incident investigation and have also notified the independent police conduct authority. The officers involved in the shooting are being supported by welfare services and their colleagues. Police have now killed 40 people in New Zealand since 1990. One of the most well-known cases was not far away in Waitara, where in 2000, Stephen Wallace was shot and killed by police after going on a rampage with a baseball bat and a golf club. Tonight, many questions around this shooting remain unanswered. Kaylee Callahan News Hub. A 46-year-old man has been charged with murdering a Christchurch woman who was isolating at home with COVID-19. 64-year-old Val Heaney, a carer for people with intellectual disabilities, was found dead in her Bromley home last week. Initially, police treated the death as unexplained, but upgraded it to a homicide inquiry after the autopsy. Police say the man was known to Heaney. The leader of one of New Zealand's largest megachurches has resigned from the board after church members made several allegations of mistreatment against him. A rise church founder John Cameron has stepped aside from his pastoral duties while two independent reviews are conducted. Kasha Brownley reports. God, I thank you that your death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, your son. Easter Sunday is one of the busiest days of the year for churches. Arise Church wasn't just dealing with a sermon, but also serious allegations. They definitely encourage lots of domestic violence behaviours. They encourage lots of homophobia and they weren't advocates for mental health at all. Allegations like these made against Arise Church founder John Cameron were brought to light by former TV 3 journalist David Farrier. Your actions have consequences. Farrier's reporting has sparked two independent reviews. Over the last two weeks, that's sort of, you know, it's been an outpouring of incredibly you know, incredibly toxic stories coming out with from within a rise. So to have it to have some sort of ripple effect and to have victims be listened to is really good. Stories that included. I personally witnessed John very aggressively grab another staff member by the collar. It doesn't take much for him to absolutely blow up at you and make you feel like. People overlooked this behaviour because it's a righteous anger. Afterwards, backstage, he grabbed me by the collar, aggressive and angry, and told me I had prevented a move of God in Wellington. And find ourselves exactly where God wants us to be. Wellington-based John Cameron and his brother Brent have both resigned from the Arise Board. John has stepped aside, not resigned from his pastoral duties. Brent is on leave. Farrier has also uncovered much more serious claims that don't involve John or Brent Cameron. What I have found out more recently talking to staff and former interns is that they have come forward to the church with allegations of rape and sexual assault from other church members or people in their lives. Ferrier says these stories have been hushed up. These stories are pretty serious and the fact he hasn't resigned is incredibly problematic. and they had an Easter service today. There was not one mention of anything that is going on within the church. News Hub spoke to church members in Wellington and Christchurch following their Easter sermons today. We don't know what happened. Every church has a history and so it's, everyone has a story as well. we're just here to celebrate Easter so that is all it's the beauty of living in New Zealand right our freedom to be able to I don't know have our religion and community like have community affect together the Pentecostal church has 12 different campuses throughout New Zealand with more than 10,000 members a former church member who wanted to remain anonymous likened it to a cult. They are super manipulative in what you do, how you act, how you dress, who you can be friends of who you can't, what to do with your life. And then he's like, no, no, no, that's not good enough. We asked the church for an interview with John Cameron today, but our request was declined. Okay, Keisha, John Cameron had no response, but has the church responded? Well, in a statement, the arise board chairperson said the board was unable to comment on specific allegations due to sensitivity and privacy reasons, but added we strongly encourage anyone who has a complaint or negative experience to engage with the independent reviewer. It is important to hear and understand these stories in order to help bring relief and healing to those who are in pain and put into place any corrective action that may be needed. Kasha Brownlee live from Christchurch. Kasia, thank you for the updates. Overseas now, the Kremlin has warned countries that supply weapons to Ukraine, including New Zealand, to stop or risk unpredictable consequences. Meanwhile, more than 900 civilian bodies have been found in the town surrounding Kiev, some in mass graves after Russia's withdrawal from the city. Here's ITVs Yasmin Bottleby. Many Russian troops may have pulled back, but their missiles are still hitting Ukrainian cities. At least one person was killed after rocket struck a residential area in Kharkiv. This man described how two people were hit by a shell as they walked down the road. Amid the devastation, people were treated on the streets. Smoke was also seen billowing over Kiev. Even as people tried to get back some semblance of normal life in the capital, the war continues around them. Just days ago, Boris Johnson visited this city. He won't, though, be going back to Moscow anytime soon. He was welcomed here five years ago, but today he and a dozen other senior ministers have been banned from Russia. Predictable, perhaps. But in a more sinister move, the Kremlin has also made threats of unpredictable consequences to countries that continue to supply weapons to Ukraine. But more weapons is exactly what President Zelensky says he must have from the West. Without them, he says, peace cannot be achieved. There is no peace, though, even where Russian forces have retreated. Local police on the outskirts of Kiev say 900 bodies have now been found, many in mass graves. More dignified funerals are starting to take place. 13-year-old Elise was shot while trying to flee the fighting. He joins the unknown number of innocent victims of this cruel war. Kim Jong-un has observed new missile tests in North Korea aimed at boosting his regime's nuclear capabilities. The projectile missiles are said to be a new type of tactical guided weapon and were fired into the eastern sea towards Japan. This is the 12 such test already this year. Well, the morning commute is a headache for anyone, but for people with disabilities, it can be far worse. They say when taxi or ride-chair service drivers see their wheelchairs or support animals, they sometimes abuse or overcharge them or cancel their trip. After experiencing these hardships firsthand, two business partners are looking to create an app that will solve these problems. Here's Kethiki Maslamani. When Raymond Duffton first met his business partner, Barney Koneferi Nisi, he knew something was wrong. He's getting out of a little hatchback car and I thought, well, this is taking longer than normal. He said, I think I've just got ripped off Raymond. I said, what do you mean? He says, the guy wanted $240 to bring me from Middlemore Hospital to here. The taxi journey should have cost $65 to $75, $80 in peak-car traffic. The driver takes longer routes to raise the meter because that taxi driver knows that that person with a disability has a concession card to mobility. That will chop the fare in half. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. When they surveyed 300 people with disabilities, female respondents reported being sexually harassed and assaulted, and 71% reported cancellations after drivers saw their service animals or wheelchairs. Most of these drivers, what they don't realize is that after they ditch us, we were supposed to get picked up, most of us go to the toilet and cry ourselves, and we end up missing our meetings. But they found complaints to taxi and ride chair companies fell on deaf ears, so the partners took things into their own hands. Rather than going negative, let's do something positive. I also put their same energy into creating our own service. Their business plan hangs in Barney's room, and there's a give-a-little page to raise $80,000 for one van and an app. An app developers Mobley says it'll cater for different physical capabilities. It's ultimately people are trying to get from A to B, so if we can help them do that and take the technology side and make it easier, that's what we do. The pair are a long way off from reaching their financial goal, but are hopeful gains from their first van will snowball into a fleet. Barney says he allows up to three hours before meetings. When cars cancel, he wheels himself to his destination. It's real exhausting, but at the same time we get a good cardio exercise, get to see the outside view as well. But he hopes soon, a van for him and his mates, will be just a click away. Ketki Masalamini News Hub. Even under the easing restrictions of the orange traffic light setting, our COVID cases are continuing to trend downwards. There were just under 6,000 new cases reported today, but there were another 10 deaths, taking the total number of deaths with COVID-19 to 586. Hospitalisations have jumped a little, 537 up from 500 yesterday, although that is partly down to underreporting by the Bay Plenty District Health Board yesterday. Twitter's board is fighting back after Elon Musk made a $63 billion offer in a possible hostile takeover. It's adopted a poison pill defence which would stop anyone owning more than 15% of the social media platform. Here's Channel 7's David Weywood. Fending off Elon Musk's $43 billion vision to rule the Twitterverse. Today, the social media giant hit reply. Adopping what's called a poison pill strategy. Twitter has put in place a poison pill. Poison pill. It means that if Musk's current 9% share of Twitter expands to 15%, the poison pill would kick in. A flood of shares would be released to stockholders at a discount, diluting Musk's influence. They are pulling up the drawbridge. They are strengthening their defenses against Elon Musk buying the company. The plan, unanimously by the board will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person, or group gains control of Twitter, as it was revealed at least one other private equity firm has also now expressed interest. From the billionaire today, a loving tweet to those supporting his hostile bid as others question the impact of a privately owned Twitter. I think it's really dangerous that so much of our communications are held in the hands of just a few people who run these platforms. Shareholders enjoying a bounce on the back of Musk's bombshell now waiting for the world's wealthiest man's next move. Is there a plan B? There is. Tim, people plan B? There is. Ten people have been shot and wounded at a mall in the United States. Police have detained three people who they believe are responsible for the attack. They say at least one of them fired a gun, but all three had weapons. Of the wounded, two are in a critical condition. Well, have you ever wanted to know the exact weather at your place? Well, farmers now can. MetService is partnering with a farm management company to provide the rural sector with pinpoint weather data they can access on a smartphone. Mitchell Alexander has the story. Andrew Horsborough started growing walnuts in Westmilton more than 20 years ago. Now he has 45 hectares worth of them. This time of year is harvest. So the walnuts drop, the trees drop their walnuts for about six weeks a year. We pick them up. To help get the best produce possible, he uses a sensor to get real-time data about his soil. We're fully irrigated and we determine when we irrigate according to when the CropX soil moisture sensor says that we should. And now METService is partnering with CROPX to combine their data and send pinpoint weather information straight to a farmer's phone. You can have in one day four seasons and that's quite hard to predict and to forecast. You need to have a speciality in this location. This piece of equipment will allow us to understand what is happening at and just below ground level. That includes moisture, temperature and also the conductivity between the senses, understand what's in the soil as well. It aims to help farmers make better decisions for their land and for the environment. We're using resources responsibly. We're not leaching any nutrients, and we've created the perfect conditions to optimise growth. MetService hopes that information will also help farmers respond to extreme weather. They could better predict what the impacts will be of a severe weather event and after the event they'll understand what has happened. Hunt says the tech could even be used in the future to provide a better understanding of the land in urban areas. Whether it's parks and gardens, whether it's electrical infrastructure and assets, gas, power, water, anything that matters on around the land. Land that can be better protected and managed. Mitchell Alexander, NewsHub. And staying with the weather theme, after a cold start for summer, it was a fairly settled day today, Mike. Yes, the Easter bunny must have been wearing gloves this morning, especially in the South Monopoldi, started with minus three. But it did find up for nearly everyone today, with Auckland reaching the day's high of 23 degrees. Now, if you are on holiday in Northland, there is a warning out for you. I'll have all the details after Super Sports Sunday. Thank you very much, Mike. While the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have started the opening of the Invictus Games, the peer paid special tribute to the Ukrainian athletes who left their war-torn country to compete. The Wided Upper Balloon Festival is back flying high for the first time since 2019, and businesses have had to pivot with COVID, and now as we open up, many in tourism, are pivoting again.

Thotiamaiano, welcome back. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made their grand entrance at this year's InVictus Games and the pair paid tribute to the Ukrainian team who left their war-torn nation to compete. The competition for injured servicemen and women is an event that's close to Prince Harry's heart. Here's ITV's Chris Ship. For Prince Harry, there is no cause closer to his heart than this. These's ITVs, Chris Schip. For Prince Harry, there is no cause closer to his heart than this. These in Victor's Games, for wounded and sick military and veterans, are two years late here in the Hague due to COVID. And when he and Megan went to the last tournament in 2019, they were still working members of the royal family. How times have changed. Both Harry and Megan attended the first event of the tournament, The Driving Challenge. He, in a big car, and both of them in a small one. But be in no doubt, whatever they've said and done since leaving the royal family, at this event they have nothing but praise for their founder. I just said a big thank you for what they do, because without people like them being the patrons of things like the Invitis Games Foundation, we wouldn't get this chance on this opportunity, not necessarily, to basically saving lives without knowing it. But different times mean different media arrangements. Netflix get priority access to the Sussexes these days. The streaming giant is, of course, paying them for future content. But the speech content at tonight's opening ceremony was very much about the present day and about the team from Ukraine, who made it here despite everything. For each team, my husband and I both recognize it's been a lot to get here, both physically and emotionally, not least a which for the Ukraine team, whom we are all standing with. Slavo Ukraini. They didn't bring their children here to the Netherlands, but Harry, who got a standing ovation here, spoke to the servicemen and women about their son, Archie. But what I remind him is that no matter what you want to be when you grow up, it's your character that matters most. And nothing would make his mum and me prouder than to see him have the character of what we see before us today. You. Well, back home now, the Wided Upper Balloon Festival is back on for the first time since 2019. COVID-19 restrictions over the past two years have halted the annual event. But as Alexa Cook reports, it was all action this morning. The Balloon Festival firing back into life. Brightly coloured balloons jostle for space on Martinborough's golf course, patiently waiting for take-off, attracting more than a thousand spectators of all ages. It's really cool, how high they go, and it's so fascinating. Oh, because that really big balloon, that strawberry balloon right there, is so funny. Is that your favourite? Yeah. there, it's so funny. Is that your favourite? Yeah. A spectacle that's been sorely missed during the pandemic. It feels therapeutic like never before. We just like seeing these. We've over from Wellington and haven't seen them for a few years. They come in all shapes and sizes, from large commercial ones that take a bit longer to inflate, to a balloon with no basket. Darren Redshaw just straps a gas bottle to his back. It's different being at like 4,000 feet and not seeing a basket around you, just seeing open air. She's a bit airy, but a little bit of getting used to, but yeah, good fun. It's a real family affair, his daughter giving him a fist bump before he glides up and away. Then it's our turn to take to the skies, gliding above the trees, the gas flame heating the air inside the balloon, causing it to rise, so we can follow the other 14 balloons ahead of us. Can't beat the views. I mean, wire-up is in a really nice place to fly because it's so open. This year's festival includes a sport ballooning competition, the first of its kind in New Zealand, with challenges like dropping a weighted tag onto a marker on the ground below, this pilot showing how it's done. We weren't quite so successful. I missed the target completely because obviously we're talking and I'm not focusing. Sorry. That's okay, that's fine. Luckily, that isn't his only reason for ballooning. The end of the day, it's the flying that's enjoyable part. And one of the most important things, of course, is the weather. Most hot air balloonists won't take off if the wind is higher than 10 kilometres an hour. So today is about 5Ks, which is perfect for flying. Mattingborough's quite famous for its box winds, which means we can actually take off, fly, go up, go around and come back down where we took off from, so the winds go in a circle. Giving you plenty of time to soak up the stunning views. Alexa Cook, News Hub. The big pandemic pivot saw businesses force to change the way they were to survive. Now we are past the peak and borders are reopening. Is it time to pivot back? Lucy Warhurst went to Funga Matar to meet one woman who's made changes for good. Katrina Miller is used to riding the waves, running a successful water sports tourism business for 17 years. Just before COVID, that last summer was amazing. Their surf and stay camps were packed. Board hires were wild. Then the pandemic hit. It was a wipeout. Everyone went away. Everything went. In the year after COVID hit, international tourism expenditure dropped more than 90%. That's a decline of $15 billion. It also saw the loss of more than 72,000 jobs. Stand-up paddle boarding, the estuary, kayaking, that sort of recreational activities stopped. Half of their bookings were from overseas tourists. There was still the domestic market, but when Auckland was in lockdown, she says they may as well have been in lockdown too. The toughest moment was after that first lockdown, we actually realised that we have to change our business. It's not going to work the way we are with COVID. They converted their shared accommodation to individual units and moved to online bookings and self-check-ins. They focused on guided kayak tours to Fenewakura Island to appeal to a wider group of people and families. It kept their heads above water, but they were worried about getting through this winter. It prompted her to carve out a new career in real estate. I've loved it. Yeah, it's really, really fun. It's quite similar to hosting people anyway and showing them around Fongamata and why we love living here, and now you can buy this house. Now she's seeing hires and bookings trickling back in, so she's pivoting back so she can do both real estate sales and the water sports. So we're quite excited about our winter ahead and with the borders opening, yeah, there should be some tours filling up hopefully. It's not only international tourists she needs, but qualified workers too. Summer-wise, yeah, it'll be on. I think we'll be on. So, staff, we need you. Helping her adopt a new business balance and stay prepared for the next wave. Lucy Warhurst, News Hub. Fantastic. Well, he's lit up the screen in over 120 movies. Now, Nicholas Cage is back in a role he's been rehearsing for his entire life. And caught on camera an alien visitor dropped in above Auckland this morning. Coming up on Super Sports Sunday were Wellington Phoenix fans rewarded as they poured into the club's first home game in more than 300 days. And All Black's coach Ian Foster reveals what he's focusing on as the 2022 international season approaches. I believe we have some power over who we love. I think the poets might disagree. I think you are just splendid. Tell her to make it short and spicy. I intend to make my own way in the world. No, no one makes their own way. Most of all the woman. The, no one makes their own way.

Brand new parental guidance. Wednesday at 730 on 3 and 3 now. News Hub Sport is brought to you by Suzuki, the team behind the Silver Ferns. Good evening and welcome to Super Sports Sunday, and we begin tonight with football and after more than 300 days the Wellington Phoenix finally played in front of home fans on home soil. COVID-19 forced the team to relocate to Australia to continue playing in the A-League and while the crown turned up they didn't get what they would have wanted. Natasha Payne watched the action. The yellow, the flags and the cheers are back. The Wellington Phoenix are the first Kiwi side who are based across the ditch to return home. And fans poured in to watch the first home game in 320 days. It's bloody awesome. We've been waiting for this for ages and hopefully it's an exciting afternoon for us and a big win. Counting down the sleep, so so excited. As the team took the field at Sky Stadium in front of almost 20,000 fans, it was obvious how much the crowd missed supporting their own, with Captain Ollie Sale taking a moment to realise how many people have always had their back. And the side rose to their expectations, fuelled by yellow fever. Within 21 minutes, they had seven shots on goal. But despite dominating position and territory, they failed to find the back of the net first. From one end to the other and Betty and Cololo silences the crowd here in Wellington. Things went from bad to worse in the second half, as the visitors silenced the crowd again. It's the post that ended up by Cummings. The merit again with ten minutes. The Merritt has doubled their money. And again. And it's found its way in for three. The Meriners have torn the script up on Easter Sunday. With ten minutes to play, the crowd slowly started to disappear and they managed to save themselves from further pain. And the cherry on top is applied. Coach Uphick Talley says it's a shame they couldn't give the crowd a different result. We missed them dearly. It was great to come back at home and play a game. Disappointed with the outcome. Despite the 4-0 loss, the Phoenix remain in fifth spot and in contention for the playoffs. Captain Olly Sayle no doubt hoping for a better result when they play Western Sydney at Eden Park next weekend. Natasha Payne News Hub. The Warriors have gone down 2214 to the roosters in Sydney to drop outside the NRL top eight. After trailing at halftime, the home site capitalised on their opportunities in the second spell and some controversial calls going against the Warriors. James Regan has the action. Going in some controversial calls going against the Warriors. James Regan has the action. Going in as heavy underdogs, the Warriors knew a good start would go a long way at the SCG. Poppy, man over, and the Warriors scored the first try as well. After sustained pressure, Edward Corsi crossed for his first try of the season as the Warriors surged to an 8-0 lead. But on a picture-perfect day, it was far from perfect footy, as both teams called. course he crossed for his first try of the season as the Warriors surged to an 8-0 lead. But on a picture perfect day, it was far from perfect footy as both teams coughed a mistakes in a grueling first half and it wasn't long before the roosters hit back. The Roosters, Tedesco holds it up, catch and pass to Bo in the corner. Warriors held on to finish on top in the first half, but they made a horror start to the second as Rees Walsh kicked out on the full. And Walsh powers this kickoff. It is going a mile. He's done that before already this season and he's done it again. And although they weren't controlling the game, the roosters nabbed the first of the second half. Martinis, a Lesniak State grounded and coughed it up. Try coming up here for Kevin Mangarva. And it wasn't long before they had another. Short side again. Walker, spinning his way through and Arthur's. But Nathan Brown's side didn't give up, pulling it back to 2014. Remarkable for Watanis Leesniak. The wing it fell over. Rees Walsh, that is wizardry. But some controversial calls by the bunker marred any chance of a comeback. That's a tough call. There's been some big moments for Nathan Brown to watch. As the roosters held on to end the Warriors winning streak. James Regan, Newsop. Highlanders Captain Aaron Smith is the latest event his frustration at the refereeing after his side fell to another defeat in Super Rugby, pips 2221 by the Hurricanes. The hosts lost Josh Dixon to a red card inside the opening 20 minutes for yet another shoulder to the head incident, the second of this round. But referee Angus Maybe didn't pull up Asafo Amoa for a similar collision late in the game, leaving Smith fuming. You know, we're getting robbed all the time and, you know, we had a red card for a contact of the head and one of our guys blatantly gets a black eye and touches and refs just walk it off like it's nothing. So all we want is consistency as players. The Highlanders nearly snatched victory on full time, but the TMO deemed there to be no clear grounding, leaving them in 10th on the Super Rugby ladder. All-Backs coach Ian Foster concedes they must find their best combinations this year following a disappointing 2021. Foster's been forced to use a number of different players in key positions during his tenure, but as the All-Blacks fall behind the rest of the world, he admits it's time to settle on his best team. 2021 was tough for Ian Foster. Three losses, including their final two games of the end of year tour, saw the All Blacks record their worst season in 12 years. Foster knows July series with Ireland will be a key measure of the lessons from last year's defeats. I love that. That's just a great challenge for us. And there's no better way to answer some questions and go and play them again. And when they do, Foster wants to use it to find his best combinations in key areas. He hasn't been able to do that since taking over in 2020, but with the World Cup 18 months away, there are several positions he wants to settle on this year. This year really is about trying to narrow down, and we know that we didn't have a lot of opportunity last year to build in-depth combinations. This year we'll be looking to do that more and more. The midfield remains a key area where Foster needs to decide on his best pairing, but it appears unlikely Geordie Barrett is part of it. This time last year, it was all about, you know, are you going to play a wing or fallback? And he said, well, everyone knows I want to be a fallback. And this year, he said he's quite happy to play 12. So he's a talented young man, isn't he, Olly? Are you saying you'd prefer him to focus on playing fullback? No, I just said I'm watching it with interest. Watching along with Foster will be new assistants, Mike Kron and Andrew Strawbridge, who have been brought in to bolster the current coaching group. It's an indication that we want to grow and improve. Is it a sign of panic? Well, I think I've probably already answered that. I clearly don't agree with that. I just think it's a matter of us showing that we want to find the answers. 2021 proved there's plenty of questions that need them. The All-Black Sevens will face Australia in the quarterfinals of the Vancouver Sevens, but only after a scare in their final pool game. Having already thumped Japan and Wales, New Zealand had to hold off a fast-finishing Salmohan side, 3124, despite the men in blue being down to six men for most of the game after an early red card. A nice chip. A beautiful bounce. Supreme Athleticism, Maliko. The All Black Sevens quarterfinal gets underway early tomorrow morning. The Southern Steel have toppled defending champions the Northern Mystics 6459 in a thrilling come from behind win in Invercargill. Despite trailing at half time, the steel gave the home crowd something to cheer about in the final quarter. A strong showing from the Steel's defensive unit proving the difference in the end. I think it was such a good team performance. Everyone stepped up when we needed to. We really held onto possession when we had to and I just thought it was such an awesome team performance. Everyone stepped up when we needed to. We really held onto a position when we had to, and I just thought it was such an awesome team performance. The win brings this deal to within two points of the mystics on the ladder. Still to come on Super Sports Sunday, goalkeeping blunders proved costly as Liverpool and Manchester City chase more silverware, plus the sporting moments of the week, including this win for the blues over the Crusaders, ending an 18-year drought. And later in news, we talked to Hollywood legend Nicholas Cage about his new movie where he quite literally plays himself. Hi everyone, wishing you all a very happy Easter from all of us here on AM.

Thursday, 7.30 on 3 and 3 now I think just like wait we can quit Welcome back It was a clash of the football titans In the first FAA Cup semi-final Liverpool are hoping to keep their hopes Of an unprecedented quadruple trophy season alive But standing in their way rivals Manchester City chasing a treble themselves ITV's Chris Scudder has the action. They piled down to Wembley from the northwest despite the lack of Easter trains, but made it to the big smoke by hook or by crook. You couldn't make it up, could you? It's all about money, isn't it? Not football. Typical of the FAA, the fan always comes last. They never listen to the fans needs. It's always money. Then again, what other stadium was big enough to house these two giants? Head and shoulders above any other, a bit like the giant Canate, whose mighty leap gave Liverpool the lead inside 10 minutes, and how the travelling cop army celebrated. Maybe they spooked City's goalkeeper Zach Stephan, whatever, it was hard to fathom what happened here. A nightmare moment for the American and Liverpool were 2-0. What an awful error by Zach Stefan. Then surely game over by half-time. Nightmare for City, total joy for Liverpool. City pulled one back early in the second half from Jack Greelish. And their second in the dying moments was too little, too late. Liverpool's day, but the two biggest prizes are still to be fought over the Premier League and Champions League. These two huge rivals are not done yet. Still at top of the league, one point. I mean, it's a cup competition at the end of the day. For success of semifinal, it is what it is. We keep going on. Where Liverpool, anything's possible, isn't it? It's all we can do. Take one game out of time. That's what you can do, in it, man. And what price clops Liverpool now winning one, two, three, four trophies in a remarkable season. After enjoying a career season, hurdler Portia Bing is now targeting higher honours. The former heptathlet broke the national 400 metre hurdles record three times this summer, just months out from two major events. Alex Chapman caught up with her. It's been a memorable few months for Portia Bing. What's clicked this summer? Obviously everything. And the results show it. Another national title. It's a straight sprint to the line for Porsche Bing. Dominant wins in Australia. But she's off the last hurdle. She's flying to the line. Let's step the clock. This's a straight sprint to the line for Porsche Bing. Dominant wins in Australia. But she's off the last hurdle. She's flying to the line. Let's step the clock. This is a fantastic run. Oh and just casually breaking the national record three times. The 29 year old putting it down to a greater focus on technique. We started working on the very, very small technical sides of things and something that I'd never done before. The former Heptathlet concedes going back to basics was a huge mental challenge. Her coach, leading sprint mentor James Mortimer, choosing to apply it to her job in the serious fraud office. You're working in patterns, you're thinking about rhythms, you're thinking about how little things fit within a larger picture, how does what you're doing fit in this big framework. And it was literally applying that kind of thinking into the hurdles so I could relearn. Spending time with sprinter Zoe Hobbs has also helped. I've been talking all season, how I've been beating her. So I've been learning a lot from her. And it's actually really interesting because I talk a big game about beating her over 100 metres and really holding her accountable. Bing's improvement comes at an ideal time with the world champs and Commonwealth Games in the next few months. There's something about being able to go to Commonwealth Games to me that's going to be a little bit different. Because for the first time in my life, I'm in a position as a senior athlete where I'm like, I could be making a final. I could actually almost medal. Like I'm in a position where I'm like, I could be making a final. I could actually almost medal. Like I'm in a position where I'm not there for participation. Bing's targeting a sub-55 seconds run. At Gold Coast 2018, that would have seen her medal. Another couple of hurdles, she's determined to overcome. Alex Chapman, Newsop. Finally tonight, what better way to celebrate the Easter holiday than over-indulging in chocolate and the sporting moments from throughout the week. Here's Lucy Thompson with the best from the last seven days. It's Easter and boy was it a good Friday for the Blues. Storming one from the captain. He's going to score. Eklund has a go for the line. Can he get down? Yes. It wasn't the hot cross buns they were munching on, but the sweet taste of success against the Crusaders in Christchurch for the first time since 2004. Blues turned under touch. And at long last, the trap is over. And it sparked an excellent reaction from coach Leon McDonald. Almost as good as the reaction from Carlos Spencer the last time Auckland prevailed over the hosts. And what an Easter week for Scotty Schifler, winning the Masters. Sheffler outshines them all. And while Orange You Glad crowds are back. I certainly am. And so was this overenthusiastic Daniel Ricardo fan at the Melbourne Grand Prix. In that area. All right, well, we've got to let this happen. Would it be a cross about Daniel Ricardo without a shooey? I don't think so. Easter is for chocolate, right? Let's hope for Iskabar's sake it doesn't contain nuts. Try to get him stepping off. The policeman just missed it. Everybody's laughing and smiling. That's the good part of this. At least he can smile about it, alongside the Blues, who finally had the last laugh in Christchurch. Yeah, I think we've probably seen enough of that Blues victory in Christchurch. Well done, I hope you've got some Easter eggs left today, Mitchie. Yeah, I think I do, but it's been a long weekend for a Crusaders fan like Arsoli. Certainly, mate. Well done with them. I hope you've got some Easter eggs left today, Mitchie. Yeah, I think I do, but it's been a long weekend for a crusaders fan like us, Ollie. Certainly, mate. Thank you very much. Well, actor Nicholas Cage has played some crazy characters over his long and illustrious career, but none crazier than his latest role. In the unbearable weight of massive talent, Nicholas Cage plays Nicholas Cage. Kate Rogers spoke to the Hollywood legend. Nicholas Cage. When he won his the Hollywood legend. Nicholas Cage. When he won his Oscar for the film Leaving Las Vegas, actor Nicholas Cage told us all something we already knew. Well, I know it's not hip to say it, but I just love acting. And so he does. It's a love that's translated to over a hundred movies. And in that time, he's delivered us so many a memorable character. Cameron Poe in Conair. I said put the bunny back in the box. Stanley Goodspeed in The Rock. Listen, I'm just a biochemist. I drive a Volvo. Page one. So what do you say you cut me? I said in friggin' slack. Castor Troy in face-off. But now a face-off of a different kind, one with himself. Nick Cage. Yep, in his latest film, the unbearable weight of massive talent, Nick Cage, plays Nick Cage. I know you've had your share of dumb questions, so this is probably one of them. Is it easier or harder to play a version of yourself than another character? Oh, it's much easier to play another character. Because when you're playing another character with somebody else's name, you can hide behind that character, and it's not all on you, and you're not potentially embarrassing your family, hopefully. But when you play Nick Cage, there's a lot of other cages running around, and I don't want to humiliate them anymore than I want to humiliate myself. For the record, there is no humiliation in sight. It turns out that Nick Cage, the movie, is just what we all need right now, the film, quietly sitting at 100% on rotten tomatoes. But seriously, how crazy was this idea? Was it, in fact, as crazy as my lunatic cat cavorting in the back of our interview? I suspect over the years you've had some batshit crazy bonkers script ideas cross your path. Would this be kind of up there when it comes to surprising ideas? Oh yeah. This would be the most bonkers as you so well put concept for a movie. I think it was thoroughly daunting and challenging and there was no muscle in my body that told me I should play a character named Nick Cage in a movie. It just scared everything out of me and I said no about four times. Then the little known writer-director Tom Gormacken sat down and he wrote his hero a letter. It was a good letter, it was an intelligent letter, it was sensitive, and I knew he was a genuine film enthusiast, and he also wanted to make a movie about people, not cartoons. What did he say? He says he loves you, but he went in a different direction. Cage plays a version of himself, a movie star falling on harder times, who agrees for a million bucks to attend the birthday party of a Spanish superfan, Harvey. But Harvey is being stalked by the CIA and suddenly all of Cage's many roles get to play out in real life. Well, kind of real life. It is quite literally the role Nicholas Cage was born to play out in real life. Well, kind of real life. It is, quite literally, the role Nicholas Cage was born to play. And he did it for his fans. I've been blessed with a loyal group of fans or film enthusiasts that have stuck with me because I think they know that we're going to have that relationship. Like I have when I would watch my heroes like Marlon Brando. I would be like, I know you. I know what you're feeling because he was sincere. And I think that with this movie, we have it again. The unbearable weight. But the unbearable weight of massive talent is almost over. The film opens in cinemas next week. Kate Roger, Newsup. An Auckland man got a surprise when he checked his security camera footage this morning. The motion-triggered system captured a streaking light, probably a meteor in the skies to the east of his Gulflands home in Auckland. The brief burst of light shot across the sky just after 5 past 5 this morning and disappeared into the atmosphere. There are reports of sightings all over the Upper North Islands.

More stars will take to the stage this weekend, including Billy Elish and Megan the Stallion. Well, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. is celebrating its most famous residents. It's been 50 years since pandas arrived at the zoo, and they each received a fruity ice block cake to mark the occasion. The pandas are part of a conservation effort with China. They were a gift from the Chinese Premier to then-First Lady Pat Nixon, and they've been delighting crowds ever since. Well, to recap of our top stories tonight.

At Meridian, we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Kiyoda, good evening. Hope you've had a great Easter Sunday. The weather has certainly been playing its part, but holiday makers in the north may have to change plans as this big blob of blue arrives in Northland, marking the start of a few wet days for the Upper North Island. However, Tewai Purnamu stays fine under a ridge of high pressure, but a few showers making their way into Fjordland. So let's see how it all plays out. There's a bit cloud around tonight for the South Island with the north-east flow that does produce a few showers over Fjordland. So let's see how it all plays out.

Now those showers will hang around for Sunday, but it's fine for everyone else with a few light sea breezes. It should stay fine in the south till about Wednesday. And the North Island now, Northland, under a heavy rain warning from midnight tonight with heavy falls expected. Now you can see all that rain. That's it there in the blue. It's going to spread south tomorrow, bringing rain to places Topal North. It's mainly fine for everyone else, however, with a few showers for Hawks Bay and Gisbon. Let's take a closer look now. That rain definitely making its presence felt for northern areas. Along with the rain, there's thunderstorms and some strong easterly winds. That rain will hit Hamilton in the afternoon. Further south, it's a mainly cloudy Easter Monday with some easterlees, but occasional rain develops in the afternoon. Highs here between 18 and 21. And in the east, Masterton, you escape the cloud and the showers to have a mainly fine day, but frequent showers will make their way into Hawks Bay and Gisbon. And for the rest of the North Island, look at you loads of sunshine for the day off, especially south of Huang Canui. Tomonanui, you may get rain late at night with showers edging their way into Taranaki. Over the straight, that ridge of high pressure really helping with the school holidays, plenty of sunshine here, highs of around 19, 20 degrees. And across Highway 73, it's a fairly similar pattern for the east. Any cloud or fog lifts for a sun-filled afternoon, highs here floating between 17 and 20. And for southern Alteiro, a bit of fog possible for Queenstown and Invercagel also open, but it does fine up with a few northerly's highs here between 16 and 19. Not too bad at all. Hello, Daneda, not a bad Monday for you. There's some cloud around if you're up early, but the sun dominates the afternoon. Moskew down to just one tonight. A chilly night also for Christchurch and Rangiora with a bit of cloud when you wake. It finds up, though, with a high of 17. Add the wind, though, dressed for a high of 12. Wellington's looking like the place to be for Easter Monday. South Easterlies die out in the afternoon. The sun's out all day, highs's here reaching 19-21 degrees. And Kiyoda Hawks Bay, a few showers around for your Easter Monday with the north-easterly. Highs here around 18-19 degrees. Not too bad for the rest of the week either.

That will be strong and exposed places, high sea around 21, 22. Let's go overseas now. A few shouts for Hobart and Adelaide with rain for Melbourne. The rest of Australia, however, staying fine. And in the Pacific Islands, not too bad, actually, with lots of fine weather and just a sprinkling of showers for Vanuatu and Samoa. Back here now, and not what the north needs for the school holidays. Rain or showers were pretty much everyone here. It is expected to clear on Friday. Further south, it's a wet week ahead for you too, but a slight break from the showers for Gisbon and Hawks Bay. That'll happen on Wednesday. New Plymouth has a showery week with rain arriving Thursday for the Wellington area.
