Have you ever seen a motorcycle chariot? Come on, though! Oh my God! And we're gonna to make Kevin swim home from prison. The Alcatraz swim? Without a wetsuit. Make it happen, bro. Swim! Your stock is going to go up in my book. Whether you make it or not. It's all dangerous. So do us a favor. Don't do it at home. Yeah! It's all dangerous, so do us a favor. Don't do it at home. Holy shit. I'm Kevin Moore. I'm Grant Reynolds. There it goes. We met years ago and realized we both like bikes, blowing stuff up, and taking fields to the extreme. And now we want to outbuild. Jabang! Out-a-boom. And out-science. The world's most crazy viral videos. Watch this. Oh, oh, no. What could possibly go wrong? We're not stopping! Oh, yeah, bro! Okay, pay close attention. Oh, look at that. Oh, right into the car. That's brutal. Yeah, dude. I'm taking the donkey and I'm going down to the docks. That's actually horse chariot racing. Oh, my God, did you see that? Oh, that guy got a little mechanical failure on that one. Whoa, look it! Oh! That thing's just straight pissed off, out of control. That's where they get the term, quit horsing around. It's unpredictable because it's a horse with its own mind, even though it's trained, can do whatever it wants. We can do this better and safer. What if we replaced that with something that was completely under our control? Motorcycle. A motorcycle. Let me push pause for a second. Have you ever seen a motorcycle chariot? I've never seen somebody ride a motorcycle and not be on it. Look, I think we could do it. Make chariots with motorcycles. I think the biggest obstacle is how to control the motorcycle. We can find a way to steer a motorcycle and not be on it. Look, I think we could do it. Make chariots with motorcycles. I think the biggest obstacle is how to control the motorcycle. We can find a way to steer it. We have to be able to manipulate and articulate the power of the motorcycle. From the chariot, we should be able to smoke all of these horse-drawn carriages. A horse-drawn carriage goes about 20 miles an hour. About that's fast. So I think we need to go faster than that. So we need goes about 20 miles an hour. About that's fast. So I think we need to go faster than that. So we need to go 21 miles an hour. And race them a la Ben-er. That's the goal. I think we can do that. So we'll get some bikes. Yeah, let's go. We need motorcycles for our chariots. This is a guy that's got all kinds of lean, sailed type stuff. It'd be neat to have one with a bigger motorcycle with a big displacement motor, and then do something with like these and do two small ones. So imagine it's like a big Clydesdale versus two ponies. Yeah. And see what happens. See, that's good there. Like that little Suzuki in the corner, but it's got no top end. That's what I learned to ride on. That thing will run forever. Silly looking, Mike. I'll do two smaller, you know, like smaller bikes. I think I'm going to do like a cheap street bike. What about this? You could cruise in style. This would be the Clydesdale of motorcycle chariots. I don't know if I want Clydesdale as much as I want a quarter horse, a race pump. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. I think I found mine. That's perfect. Not too big, not too small. You look like Arthur Franzarelli. I feel like Arthur Arthur Franzarelli. I feel like Arthur Fonzorelli. Wow, that's a horn. So you're going to do the two ponies, and I'm going to do the quarter horse. I'm going to go see how much this thing is. All right, let's go build some chariots. Cool. All right. I'm using two small motorcycles for my chariot designer. I'm going to weld together a metal frame to hold them with the chariot. It comes together. Done. For steering and gas, I'm going to use a remote control system that I can operate from inside the chariot. I'm using a remote control and servoes from an old airplane project we did so I can steer and control the gas from inside the chariot. You're going to what? Radio control? Yeah. The chariot motorcycle. So I can, what? Radio control? Yeah. So I can... So I can sit back and enjoy myself a cold one while you're sweating in the pits. Ben Hur would laugh at you. I got a really good idea what I'm going to do. I'm going to hook up my chariot to the struts of the motorcycle. I'm going to fabricate a hand shifter and a clutch, and I'll also have a foot pedal inside of the chariot. That way I can control the motorcycle without even having to be on it. All right, I'm going to move her mics because I know he's got a trailer. Yo, Mike! Mike, thank you, buddy. That's nice and pretty. Oh, that's nice and pretty. Oh, yeah. I'm going to attach metal rods where the handlebars used to be on the motorcycles and attach linkage. That way, I can steer both of them in unison. And I go right and I can go left. And I can mount it off of this pedestal right there. I'm going to do a couple quick zip-zaps with this bugger. All right, that'll hold for that. This crossbar will connect to my steering server. All right, we're good. This thing is dialed. All I have to do now is figure out how to manipulate the clutch, the shifter, and then the back brake. So man, I am halfway home. Halfway to the Victory Circle. See that? No hands, baby. All remote control. There's no way. All I have to say is this. Holy Chicago. Let's just go shake them down. I want to make sure mine works. Tally-ho! All right. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Yeah, I'm not gonna make that. That's not remote steering. I'm stuck. Do you need a chariot to come help you get out? It's gonna be a problem. What are you thinking? So you saw what happened with my remote control setup. It didn't work out quite the way I wanted. So now I'm gonna go all mechanical linkages. Like that. Look at that. Simple always works. It's like every good beetle song you ever heard. I've got my hand clutch, hand shift, and then my brake is right here. Simple mechanical linkage. So now all I have to do is finish up the remainder of my mechanical linkage so I can actually steer this bad boy. But that's a little trick up my sleeve. So I'm ready. You ready? I'm done. I'm ready to go. Motorcycle chariot. Here we come. So Kevin and I built two different motorcycle chariots with the goal being to beat 20 miles an hour. That's the average speed of a normal horse and a chariot. We'll see if he makes it. Here we go. All right, you want to start with the speed test? You want to go first? Do you want to go second? I'll go first. All right. Come on, Bill. 20 miles an hour. Ah! Oh, oh, oh. Oh, my God. Give me right here. Yeah! Yeah, girl, yeah! Oh!

Ten men will bear it all. Confidence is always key. In this heartwarming series, finding magic mic, and... The Reve-Belows to the Ray. Divorce turns cop in this action-packed drama. We hear a boom. We get out of there immediately. Got it. Nathan Phillyen stars as The Rookie. All this and so much more. Are you not to change? Stream on three now. Kevin and I built two different motorcycle chariots, with the goal being to beat 20 miles an hour. Come on, Bill. 20 miles an hour. Dude, slow down! Oh my god! Dude, you go slow down, you go right! Oh, oh! Oh my god! P-ha-ha! Please tell me you didn't hit a bike! Well, thankfully it was the pole and nothing else. Oh, you picked the perfect thing to hit. From back there, it looked like you were going through the window. The brakes didn't work. I was standing on the back brake, and I was holding the front brake. It looks like one of the bolts on the brake caliber mount came out, and that's why I couldn't stop. I think I can fix it pretty quick. Let's do it. What could possibly go wrong? All right, here we go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ah. I had 15. Damn it. All right, gallant effort, man. Let me give mine a try. All right, you ready? Yep. Come on, girl. Make me proud. Three, two, one, go. Go. Go. Go. Go! Go! Go! I don't like what's happening right now. What's wrong? My throttle seems to be flooding every time I try to shift into second gear. Try it again. Come on, you stubborn old mule. Do me right here. Yeah! Oh! Oh! Yeah, girl! Yeah! 23! You got it! 23! Yes! And I tell you what, I think if you had more of a runway, you could have done faster. That's maybe a hundred yards at most? Maybe. Yeah, not bad. I'm having trouble getting into second. I didn't even mess around. That's 23 in first gear. Then that's gold. I think it's clear that yours is faster than mine. Mine is better at steering when the brakes don't fail and I run into a pole. So I don't know, we'll see. You know, is it going to be going the fastest or is it being the most controlled? We won't know until we race. It's going to be interesting to see what happens. Dude, there's a grass field right behind the shot. Let's just take the chariots there and go race. What do I think? Right about here? Yeah. One, two, three laps, and on the third lap coming through the cones, that is the finish line. Whoever makes it through the cones first on the third lap is the victor. That's it. Isn't that how chariots do it? Two men enter, one man leave. Yeah, just like the gladiators. We're gladiators here. Let's race! Are you not please? So here's the secret that Grant doesn't know is I actually put in a pivot bolt in the middle of mine so that it turns really well. I'm all about agility. That's what wins the race. Horse frames, we're steering? Absolutely. I'm all about agility. That's what wins the race. Horse reins, we're steering? Absolutely. I'm going old school, brother. Ben Hirsch style. Three, two, one, go. Go, baby, go. Yeah! Yeah! Woo! Take this, Kraz, Reddams! Oh! Damn! Oh! Damn, my throttle cable came out. Ha-ha, sucker! One lap, baby, one lot! Oh, boy. Yeah, come on, you! Ah! Sayonara! Okay, here we go. Oh, dude, it's stuck, it's stuck! Dude, it's stuck! Yeah! Oh, you know, buddy! How you doing, buddy? Prepping myself for a cold water swim from Alcatraz.

Yeah, come on, Mule! Yeah! My throttle's stuck, my throttle! Dude, it's stuck! Holy. You okay? Oh my god. Are you okay? Are you all right? Yeah. Okay, okay. Here. The throttle got stuck, man. That was what I was worried about. Do you want you all right? Yeah. Okay, okay. Here- The throttle got stuck, man. That was what I was worried about. Do you want to get up? Yeah. I think I'm already going into shock, man. Are you all right? Do you need to be up here? No. I think we're okay, bud. I can't focus, man. I just, I can't reel it in. Ah. That hurts so bad. Ugh. Ugh. Do you need mouth to mouth? Dude, you nailed that fence. I mean, I didn't even see it. I didn't see it here, apparently. But you're okay, right? Yeah. When I came through the first time, I died over here because the throttle cable came unseated. Then I tightened it down really tight, and I tied it too tight, so when I stepped on it over there, my throttle got stuck, I came through here full throttle, man. Ah! That's my bone. No, for real? Oh, God. That hurts, man. It hurts so bad I can't even focus. Just to be clear, you're not doing this to, like, take away from my victory, are you? Oh, you won fair and square. I know, it's not a fun victory when you see your buddy get hurt. I think the result is clear. I went for steerability. You went for speed. If we were drag racing straightaway, this would win every time. Oh, it goes really fast. And you could get your groceries in it very well. Yeah. Mine is made for, you know, doing little donuts and stuff, and it works. But on a straightaway, I ran it into the motorcycle shop. However, we did accomplish our goal, man. We'd be 20 miles now. We'd meet 20 miles now. This was just fun. That went south really fast. I've got to get a new pair of jeans and I got to go nurse this bed, boy. Son of a gun. What could possibly go wrong? I'll tell you what. That could go nurse this bad boy. Son of a gun. What could possibly go wrong? I'll say what? That could go wrong. All right, well, we proved that these are as fast as a horse-drawn chariot. And you know what else? They're equally as dangerous. Dude, absolutely. You ready for this? What the hell is this? Go! Oh! Oh, ha ha ha ha. Oh, it's pretty good. Oh, look, these guys are swimming in cold water. That's pretty good. Little polar bear challenge. See, that's all initial shock. Once you get used to the water, stay in there for a while. You can't stay in cold water too long, man. I think that there's variability in people's physiology that allows some people to be better in cold than other people. I can go into the Pacific without a wetsuit. The water's 55 degrees, so I can spend an hour, hour and a half in it, and I'm not that cold. I don't know if you've ever had hypothermia before, but it's brutal. I don't know, man. Alcatraz is right over here. It's like a mile and a quarter straight to the city. People do swim it. Well, they're wearing wetsuits. I think the dudes that swam it. The dudes that escaped in the early 60. Yeah, I think they made it. I think at least some of them made it. There were three of them. They're like 85 now, sipping drinks going, ha ha ha, the world thinks I'm dead. I could do that swim. You could do ha, the world thinks I'm dead. I could do that swim. You could do that, the Alcatraz swim? Without a wetsuit. Without a wetsuit. Absolutely. I am a man of great heat. I think that if you're thoughtful about it and you get access to whatever you could have in a jail. Materials only found in 1960s era prison, Alcatraz. That you could outfit yourself enough to make that swim. What are you gonna outfit yourself with? Anything in a prison. I think lunch trays, duct tape, swimming goggles. So you got mid-50s water for at least an hour when you get hypothermia, when that body core temperature dives and plummets like that, all your blood goes right to your heart to keep the heart warm. So your extremities just get no blood supply. This is dangerous, man. Why don't you come with me, build a raft, because those guys did it out of like raincoats or something. But it doesn't matter if I make it or not. My whole goal is to monitor you. Exactly. All right, man. Well, let's do this. Let's make a bet. Gladly. The bet is you can make the swim. I say no, you say yet. Yeah, yeah. What do you want a bet? Dignity. Dignity? Whoever loses has to run down my street naked. Naked 100-yard dash. Okay. I'm telling you right now, I've done some stupid stuff in my life. You would not catch me doing this one. Let's do it. All right, man. Keeping warm during my swim from Alcatraz is going to be crucial for my success. But since it's a prison break, I'm going to have to be extra resourceful. Some of the things I'm using, obviously, is this duct tape to make a duct tape hat. It's going to keep my head in my head warm. Keep some of the heat in, because mostly your heat you lose is from your head. Turning some old welding goggles into swimming goggles. And then I'm gonna take some trays and I'm gonna turn them into fins. These are gonna be fins? I'm really worried. It makes me feel better. Okay, so hopefully I can cover this thing up well enough to where Kevin won't see that I actually have a pontoon inside up there, and I'm blatantly cheating. Almost there, man. I'm just... A pontoon? No, man, they have pontoons in prison. Come on, they had to float mail over there and food. To put on those big ass trays that you used to eat, cheater. Get back to building your cheat boat. To go. Keep all that heat in my head. Keep all that heat in my head. The number one place you lose heat from, your head. Oh my God. Come on, baby. There's only about this much thin on the end, about six, seven inches. And that's good because then when I'm swimming, my feet will match the stroke of my arms. Oh! All day, every day. You could see how simple it is in nature. All it's going to do is turn this little prop back here. The rudder, super simple. Left rudder, right rudder. Did I cheat? Hell, yes, I cheated. Am I going to get off the rock? You're damn right, I'm going to get off the rock. Wow. That may be the most elaborate thing ever built right under the eyes of everyone in the prison system. That's all right. It is. That's pretty cool. I'm done. Before I go jumping into the bay, we're going to perform a baseline test to see how my core body temperature holds up to an ice water bath. 55 is what you want to? 55. Well, the bay fluctuates from 55 to 60, so let's go on the low end. I've got 54 degrees in here right now. God, Hughes outside. What is he going to think of me right now? You! How are you doing? Prepping myself for a cold water swim from Alcatraz. Oh, woo-hoo! That's cold! Wow, that's cold! Wow, that's cold! I want to see what your body core temperature is. 98.6 is normal, right? Yeah. 97.6. You've only been in there a few minutes, and your core temp is already dropping. What are you going to be looking for for signs of hypothermia? Bro, I'm going to see your lips are going to be very blue. You're going to be trying to do things, and your body will not respond. You're going to have uncontrollable shit. Trust me, we'll know when to get you out. All right. I am worried about you, man. That's why I'm not doing it. All right. You have to get up real early. You need to be in the water at six. It's important to get slack tide. When the tide is coming in and it stops, pauses for a bit before it goes back out. When there's the least amount of currents going through the water, that's going to enable me to do it. All right, I'm ready when you are. Ooh, cold? Yeah. That's Alcatraz right there. I know. That doesn't look very far. It looks close, but it isn't. Your ass looks twice as big in that bathing suit. Dude, make it happen, bro. Make it happen. Swim! Game on. I was air hockey champ, South Philadelphia. You were nine. Suck it, Grand Reynolds! Yeah! Let's go, boys. Come on. How all black legends fought their way back to fitness. Yeah! Done it!

Kevin and I just got down here. We just charted a boat. It's time to do this. This is a no-joke deal right now. We probably got about a 20-minute ride to get out there to the island. Kevin's sitting here getting ready. Getting on his fins right now. It's going through your mind, buddy. Swim, swim, swim, swim. Oh, oh, oh, I have a wetsuit on and that's cold. Alcatraz. You nervous, man? I just want to get in the water and go. So where are you planning on ending up? I'm going to end up right about that white building right there. The square one, the low three-story one? Yeah. I'm thinking this swim is going to take me about 90 minutes. That's the plan. We'll see what happens. Plans don't always go the way you think. Let me get your core town. Good. 98.6. Bingo. You're ready, bro. I can tell you're ready. Your stock is going to go up in my book. Whether you make it or not. Your ass looks twice as big in that bathing suit. Dude, make it happen, bro. Make it happen. Swim! You got this, bro! I got to get my boat in water. I'm coming for you, baby! Oh, this sucks. This sucks right out of the gate. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Now the paddle system isn't even working. How am I doing? Keep it up, baby. Don't stop moving. Mayday, Mayday, May day. Hey, Skipper, this is a fat idea. Yeah, man, I stripped the gear. My boat, total fail. Skipper, take me over to Kevin. Oh, he's got his eyes closed. Right about now, he's probably feeling the effects of this 54-degree water. Hypothermia, you know, I said it to him when we were looking at those videos. The only thing that your body is trying to protect is the heart. I'm starting to hear some panting. Every time he gets on his back, he completely loses his landmarks, which are going to help him get to shore faster. Like right now, he's swimming towards a Golden Gate Bridge. We want nothing to do with the Golden Gate Bridge. He just goes right out to the ocean. We want nothing to do with that. Kevin's totally fatigued. I can't even imagine how cold he is right now. I don't feel like I'm getting closer. You hit the halfway mark. Yeah, so look how far he's come. You can see Alcatraz right there. There's the rock. But look how far he's got to go. I'm going to escape this deal, prison. I don't know about this. He's going the wrong way. He's swimming in circles. He's just looking tired. This is terrible. I don't know. I don't think he's going to make it. I hate the ocean. All right, here we go, game on! You ready to play the biggest game of air hockey ever? Oh! Oh! Goo! Clutter causes anxiety and stress. Wow.

I think we can use science to make it even more gnarly. You know, I've always wanted to make one that was bigger. A really big air hockey table. What, a supersized air hockey table? Giant air hockey table. How big are you talking about? 12 by 24. I can't even say it. Feet? You want to go 12 feet by 24 feet? That way we can stand on it and play. You want to play on the world's biggest air hockey table. That's what I'm hearing. You might be on to something. You could make it just like a regular one where the air is coming up from underneath to lift the puck. We just need to lift enough of the mass of the puck, so it's floating. And most of the weight is taken off the puck sitting on the table so that it can move easily. It's move very easily. I'm in, dude. I like it. I think that if we can build a large enough table that we can stand on and find a way to create enough air pressure to lift a giant puck, we should be able to play the world's biggest, largest game of air hockey ever. That's no R-A. No R on the end. E-V-A. Ever. What else do you have to do today? Nothing. Let's go. I want to do it. Just on that alone, E-V-A, ever. What else do you have to do today? Nothing, let's go. Let's go. I want to do it. Just on that alone, I want to do it. Pegboard? That looks like the top of a air hockey. Well, that's what the top is, is Masonite. Reach back behind there as a fan. Let's see if we can set this bugger up. I have an idea of how we're going to build our giant air hockey table. But first, we're going to prototype it with some pegboard and fans. And if that works, we'll scale it up. That should work as a good part. Oh, dude. That actually lifts off. All day. Oh, that's good. We have our design. Box fan with pegboard. We're going to use nine four by eight sheets and bolt them together and put fans underneath and put the whole thing on saw horses so we can stand on our giant air hockey table. What the hell did you have for breakfast, man? Are we going to go after each other here? Got to come up with names for your team and everything? Oh, yeah. The periodic table of elements. Arsenic would be good for you. There it is. Arsenic. You're going to be a poison. I'll be a noble gas. I'm going to go with xenon. Arsenic against xenon. Yep. Arsenic. You're going to be a poison. I'll be a noble gas. I'm going to go with xenon. Arsenic against xenon. Yep, arsenic against xenon. We're going to need a ton of pegboard, and we're going to need three billion fans. Let's go build this thing. All right, let's do it, man. I'm excited. You know, you probably could have held one more. We searched Craigslist for some used fans and found a ton. Now we're going to get cracking on this build. Perfect. That's one of 20 trips. Oh, God. So, yeah, this can be the bottom. We'll have to cut out holes for the fans. Bingo. That looks great. All right, man, one down, 44 more to go. We'll just have one master switch that you have to put a quarter into. One, two, three. Keep going with it. There we go. Nice. Ooh, oh, yeah, that works well. Dude, that is so primo. We've got the table all figured out. Now it's time to make some pucks. All different shapes, sizes, so we can see which one of these pucks floats the best. Hey, Grant, there you go. Check that out. I'll put some tape around it. Puck. I think that's pretty good. Why don't I just go grip my truck? Let's bring them down in the end of the street. Yeah. There's go. There's going to go. This looks pretty flat right here. This looks pretty flat right here. Ah, okay. That's got to come to the game. Is that where we're going to charge? 25 cents? 25 cents. All right, here we go. Air hockey tables all set up. So now we have a couple of pups we're going to try it. My favorite so far, it's got a little tiny lip right there so it can collect some air. Got a nice weight to it too. Here's another version of just the styrofoam completely wrapped in duct tape. And then here's another version of that duct tape one. And we've put some washers all the way around the upper perimeter of it to weight it down. And hopefully that keeps it on the table. Let's fire up the Jenny, make sure they're all working, and test out our pucks. All right, here we go, man. I hope this works. I can hear them. These fans are on. These are on. I think we're good to go. We ended up with 45 fans on our giant air hockey table. Hopefully that'll give us enough lifts, so our homemade pucks will move. Fingers crossed. Let's look at these pucks really fast. My bet is on the blue one. Wow. Nice. That was pretty good. Look at that. Look at the air pushing up the puck. Spectacular. Okay. Wow. It's too light. Wow. It's too light. Wow. Here, hold on. Do it like this. Ah. This one's got the weight. It does. It's nice. I think that's the one. Let's try putting a few more washers on that bugger. Yeah. Why don't we give that a shot? The arsenics against the Zinons. Noble gases. Poison. All right, what do you say? Let against the xenons. Noble gases, poison. All right, what do you say? Let's play to three. OK, but loser has to clean up all this crap. OK. You sure? Yeah. All right. All right, little known fact, 1983. I was Air Hockey champ at the Regal Bowling Alley in South Philadelphia. I have a reputation to keep. I got to beat Grant. All right, here we go. Game on. Are you ready, man? You ready to play the biggest game of air hockey ever? Game on. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Coming in, high. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, ooh. All right, here we go. Game on. You ready to play the biggest game of air hockey ever? Game on! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh! Two nothing. Yeah! Yeah! Score one for Xenon! Is the puck dead? This one's dead. Who! Is the puck dead? This one's dead. Whew. Yeah, that'll work. All right, man. Game point. I make it. I win. You clean up all the shit. I gotta tell you, 1983, I was Air Hockey champ, South Philadelphia. You are nine! On the main line! I was! I was! I was. I'm coming in hot. Coming in hot. Ah! Ah! Ah! You got to clean. You got to clean all this crap. Dye! Good game. Look at the siren went off. Good game. So we wanted to build an air hockey table that was strong enough to hold both of us and had enough airlift to move a puck around so we could play basically a human, giant-sized game of air hockey. So I think after having watched all of those viral videos, we made a bigger, better, and way cooler air hockey table. That was some very cool garage engineering right there. This might be the world's largest air hockey table. That was some very cool garage engineering right there. This might be the world's largest air hockey table. And to you, sir, I award the Stanley Can. The Stanley Can. Good work. Ah! The best part about making the Alcatraz swim is watching old numnuts here run down my street naked. Ha ha ha ha ha! Woo! That's funny, we're going to have."}
