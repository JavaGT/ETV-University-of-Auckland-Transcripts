Introducing the TiVo instant indoor outdoor heater. It's designed to be the fastest, warmest heater you'll ever own. Standard outdoor heaters could take forever the warmer and could cost you a fortune in gas, but not the TiVo heater. The secret is the TiVo heater's carbon fiber bulb technology. It produces radiant heat rays that heat you directly, and you won't believe the cost savings. This standard outdoor gas heater costs around $3.50 per out of run. But the energy efficient TiVo instant indoor outdoor heater with its built-in motion sensor only costs around 40 cents per hour to run. That's a saving of around $3.10 per hour. And it never runs out of gas at the wrong time. Plus it's 100% weatherproof, so it's not affected by rain or wind. In a standardized wind test with a 15 kilobes in hour breeze, the TiVo heater measures a full 10 degrees warmer than the outdoor gas heater, even in real-life conditions. And when it gets really cold, you can take it indoors to create summer in your bedroom or your bathroom. Tebow heater is an affordable and efficient way to heat your entire home with its built-in motion sensor that automatically shuts off when you leave one room and turns on when you enter another.
