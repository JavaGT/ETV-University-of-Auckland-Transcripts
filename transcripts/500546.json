No, there's been a lot of attention in the media lately about people with mental illness being dangerous. But actually research shows they're very safe to be around. If they are going to harm someone, it's usually themselves. So it's really important that we don't fear people with mental illness, that we give them understanding and the support they need. What is the right way to deal with someone with a mental illness? Often people worry that they've got to say the right things, but actually, in a lot of times, there's not a right thing that you can say. What you can do is listening, and listening is not giving advice, it's not necessarily trying to solve the problem, it's not even trying to make everything better instantly. It's just really listening to what the person has to say, spending that time with the person to show that you care about them."}
