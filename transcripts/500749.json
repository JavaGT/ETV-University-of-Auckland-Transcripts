And I'm Laura Tupo. And now on the project, you're trying to find a lost piece of art? Yes, we are Laura Tupo. Nice to see you back on the tally. You look good, girl. And yes, we are. We're trying to find a very special piece of Wanganui woman, who was really hoping to get it back. 63 years ago, Eunice Jeffers took all her clothes off in the name of art. She posed for an artist who created the piece titled Naked Lady on Bed. And Eunice kept it for many, many years. But the artwork was lost a couple of years ago, and now she and her family are desperate to find it. Well, joining us now from Wanganui is Eunice and her husband, Robert. Eunice, how did this beautiful painting get away from you? Our eldest daughter decided that she would like it and as she was the eldest, we thought it should go to her. And she had a garage sale two or three years ago when they were moving and I don't know if it inadvertently got sold or quite what the story was are you sure your daughter actually liked the painting or is she just actually taking an opportunity to get rid of it somewhere? I don't know but I do think that maybe it was taken off as the wall because the grandchildren, her grandchildren maybe have been asking questions about the nude lady that was on the wall. Seems like a pretty brave thing to do in 1950s Canada, was it? No, I don't think so. He was a friend. He was an art teacher. His wife was in the house with the children when the painting was being done. And she'd pop into the room to make sure I got breaks. I wasn't taken aback by it. I thought, oh, fair enough. He wants to paint you, let her go ahead and paint her. We'll hang it on the wall and that'll be it. And have you done any other life modelling? I did posing for the night classes while Bob was at home looking after our eldest. It was a job. And I was paid for it. And we were broke. We didn't have much money. It's based on a famous painting, isn't it, Robert? Yes, I think he probably based it on the Goya's nude, I believe. It's very similar. You didn't offer Robert to pose as well, maybe get the two-for-one deal? No, that wouldn't have been me at all. I would have refused point-blank to do that. Wow. Because I would have considered that. My private is my private life, so too bad. What would it mean to you to get it back, to have it back? Elated. I think it would be absolutely marvelous to have it back and to be able to hang it on the wall. I really hope that you get it back in your possession soon. Her friend did say that she thought I was very brave to do such a thing, but I feel braver now trying to do this interview. Well, you're awesome. It's been lovely to speak with you. Thank you very much. Okay, you're welcome. Thanks again. Thanks very much. Okay, welcome along to the project, and Laura Daniel is here. Chorana. Now, Laura, ever get your kid off for art? What? Yeah, I mean, if you call my only fan's art, then, yeah, a lot of people do. No, honestly, Eunice is a real inspiration. I'm thinking about this and going, do I need to sit for a nude portrait of myself? I think it's like, you know, you know, Laura, you understand me. Like, you always look back at photos from like five years ago and go, man, I was so skinny and hot then and I didn't even know it. Yeah, you've got to capture it now while you're young and hot because, you know, looks le-fayed. Do you want me to paint it? Very much, no, strongly known. Yeah, I'm waiting till the time's right. I'll know. Hey, I do just want to say, if you think you know someone that does have a painting like that or perhaps they went along to a garage sale in Blenham a couple of years ago, please spread the word. We would love to get this picture back to them. It would be a very happy ending to a very cool story. Now also tonight, if your kids haven't started up the holiday fighting, it's probably about to happen. And just in time, we've got a world-renowned Kid Whisperer to help you deal with those battles. And the in time, we've got a world-renowned Kid Whisperer to help you deal with those battles. And the Kardashians have a new show. The project gets the vibe and a chat with Kim, Kylie Courtney and the rest of the crew. Wow. I actually got a kid whisperer at home. It's called the TV. And there is not a child alive who cannot be soothed by its mindless videos. Plop them down right now in front of me because here's the Daily Dose. And we begin with a lesson from a teacher. That lesson is always checked that everyone is ready. So us teachers would never ask you students to do anything we wouldn't do ourselves. What's happening? I didn't know your... Sometimes the best lessons are the ones you didn't plan on teaching. Next up is a wife on seal lookout duty. Very important job. Husband's in there, snorkeling. There's the seal. Okay. And she's not pointing it out yet. Come on. Help them out. She's not pointing it out yet. Finally, there's a seal. He's quite really only pointed out once she realized she wasn't getting any more footage for her when seals attack YouTube channel. And lastly, a hungry toddler who thinks he might have found a source of free food. Oh, yeah, there it is. I don't think you're going to get milk on there. Oh, buddy. Just wants to be self-sufficient. Good on you. And that was your daily doctor. I mean, let's be honest. We've all tried that once or twice. Yeah, yeah. It's another like a little munch on yourself when you've got the munchies. This next story is for you. If it feels like your kids are always fighting, our next guest is head out. When you dreamed of being a parent, it probably looked like this. But often, the reality is a bit more like this. And you're that guy. If your kids spend most of their time together arguing and even physically fighting, you're not alone. So-called sibling rivalry is most likely between kids of the same sex and with an age gap of less than two years. But it can happen in any family. Ow! For parents, it feels nothing like a sick home. It's frustrating and exhausting and can make you feel like you're failing at this whole parenting thing. Dr Becky Kennedy gets it. She's got three kids of her own, plus she's a clinical psychologist who runs a company helping other parents navigate the tough stuff. And she's here now, Dr Becky, to answer some of our questions, probably the main one. How do we stop the kids fighting? So I think a couple things come to mind. Number one is a framework. We have to always ground ourselves in what is my job, what is my role when my kids do fight, and what is my role in teaching my kids the skills they need not to fight rather than focusing on our kids behavior what can we do to prevent fighting number one just talk to your kids about how it's hard to have a sibling just validating that feeling actually decreases fighting because a kid feels normalized inside also spend some one-on-one time with each kid when each kid feels more secure in their role and they're getting attention in the family, they become more able to see a sibling as a playmate and not as a competitor. When they do fight, if there's no physical or verbal aggression, remind yourself my role is to slow down, not solve. Because if we go in and say, fine, you get the red block and then you get the blue block, we're actually making it more likely for our kids to be unable to solve a problem without us intervening. Well, what about just getting some yellow blocks to go with the red and the blue? You know, there's no problem with that. But, you know, what we miss when we come up with a quick solution is it's never about the blocks. Your kids are fighting about the blocks because they're jealous, because they're insecure, because they want and don't know how to want and not have. So we're not really teaching them something by replacing the thing on the surface. We really teach them something by helping them regulate and manage their underlying emotional experience. It's never about the blocks. Good advice. You also have some great advice around replacing words like no and stop, don't you? Can you tell us about them? Here's the thing about no and stop. I wouldn't like my family home with my husband if 90% of the things he said to me were no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop. I would feel controlled. I would feel disempowered. Having said that, the opposite is also awful as well. There sometimes we say no to our kids and actually no can really communicate being clear. And we want to be clear to our kids. That's how they feel safe. They feel like they have a leader who can take care of them. So what I'd say about the no's and the stop is we do want to tell our kids what they can do instead of all the time what they can't do. But by no means do you need to strike the words no and stop from your vocabulary. Got it. Okay, Becky, thank you for joining us. Yes, you can go now. Thanks for having me. I've got three brothers and when we were kids we were known as the Fighting Corbets. So we scrapped. And my dad's solution was to send us to swimming lessons for a couple of hours, and we simply didn't have the energy. He said we sat in the lounge just staring at the wall because we were knackered. Perfect. Okay, so if Dr. Becky's stuff doesn't work for you, just put them in the pool. Is this a Palmer North thing? Because I had two older brothers and we all got sent to swimming as well. But I don't know if that stopped us from fighting. Well, this seems... Just underwater wars. Stop hitting yourself, Laura. It seems a little weird in Parmesan North because I was just up the road in New Plymouth. And my sister and I, funnily enough, were known as the Peaceful Gowers. Oh, will you? Yeah, we never fought. We actually worked a lot on community initiatives. Yeah. Okay, well, if neither of those things resonate for you, maybe Dr. Becky, you want some more words from her. We've got a link to her podcast on our Facebook page. Now, if you haven't finalised those holiday roadie plans, maybe you could take a few detours and check out some of the coolest letterboxes in New Zealand. Which town has the country's coolest letterboxes? We'll get into it next on the project. Enter into your very own universe and get deeper into what you're into.

He's a flash of brilliance. Live and free on three. Unbelievable finish here. NRL Warriors versus Storm. Anzac Day, 830 on 3 and 3 now. Welcome back. Now we are chatting with the Kardashians and we mean all of the Kardashians and they'll tell us why their new show is even better than their last one. That's just up the head. Well, technically she's a Jenner, but that's fine. She still counts. First, are you struggling to come up with the perfect baby name? Turns out that there is a person to help you. Taylor A. Humphrey is a professional baby-nameer. The New Yorker charges clients between $1,000 and $10,000 to help people name their child. No way. The cheaper option involves a simple phone call and questionnaire, while the more expensive option involves genealogical investigation and a name tailored to match a family's business image. She claims to have helped name over 100 babies in the last year alone. Or you could take that money, spend it on a sperm donor to get a better quality kid. Imagine if you spent $10,000 on a baby name and she just came back to you with Jaden. No offense to any of the Jadens out there. Might be the perfect name. I know, well, look, if you're from somewhere like Parmy, then you've already got a bunch of cousins already called Hayden, Hayden, Hayden, Hayden, Braden, Shaden. Yeah, I mean, I'd be worried about the child growing up without the professional baby name and coming to you and saying, hey, why didn't I, you know, was I not worth it? Yeah, was I not worth it? And you've just got to say them, hey, look, straight back to bed, don't say anything. Be true. See, I like, if you Spend that money on a baby name If someone ever criticises it later in life You can say well That was actually named by a professional baby namer So who's got egg on their face now? All right The school holidays are underway And if there's one thing Kiwi's love Is spotting a fun letterbox on a roadie One man indeed loved the chase so much He's put the best ones into a book Twelve years ago Ries Palmer caught the letterbox on a roadie. One man indeed loved the chase so much, he's put the best ones into a book. Twelve years ago, Rhys Palmer caught the letterbox bug. He's been travelling the country taking photos when he sees one that catches his eye like this one that Vaughn's got. We've got a duck letterbox made because we live on Duck Road. It does create a bit of a fad. One guy's got a truck letter box, another person's got a Mickey Mouse letter box. It gives a sense of a bit of fun, a bit of a fad. One guy's got a truck letterbox, another person's got a Mickey Mouse letterbox. It gives a sense of a bit of fun, a bit of character. It's neat to see people stopping and taking selfies, you know, just a bit of fun around the neighbourhood. Now, Rees has turned them into a coffee table book for the people, aptly named Letterboxes of New Zealand, which, of course, you can get delivered to your letterbox. I'm looking forward to seeing not just our letterbox, but lots of other co-ed letterboxes of New Zealand, which of course you can get delivered to your letterbox. I'm looking forward to seeing not just our letterbox, but lots of other core data boxes around the country. Okay, joining us now is letterbox photographer extraordinaire, Reese Palmer. Now, of all the things to take photos of, why letterboxes? Well, it's something that I just started picking up on, you know, over the years and I realised that there was a lot of creativity out there. And they were just worth capturing. Wow, so you've seen so many. So what's the most interesting or weirdest letterbox you've ever seen? Oh, I do have my favourites. There is a lawnmower catcher that I thought. Oh, I do have my favourites. There is a lawnmower catcher that I thought was not that creative but interesting. But a lot of them have been compiled with all sorts of amazing bits and bobs. Did the mowing letter box shred the letters before the owner could recet them? Or it seems a little bit impractical to me? Well, rather impractical, that's what I thought. I suspect they got fairly wet as well. Now cities seem to let us down on this. It's more of a small town and farming community sort of thing, isn't it? Oh, well, there is no, it's hard to say really, but I think there's an unspoken competition that sort of creates itself in these locations. Like there's a rural delivery line-up of boxes at Arthur's Point near Queenstown, and it'd have to be 30 boxes all in a line and a good sort of 12, a dozen of these are all creative. And I think it's a bit of an upmanship at the end of the day. Is there a town or a spot in New Zealand that has the best letterboxes? Oh, I don't think you could go past Waahiki or even Mapua down in the South Island near Nelson. So what you're saying is if there's sort of like nudist type pippies, there'll probably be weird letterboxes there too. I didn't say that. Do you find it hard to just drive through a town in New Zealand without looking? Oh, very much so. I can't drive past either now. I thought once the book was published, I would have got it out of my system, but no, it's not the case. I'm still looking out all the time. Okay, letterbox man, Rhys Palmer, thank you so much for your time. Cheers. You might be getting some mail from Marpua and Wahia, the non-nudis there. And if you at home would like to order a copy of letterboxes of New Zealand, there is a link on our Facebook page, or you can go to at New Zealand letterboxes on Instagram. I feel like as a city dweller, it would be hard to do this. I feel like if I did a novelty letter box, some counsellor would come and shut me down. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, I think you should give it a go and see what happens. See what the neighbours say. You see what the type of person that would send a letter to your neighbours to be like, that's a bit loud, that letter, box? Yeah, well that's why I know it would happen, because I've done that, so... All right, well, it's time to get all the goss with the world's most famous sisters who've now got a new show, much like their old show. The Project Australia's Georgie Tani caught up with the Kardashians. Love them or hate them, it's hard to find a corner of the world where the Kardashians haven't made an impact. I feel like being chased. From how they deal with conflict. Rood. Are you kidding me? To what they consider to be truly important in life. My diamond earring came off in the ocean and it's gone. Kim, there's people that are dying. When keeping up with the Kardashians wrapped after 20 seasons, stacks of weddings, loads of babies and even more giant salads, everyone was devastated, except maybe this guy. I'd rather plant poison ivy plants in my anus before hearing another word about Kim Kardashian. But finally, die-hard fans, me. I think you're better than that. Can wake up happy knowing the long wait for this new show is over. Never go against the family. Never go against the family. The project's Georgie Tunney caught up with the clan. Welcome to the project. Hi. Thank you for having us. Well, Chloe, you really seem to have an affinity for this series. So what was it like getting back into it? I love it. I love filming. I love how much time we spend together. We loved our old production team so, so much. We're just having new people, just with fresh set of eyes and how creative and different it is. It's fun. I was really nervous about having a new production team, but it's not as scary anymore. I'm good with that. The show may have taken a break, but the drama never stopped. Kim's been flaunting her new relationship with Hollywood's street rat Pete Davidson. Well, I think street rat might be a slur, but... This comes after that very public and painful divorce from Kanye West. A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids. So, when I divorced him, you have to know it came down to just one thing. His personality. Well, something different for me and maybe a little bit surprising was to see you a bit flustered, which is how you were in the lead up to your Saturday night live performance, your hosting gig. That was surprising because you guys always seem so polished. How do you get a handle on all those nerves? I just wanted them to hurry up and announce that I was hosting so I couldn't back out. Because once I'm committed, I'm committed. So I was definitely scared until, like, right before I went on. As soon as I got up there, I was totally fine and not nervous. But it was so crazy leading up until that moment. You know what else is crazy? Renaming your child after announcing it to the world. Which is exactly what Kylie did, backtracking on her first pick, Woof. And Kylie, just between you and I, I assure you, it is just you and I. What was his name again? I know, we changed his name, but we haven't officially changed it. So until we officially decide on a name, I just don't want to announce yet another name and then change it again. We didn't have a top three. We didn't even have a top one name when he was born. So the hormones and the pressure to name a child, it just, it's too much. It was too much for me to handle. Hey, ladies, thank you so much for chatting to us. It was so wonderful. Can't wait to see what happens with the rest of the series. Thanks for being on the project. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Oh, my goodness. It is so wonderful to see the girls again. I'll just clear it up for everyone at home. I'm not a Kardashian. I'm not related to them. Oh, I can see. A lot, yeah. But I am a close personal friend. Really? Yeah, Chris Jenner and Courtney Kardashian. No way. When you say close personal friend. I met them once. Did you? In a clothing store in L.A. And I had a brief conversation. The conversation kind of went a little bit like my friend was in the store. She's like, get in here now! The Kardashians are here. And we were in this toy store. And Chris Jenna was looking for her grandchild, Northwest. And she was like, Northwest, Northwest. And we were like, she's just over there. South West. And then she smiled at me. Connection. Yeah, I think it was a smile. Her face didn't move much. All then she smiled at me. Connection. Yeah, I think it was a smile. Her face didn't move much. So she will be missing you very, very much. I know, it's been so unfortunate because of the pandemic. I haven't been able to go back over there and hang out with the team or cows. You know what? You know what's real name is, don't you? What? I don't know. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry, no, I'll do that on my phone. Were there cameras? I feel like that family doesn't do anything without cameras. No, there weren't cameras, but there was paparazzi. Oh, of course, yes. And also, Jeremy, they famously just took a whole four months off filming their TV show, okay? So they definitely have breaks. They definitely have breaks from the cameras. The new series, The Kardashians, it's streaming every Thursday on Disney Plus episode two. Out this Thursday, I cannot wait, love them. There's more to come on the project. Another summer. 80s series business. On Aussie's busiest beach. The rip just keep pushing you back.
