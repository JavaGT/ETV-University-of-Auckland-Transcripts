It's good enough for me, and lots of others, and ought to be good enough for you. England's an old country. There are no chances for young fellows like me. I want to go to a new country and work in the sand. Somewhere is not old and foggy like this. You want to go to one of these year wild places like New Zealand, not so fresh air and lots of hard work. I wouldn't mind that. I wouldn't mind going to New Zealand. Mr. Wakefield, your New Zealand company may be a very good theme. But as you know, our experiences with colonies have not all been happy one. New Zealand is an ideal country. Possibly. But Her Majesty will not annex these islands without the natives voluntarily acknowledging her sovereignty. Very high-minded, I'm sure. I can understand your annoyance. You have high hopes of your colonization company. My annoyance will be better understood in a hundred years' time when New Zealand is one of England's most cherished colonies. I hope that time will prove your words correct, Mr. Wakefield. In the meantime, you should shortly know if New Zealand is to be one of England's colonies. Captain Hobson, who will endeavour to persuade the natives of New Zealand, to seize sovereignty to our Queen, should be there by now. I think I'm going to go. I trust that I have made it plain that the government of Her Majesty, the Queen, shall alone have the right and the power to buy land from now the owners. These owners shall sell only when they wish and without compulsion. Furthermore, this treaty shall in no way restrict religious liberty. And now you, the Maori people of New Zealand, must decide whether or not you wish to become subjects of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and to share the rights of her other subjects both here and across the seas. Shall I translate your excellency? Thank you, Mr. Williams. He is the government, and the queen, and now, there's the mother to the hoskow. He said the Mauda, he says, they've got to you, they've got to you, hehoku, eh-hook. He says the Maori people will not listen to you. Go back. Have they ever listened to Basby? So will they listen to you as stranger? I'm not to this take. We're not, no, no, to you. This is right, this is this thing? Why is it? What do you know why stay? Moki says, why is stay? Will you make dealing straight? Hey, what we're this government? We're not our Pacheh. Ray were saying, what do we want for the governor? We're not whites or foreigners? You know, the government? You're, comea. We're not whites or foreigners. He said, I know it the Kavan. It's what we're, no, I'm a man. No, he's a koreh. Atira, all, he says, you too stay here, you in Besby, you were. I'm not, I'm a better, I'm going to get a lot. I, I don't know that. This Iwi MƒÅori, hukkara, hukkah this is the caller, if you are you to this government, if you're not going to if there are, that's what are you going to? How are these? He said we're going to do. Optopheon of our own to our own our nation. We have a government to return. He said He said I wish to speak to ourselves the natives. What do you say? The governor to return but is not our land already gone? As grass covers it? Is it not already covered with men over whom we have no power? You say that the governor is to go back. Had you spoken thus in the olden times when the traders and grog sellers came? Had you turned them away, then you could well say to the governor, go back. And I would have said it with you. But now, no. They are here, so let us all be friends together. Let us keep the governor here. He must preserve our customs and never permit our lands to be taken from us. He must be our friend and our governor. Come, let us sign the treaty. The home. I have been a day of it. I'm here. I'm here. I'm not. The home point. I'm going to go. I go. Believe me if all those those endearing young charms, Which I gaze on so fondly today, Were to change by tomorrow or fleet in my lungs, like fairy gifts fading away. Thou would still be adored, as this moment thou art, Let thy loveliness fade as it will. And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart would entwine itself bad Badantly still.

And again we thank thee, God, for bringing us safely across the mighty deep, to this our desired haven. Amen. We shall now read the 23rd Psalm. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restored my soul. He leaded me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

Felling the trees and burning them, the basis of most of New Zealand's early grasslands. Seed was sown on the bare cold embers, and the grass grew. But often in later years, Fern and scrub grew too. I'm gonna' I'm gonna'n't I'm gonna'a. I'm gonnae. And so with the years of toil, grow up the signs of their labors. The forest had bowed to the axe. And so were the years of toil, grow up the signs of their labors. The forest had bowed to the axe, and the earth had opened up to the plough, and the virgin land was becoming cultivated and was bearing. As their child grew, so did there are few rough possessions, from the forest and the land, and by the constant drive of the labour of the seasons. They built up and strove for the security and prosperity that men think they find in taming the soil. But had they been able to tame the elements, there were still the storms in men's hearts and the icy coldness of the wind that gathers the clouds of war was beginning to be felt in the land. I'm Well, we seem to be getting on our feet a bit now, Mary. At last we've got some sheep on the place. It's been hard work for you, Tom. And for you too, you seem to be always working, my dear. It's worth it. Oh yes, it is. And yet I wonder if we'd have come here, if we'd have known how hard it was going to be. And now it's beginning to look as though we're going to have some real trouble with the MƒÅori's. Why, what's been happening? Jack Rogers has lost some of these Maori boys. They've gone back to the bush. That looks bad to me. No good ever came a frighten. Before the white man came, you fought one with the other. They were burning, killing, weeping, but no good ever came on it. I'm a lot of the other, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm and I'm, and I'm, the other one, I'm going to get a khani, kha, Kierke, khan, kya, khan, khan, khan, that's what, that's, here, there. I'm gonna'a. I'm Oh, my Godo! Oh, my Godo! Oh, man, go to puttah! He'll do you and another, cuttah! Yeah! Oh, Jesus has a little bit of a puttah! Eil an encha-pura! It looks like a storm blowing up, Tom. It looks like a storm blowing up, Tom. Yes, it certainly does, Mary. Don't like it a bit. That mail rider is late too. Yes, he is late, isn't he? There he is, Dad. Coming round the panetry. That's not the mail rider. Looks like Jack Rogers. It is Jack Rogers. Travelling fast, there's something wrong. What is it, Mr. Rogers? Look out, the Maury's are coming. Get your horses and get to town. The Maoris! The Maoris! Quickly, get the child here. Tom. Whoa, whoa there, whoa. Take the baby, Tom. Yes, right, dear. To climb on your Tom. Yes, right dear. You're climbing your horse. All right, you're right. Hold on, fella. You're right. Don't, let's get him. Come on. Let's get away. I don't know. Oh! Oh! Oh! How are you coming? How are you coming? How are you around? Go on. Get the women and children from love health. Come. Come. Go away. How many else from We're talking out. The The I'm here. I'm here. Gold! Gold. Gold, filling men's veins with a fever of riches. The news acting like magic and spreading through the land like fire. Diggers from Bendigo, diggers from Ballarat, seekers from Yukon on the Barbary coast, laundress from Canton, soldiers from England, mysterious rumor, wild tales in the post. Horses, wagons, bullet teams, all conceivable forms of transport were thrown into the service of the seekers. A find at Black Peters, a find at the Lindis, 3,000 ounces from the rising sun, gold from the keep it dark, gold from the rise and shine, the arrow, the buller, cradles and pans and a hundred pubs. On rough stream beds, diggers in thousands sought the riches that hardship would reward. Storekeepers, tradesmen, sharpers and soldiers, flour going well, 150 the tonne, a warden and gold law, dancers and danceholes. A town sprung up where before there was none. Thank you. I'm I'm gonnae'n't I'm I'm I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm gonnae. I'm The The I'm gonna'a. As the land was opened up, a new trouble descended upon the colony, that of overproduction. By 1880, New Zealand had discovered that although she could produce enormous quantities of meat, it could not be marketed. The yards were full of stock that was practically unsaleable. And yet there was a shortage of meat in England. New Zealand was facing ruin, while the London markets were hungry for her produce. The problem was, how to get it there? Refrigeration proved to get it there. Refriguration proved to be the solution. It created an overseas market for New Zealand that decided her destiny. She came to be a producer of meat and butter and cheese for the world's market. Refiduration was perhaps the most important event in the first hundred years of New Zealand history. The prosperity that the newly open markets provided led to an enormous increase in production and settlement and paved the way for really progressive administration. New Zealand began a course of social legislation that amazed the world. The Land for Settlement Act divided up big holdings and established many small farmers on their own land. The Electoral Act of 1893 gave every citizen the right to vote. New Zealand women never had to be suffragettes. The arbitration court was established to ensure a fair deal for the employer and for the men. The introduction of the old age pension freed the small wage earner from the fear of destitution in declining years. And thus New Zealand grew up. The increasing overseas markets expanded her production and the characteristics of her rural life was shaped. New Zealand's external purchases depend almost entirely on what comes from the land. Her social schemes, which are a feature of her national characteristic, depend largely on the same source. New Zealand has developed secondary industries and is self-dependent in many aspects. But the produce from the land is the mainstay of her existence, her overseas purchasing power. To take care of the land is to take care of the future. New Zealand exists in the soil. Today, taking care of the land has become a matter of national concern. Soil erosion has become a problem in some parts of New Zealand. In the early haste to clear more land for farming, fire was run through the forests of the plains and the valleys and was allowed to sweep bare the hill ranges also. Now nature is striking back at us for our past wastefulness. She is comparing us to rear forest and to find other means of preventing denuded hillsides from slipping down and ruining fertile valleys. Nature never accepts excuses for mistakes. But we would have been more than human to have made no mistakes during the stupendous task of rushing forward a country from savagery to civilization in 100 crowded years. We have built and equipped modern cities, where before there was nothing save perhaps a few huts of leaves and rushes. With large and fast ships, we have spanned the oceans which separate us from our neighbors, and we have provided the best of port equipment for our commerce. We have spread a trackless land with a network of roads, and over them we operate the transport of a nation. We have bonded the country with rails of steel for our steam and electric trains, and we build the trains which ply-like shuttles from end to end of our land. We have bridged the rivers and gorges which blocked our path. We have harnessed the rivers to provide light and heat and power for our transport, our cities and our industries. With airports and aircraft, we have brought 20th century speed to a Stone Age land, telescoping centuries done in our first hundred years, building on the foundations laid for us by the sweat and the toil of our pioneers. All these material things we have formed. But what of the human side? What have we done for our people? We have done much. New Zealand has always paid high regard to the welfare of the people, their health, their homes, their education, their occupations and their freedom. Let us look at random at a few of the monuments which testify to this national concern for human well-being. Public health. A state department always watching over the things affecting the health of the people and ensuring that they have hygienic living conditions. At the state school, the children's health is watched over while they are receiving their education. Pure milk is issued to the children every day. And staffs of doctors and nurses give regular medical and dental care. All such work must first receive the consent of parents and it is done with the cooperation of education authorities. It is free of charge as is education itself. With ability and inclination, primary school pupils can win further free education at colleges and at universities. But with all the skill and care bestowed, people still fall sick and when illness overtakes the family breadwinner, family finances are apt to be badly strained. So we have our National Social Security scheme, giving free general and maternity hospital care and universal old age payments. Now run back down the scale from old age to infancy. Here New Zealand leaves the world. The late Sir Truby King pioneered and developed a New Zealand system of infant welfare which has now become a worldwide movement. New Zealand today has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world and all over the world are these living memorials to the life work of a great man. All these things revolve about the home, the New Zealanders chief concern. Of course, home means more than just a house, but a house is one of the main parts of a home. The State Housing Department is carrying out a big national plan, building houses which are not workers' dwellings, but homes for people who work. The problem is how to build enough to meet the demand. Another of New Zealand's problems has special reference to our Maori people. How best they can adapt themselves to the changed ways of life brought by the Europeans. It is a problem which both our races are uniting to solve by mutual effort, by goodwill and by cooperation. The impact of Western civilization a hundred years ago caused the drastic and imperative adjustment in the economic life of the Maori people and in consequence a transitional period had to be endured. My forebears discarded some of their tribal customs. In this period differences and disputes arose. Happily, those days are past, and our two races now live together in harmony. Indeed, the Maori Battalion of Volunteers is now in England side by side with the PƒÅkehƒÅ, New Zealand soldiers, as in the Great War, to defend the land and the rights we share. However, in some matters we must retain our individuality, our carving and weaving, our music and dancing. These are an expression of something deep within us. I'm a hushed-and-a-kuh-warn, I'm a man, now. I, and I'm a pegoid, and you are, a day, and I'm here, ha, ha, ha, ha, and a child, oh, I'm here, a greek you, a way, so man, now, a, I'm a beautiful, Ahea, Kroarro, Aene, Kroar, Ahii Awe, we're, our hau' da'clock My M'athe T'Oryok Yes. I'm a little bit of Tzu-Rey-Torra-T-I-Koh-H-P-P-P-P-P-Nay-T-N-A-T-N-K-Leghhh-T-N-Kro emas. E-P-P-P-P-Legh, make-tuc-Li-Mas. But that I'ma'a'a'a'a'n'a'a'n'a'a'n'a'h'n'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'h'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' But music and dancing for this modern world. But music and dancing and art are not enough for this modern world. We need also such things as our native land development scheme and the adaptation of modern farming to the community instincts of the Maori. There is a reawakening among the Maori people and the realization of the need to meet the PƒÅkeha at his own game. I should like you to know of our native schools and colleges, for education is the beginning of understanding with both Maori and Pakeha, an understanding that must weld our future. But what is to be our future? Sadly, our first century closes with conflict ravaging the world. Conflict on a vast scale. Conflicts which we rise to face in 1940 were the same spirit in which we faced it in 1914. To secure the future, we must first look to the present, taking courage from the past. Will we of this generation lay us good a foundation for New Zealand, us look to the pleasant, taking courage from the past. Will we of this generation lay as good a foundation for New Zealand's second century as our pioneers did for the first? They knew hard necessity and harsh abandonment of kinsfolk who were dear. They knew fears, and with hope they laid aside their fears and struggled on through a thousand trials and besititudes. Their very purpose breathed a challenge which we, in the knowledge of their deeds, carry on into a new century, to face a new and striving future with the undaunted spirit that was theirs, to leave to our children that precept which are pioneers have left to us. May God grant that we shall not fail them."}
