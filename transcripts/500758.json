Rathomaniae, or can signate or not the fact that for the offer? about nurses not having a voice, absolutely, that's how they felt disenchanted with the health system. What we've done as a union is needed to collect that power and say to members, we have the opportunity to ensure that we have a voice moving forward, a collective voice. So, as I said, this is critical for how we bring together the nurses that work within the district health boards, but also how we collectively kept power so that nurses outside of the THB also have the privilege of being recognised in this way. We've seen through the current PE offer increase in base rates. So that's critically important as we try to attract people into nursing, that we recognise them and pay them accordingly. The back pay issue is a sticky part. Moving forward, we've got to make sure that we do that right, that we inform our members of our legal advice, and that our members can make a decision whether or not they want to go effectively, immediately to the Employment Relations Authority or to take the other option and look at settling.

Thousands of children are dying right now. Children like Dahir haven't eaten for days and are close to death. Without food or medical care, many children like Abdi won't survive. The severe drought that's hitting this part of Africa can no longer be ignored. If we don't act now, thousands more children will die. At Save the Children, we are doing all we can, but we urgently need your help to do more. We need to provide these children with emergency food, medical care and fresh, clean water. Please call Save the Children on 0800-6666-694 or go online at Save the Children.org. and give just $5 a month. If we don't act now, the situation will only get worse and more children will die.
