Kjura, Koursa Ho, and this is Brainbusters. Who has the mind power to make it all the way through the rounds and end up at this? The Brain Buster. Chura, call Tyler Naita Wong a ho. The Brain Buster is no joke. Will our players be up for the challenge? Let the fun begin. Kure to Tyler, and don't forget, you can play from home as well. So let's meet today's BrainBusters. Hello, my, hi-to-my, welcome to Brain Busters. Today we have four players hoping they've got what it takes to be called the ultimate brain buster. We'll start with Mega Memory before we make our way into our specialist subject rounds where our players can choose from six of our options. Zal hope to gain enough points to stay in this game and avoid elimination. So let's meet our players now. And first up, we have Maya. Now, Maya, what's your favourite Justin Bieber song? Baby. Can't beat the classics, right? See if some Justin Bieber knowledge is going to pop up on the show today. We'll have to wait and see. Eli, welcome to the show. Keen on a bit of mountain biking. Who do you go mountain biking with Elo? Most of my dad, but sometimes with my friends. So who's faster between you and your dad? Depends what track, yeah. I think that's a safe answer to say, Eli. Well said. We also have Abby who's played some rugby in the past. What position do you play? I played for them win. Very different positions. Let's do the hard work up front but also scoring those tries down the sideline. Can you score the big try, which is a brain busters victory today? Hopefully. That's the confidence we like. And we also have Ryan a keen cricket player. What kind of bowling do we do? Spinning. Offspin? League spin? League. Nice. Well, thank you so much. Do we everyone for coming being a part of the show. We'll jump into it and take on the first round of the day. It is time to play Mega Memory. 90 seconds on the clock for Mega Memory, so a whole lot of time to score a whole lot of points. Let's get to it. Good luck. Your time starts now. What liquid would you normally do a dive bomb or Manu into? Eli. Water. What type of animal are said to pull Santa Slay? Maya. Rain Deer. Do the shoes called crocs usually have laces? Abby. No. What colour is the home uniform of the all blacks? Eli. Black. What is seven times seven? Abby. Forty nine. Worn on the face. Spectacles is another word for what? Eli. Glasses. How many hemispheres make up a sphere? Eli. None. Two. Is the singer Shakira originally from Cambodia or Colombia? Abby. Cambodia. Cambodia. Is a wind sock worn on the foot? Eli. No. What is the largest super volcano in New Zealand? Eli. Taranaki. Koppor. In 2019, Little Nazeks released the hit song Old Town What. Ryan. Ryan. Right. What colour is the red capsicum? Ryan. Red. Makes sense. What name of footwear is a shortening of Japanese sandals? Eli. Drandals. Is New Zealand a monarchy, a democracy or both? Abby. Democracy? It's both. Is a hearing, a fish or a fashion accessory? Ryan. A fish. What colour are rubies usually associated with? Eli. Red. Which bat and bullsport shares its name with a chirping insect? Eli. Fricket. What type of transport is raced in the Bathurst 1000? Abby. Race car? Is the right answer and does finish off. Mega memory. Well done everyone. Thank you all for playing. Let's have a look at the scores. Eli has 50 points. Ryan has 30 points. Maya is on 10 points and Abby also has 10 points. So now we move into our specialist subject rounds and seeing that Maya and Abby both share the same score will simply go from left to right, meaning Maya. You get to go first, so what would you like to play? Blue printer. Thank you very much, Maya. Let's play Blueprintter. Maya, please step forward. Let's get into it. 30 seconds to have a look at what your blueprints is and then 30 seconds to put your answers in. Maya, good luck. Here comes your blueprints. Machu Picchu Landmarks. Your time starts now. The lost city of the Inca Empire is best known to the world as Machu Picchu, which translates to Old Mountain. On this old mountain, you will find many impressive sites, including Intihua Tana, a large shrine Inca astronomers used to predict solstices. 10 seconds left. It's time, 30 seconds on the clock to put your answers in, which starts now. 10 seconds left. 10 seconds left. All answers, locked. All answers, locked in. All right, Mike, let's take a look and see how you've got on. First up. Cemetery, unfortunately, not in the right place. The hotel is, though. The main temple does not belong there, I'm afraid, Meyer. But the sacred rock is in the right spot. But we couldn't finish it off with the Sun Temple, unfortunately. Still some points on the ball, which is what it's all about. Maya, thank you very much. I'm sure the Beaves would be proud of you. Maya now joins Eli in first place with 50 points. And it is time for our second player to come forward and take on their specialist subject round. That player is Abby. So Abby, what are you playing? Spellbinder. Thank you very much, what are you playing? Spell Binder. Thank you very much, Abby. Let's play Spell Binder. Abby, please step forward. Abby, I wish you the very best of luck. Thank you. Here comes, your first word. Fable. Fable. If comes your first word. Fable. F-A-B-L-E. Correct. Envision. Envision. Envision. Envision. Envision. F-N-V-I-S-I-O-N. F-E-L-E-L-E-N. Your next word is, sanctity. Sanctity. S-A-N-C-T-A-T-Y. Very close. T-I-T-Y. And your final word is cavity. Cavity, C-A-V-I-T-Y. That is absolutely correct for another 20 points to finish off your specialist subject round. Well done, Abby. Thank you very much for taking on Spellbinder. Abby jumps into the lead with 70 points. And just like that, we are halfway through our specialist subject rounds. F. Ike Ney, Ryan and Eli, will take on their subjects, but of course all of our players are hoping they can head to the Brain Buster. One wrong move on the Brain Buster, and it could be an early finish for one of our players. Let's hope they're up for it. I think they are, Tyler. Thank you very much for that. And don't forget, you can play from home as well. Don't go anywhere. We'll see you. I'm Muriodyyukata. You have an amazing show for you. Keep at fresh. Go ahead. Keep a fresh. Fresh Saturday, 10 a.m. on 2. Throw it, Kate. Come on. It's getting chilly out here. Look at them. Sitting there like they own the place. Come on. Throw it. One swift movement in you're in. With Pinesh, might I add. Yeah, that's it. Kate Marshall? The AA now has an emergency service for your home that works much like AA Road Service. A.A. Home Response Plus. Subscribe now. With the last grand final spots up for grabs. Oh, panic. Nobody wants to be the last to fall. I'm feeling like that's it. We're going home. We're going to miss out on the final. All new Lego Masters, New Zealand. Tonight, feeling like that's it. We're going home. We're going to miss out on the final. All new Lego Masters, New Zealand, tonight. 7.30 on 2. Good on, no. Welcome back to Brainbusters. Just before the break, we had Maya and Abby take on their specialist subject rounds, and coming up to the front now will be Ryan. So, Ryan, what are you playing? Equaliser. Thank you very much. Let's play. Equalizer. Ryan, what are you playing? Equalizer. Thank you very much. Let's play. Equalizer. Ryan, please step forward. All right, Ryan, time to get into Equalizer. Of course, 20 points for each equation you get correct. Ryan, I wish you the best of luck. Let's get to it now. Good luck. 33, multiplied by four, equals... 132. It's correct. One quarter of 50 plus 10 equals. 22.5. One quarter of 248. Divided by four. Subtract 23 equals. Negative 15. Negative 7.5. And finally for Equalizer. 12, multiplied by 5. Subtract 27 equals. 83. 33 was the answer to our final one there for Equaliser. Right, I think you're a little bit unlucky here. Definitely should have got one, maybe even two more right, but still points on the board. It's what it's all about here on Brainbusters. So thank you very much for taking on Equalizer. Ryan joins Abby in first place with 70 points. And we have one player remaining to take on their specialist subject round. That player is Eli. So Eli, what are you playing? Identifier. Thank you very much. Let's play Identifier. Eli, please step forward. Let's do it. Eli, best step forward. Let's do it. Eli, best of luck. Time to play, identify. Green Anaconda, can cobra rattlesnake? Arrange these snakes from smallest to largest. Great start, Eli. Identify the three examples of melting. There's another 20 points. Select the three renewable ways in which electricity is generated in New Zealand. or smearth at Eli. Please eliminate three imperial measurements. Correct again. And finally, galaxy, planets, solar system, from smallest to largest, arrange these spatial units by size. This for a perfect score. Do you think you've got it, Eli? Hopefully. Let's find out. That's one. That's two, and that is three, meaning Eli, you have a perfect score and a great way to finish things off here for our specialist subject round. Thank you very much for taking on Identifier. Thank you. After that perfect score, Eli is now back in first place with 150 points. Abby has 70 points, Ryan also has 70 points points and then we have Maya on 50 points. So unfortunately we need to eliminate our first player today on Brain Busters and I'm sorry to say that Maya it is you but you do go home with a $50 bank account. So what are you going to do with the money? Probably spends it on something to do with Justin Bieber. As you should, Maya, great choice and hey thank you very much for coming and being a part of Brainbusters today. And also a big congratulations to our three remaining players for them. It's one step closer to the Brainbuster. Our remaining players have got to stay switched on. Amygdala is the goal. But to get there, they've got to conquer this. The Brain Buster. Thank you for that, Tyler. And before we can head to the Brain Buster, we have the Brain Teaser.
