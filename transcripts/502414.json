Yeah, hey Sam. Apparently, hundreds of these nurses want to come back to work, but they're not currently allowed. So today the project asks Kiwis whether it's time for that mandate to end. Overwhelmed hospitals, delayed surgeries, burnt out medical staff. New Zealand is suffering a healthcare crisis. Well, the government doesn't like that word, preferring to label it a chronic staffing shortage. Whatever you call it, we're in trouble made worse by a shortage of 4,000 nurses. A group claims they've got 700 nurses and healthcare workers ready to help. The catch? All those belonging to nurses for Freedom New Zealand at some point have said no to the jab. But the Nurses Society say unvaccinated nurses are not wanted back. Our position's pretty clear. They're a small minority, minuscule minority. They've displayed poor judgment. They've not met their professional obligations and the health service doesn't want them back. But during crisis, sorry Minister Little, is it better to have an unvaccinated nurse rather than no nurse at all? It's absolutely not good to have them back. They expose patients and their colleagues to risk and they've displayed bad judgment. Nursing practice is to be based on evidence. They haven't followed evidence. That's their position. But what do New Zealanders think? We commissioned survey company Yabel to poll Kiwis around the country asking, should unvaccinated nurses be allowed back to work? The nose were 43% those who said yes, 57%. Joining us now, Nurses for Freedom Representative Deborah Cunliff. Deborah, what are you calling for here? Nurses for Freedom and say you enter the mandates and all healthcare practitioners return to work to support a healthcare system that's clearly in crisis. We hired a polling company today an impartial polling company. We asked should unvaccinated nurses be allowed back to work? 57% of New Zealanders said yes and 43% said no. What do you make of those numbers? Hi, Jessie. Kiwis are a really sensible bunch, so we're not surprised at all. And it backs up what we're hearing from the public. Mount 80s nurses have a lot of support behind them, and healthcare clearly matters to the people of New Zealand. Our nurses want to help. If the nurses did go back, would you be happy for patients to choose to be treated by only vaccinated nurses if they so desired? Hi, Jeremy. Absolutely. Personal choice is the key here, and it has been all along. What we would like to do is employ risk mitigation strategies such as rat testing or PPE so that we can assure the New Zealand public we're not going to pass on COVID any more than a vaccinated nurse. Well, David Wells at the Nurses Society also says that number that you're using 700 nurses is an overestimation. What is that number really? How many registered nurses do you represent that could actually go back to work tomorrow? Remember, this isn't just about nurses. It's about the 200 midwives that have been mandated. It's about the 500 allied health professionals and numerous doctors, dentist, consultants. In our case, we ran a snapshot poll of our nurses, and 75% of that 730 are registered nurses, and the majority of those are ready to go back to work. And of course, nurses for freedom is part of voices for freedom. And that group, I mean, lots of Kiwis don't agree with that group, both your actions and beliefs. And we're not here to debate that. But why do you think Kiwis should trust this call you're making or even trust your members as healthcare workers? Actually, Voices for Freedom and Nurses for Freedom are two completely separate entities and not in any way connected. I am a Voices for Freedom coordinator and I've made that very clear all along. But we are, and there's a connection between the two groups, because like NZVOS, Voices for Freedom, clearly support our cause. But although the name sounds very similar, we're not, we are two separate entities. Well, our main objective is to get our nurses back to work to support the health system that's in crisis. And we want to be free to do that, and we want the mandate dropped. Deborah Kahnloff, thanks for your time tonight. Thank you. Thanks. Welcome along to the project, everybody. Look, Mark Richardson is here tonight. If you're a regular project viewer, you will know that we are very pro-vaccination, pro-booster. I think we were pretty surprised to see that result today. 57% of New Zealanders, according to this poll, keen for those unvaccinated nurses to come back. We need the staff, but I, for one, I wouldn't want a family member being treated by an unvaccinated nurse. I'm the same. I'm sorry. I just want to know that my healthcare workers are vaccinated and that they're all in the same camp. Just for God's sake, get the jab, go back to work. Take one for the team. Every now and then we have to do something we don't want to do. But your country's calling. Get the jab and go back. I don't care what your rationale is behind. Your country's saying we need you. So go and do something. It was like me fielding under the helmet. I didn't want to do it, but I did it for the good of the country. Right. Thanks, Mark. Did it work? Did you win? Never caught one. Well, also tonight, Uncle Ticks is a TikToker with over 4 million followers who's here tonight to tell us about the petition he's bringing to Parliament. And we meet the popular online chef who's shaking up classic Kiwi cuisine for today's fussy families. Right, it's the 13th, which means that for those doing dry July, only 19 days to go. For those not doing dry July, time to open your 13th bottle of wine for the month. Chin Chin to the daily dose. All right, we'll begin with the video of a dog following its human into the house. Let's go. The only problem is there's the human going through the door. The dog is an idiot. He's now knocking on heaven's door. He's fine, he's fine. I hope. House, on the other hand, could look at those foundations. Next, Snapchat filters these days. They're very incredible. Just ask this old guy who can't believe he's not actually wearing sunglasses. I haven't got sunglasses. What are you doing? I don't have sunglasses. They actually also got the old person filter on. He's 24, that guy. Finally, nothing settles an argument between full-grown men better than a foot race. Unfortunately, some people just aren't suited to running, like this guy. Two, three. Didn't make it very far. It's all right, though. It's all right, all right. We'll go back. We'll start again. It will be on YouTube tomorrow, and the daily dose of the day after that. Here we go. He's off. Oh, he's got a bit of speed too. Only problem, he's got the old four of us again. Yeah, all makes sense once you hear that guy as a professional soccer player. That was your daily dose. The old, you can't beat me because I fell over technique. I've used that a bit. Well, for those living with Tourette's life can be great. It can also be tough. But for many, there are those, for many, there isn't any help on those days that are tough. Why is that? Tourette's syndrome involves repetitive movements and uncontrollable ticks. Action. One in 100 people in Altaire live with Tourette's, and boys are four times more likely to have it. It can be tough on both them and their families. It's not uncommon for people to have ticks where they injure themselves, whether it's through kicking, hitting, punching, some get a compulsion to stab themselves with if they're holding scissors or fork. Despite this, Tourette's isn't classified as a disability by the Ministry of Health. That means there's no funding for support services. We receive no help. You know, our kids don't qualify for teacher aids in the classroom because they don't technically have a disability. They can often fall behind in their reading and writing and a teacher aid would be really handy just to point them back in the direction where they were going. And for adults, Tourette's syndrome can be as difficult as it is unpredictable. You can go through really good periods where, you know, you can achieve things. You can make yourself breakfast. You can clean your house. You can do your washing and hang it out. And then you'll go through periods of time where you just can't achieve any of that by yourself. You actually need help and support. Kiyoda. My name is Layton. I have Tourette's. Layton Clark, aka Uncle Tix, educates his TikTok followers, more than 4 million of them, about Tourette's. His petition to recognise it as a disability in New Zealand has attracted nearly 4,000 signatures. He hopes that'll be enough to make the government pay attention. Well, a little earlier on this evening, we talked to Laiton, and I started by asking what Tourette's means to him. Yeah, well, it's become my entire life. It's become my persona. Well, I made it my personality and who I am. I thought, one day I woke up and I was like, fuck this place sucks, fuck the project. Sorry, don't be offended by that, couldn't help that one. I woke up one day and I was like, you know what? Why do I lie around at home? Being real dull, might as well go out there and enjoy my life. And yeah, I just did that one day and now I feel happy as. Why have you decided to get this petition going right now? I'm just sick of no support for those kids out there that are in school. I see you messaging me every day saying, we need support. I don't even have teacher aides. There we go. There's no support. There we go. There's no support for kids with Tourette's or ADHD out there. No teacher aids. But yeah, that was why I started it. It would be good to see kids supported out there in the Motu here. The Ministry House say that there may be support for you as a neurological disorder. Have you received anything from them? No, my Fana went private. We went private when I was really young. And if it wasn't for my grandparents helping me through all of that when I was really young I probably wouldn't be the person I am today so yeah. Do you think one of the issues is that Tourette's maybe isn't taken seriously because people kind of joke about it when they hear that word Tourette's? Ah, yeah, well listen to me man, I'm a bloody walking joke but of the day, well, that's my job to make people laugh and smile. But at the end of the day, it is a serious illness. And it's something that probably should be taking more seriously, yeah. If you didn't, if we were doing social media, do you think having a regular 9-5 job would be difficult for you? I think it would be, yep. I probably would have given up on the old retail by now. But I made it work with my life. I toured DJs for 10 years, and I'd probably be continuing to do that now. It's been an incredible story of the following you've built up on social media. How's that experience been for you? Amazing. My fans are really cool. They are day one supporters, and without them, again, I probably wouldn't be here and wouldn't be who I am to this day, so yeah. And you've made a difference, right? You've helped understanding within New Zealand, probably globally, about what Tourette's is and what life's like. I appreciate that. That's amazing! Yeah, you can beep that. Well, Uncle Ticks, Leighton, thanks so much for your time tonight. Kiyo Tau Finan, thanks having us. From what I saw when Layton was in here, it's an outrage that they don't say that this is a disability. There is no way that society is set up for someone with that affliction at that level to be able to operate normally, and there's no way that someone like that, they are disabled from enjoying society as we can enjoy it because it's such a difficult thing to handle on both parts. It's a disability, it's a no-brainer. And I should say we edited it out a few parts of that interview that were pretty full-on. It's almost like Leiden sometimes says the worst thing that his brain can possibly come up with. You were really copying it by the way. Yeah, I was just good though, we bonded. But I put him up to that. He said everything I've been wanting to say to Jeremy for a long time now. If you'd like to support Leighton's petition, we've got a link up on our Facebook page. Coming up, Jeremy has been absolutely fizzing about these new pictures from the Space Telescope. He's going to show us why we should be wowed by them too. It's next on the project.

I can imagine my daughter making that this weekend. Love it. Yeah, but first, how far would you go to take a selfie? An American tourist has made headlines after falling into a crater on Mount Vesuvius while taking a selfie. 23-year-old man was hiking when he entered a forbidden area to get a better shot of the Italian volcano. Near the edge, he dropped his phone and while trying to get it back, slid some way into the crater. Local guide saved him from nearly a 300 metre fall. Yeah, this is definitely the worst thing that's ever happened at Mount Vesuvius, isn't it? It's a little bit hard to feel sorry for this guy, isn't it? Yeah, it's a story that always starts with an American tourist. You know, she's going to... An American tourist turned up, respected all the customs and signage and had a good time. You better hope the rescuer wasn't into selfies. Just take a selfie instead of rescuing. Well, I hope they got a photo of him before they rescued him. Mark, you ever take him a selfie? No. What? Never in your life? No, I'm trying to think, no. You've never been to a landmark and wanted to So I'm gonna actually put my Brilliant mind to work Yeah And I'm going to take one now First ever selfie Wow that could be quite valuable But you know what this is? What? This is the first and only selfie I'll ever take Yeah This is what you call an NFT You want to get us all in? A non-fungible token What do I look at? The camera. You look at the camera. There you go. Done. I just got Laura and it makes them more valuable. If you want to buy my NFT and make lots of money? Well, no, you're not going to make it. We're going to note the money to the Tourette's Association of New Zealand. One and only selfie ever taken of myself, the last one ever. Get on. How do they... Go to our Facebook page. That'll be a terrible photo, I can guarantee that. But there are some good photos here. I'm loving the cosmic photos you may have seen released by NASA today. They're from the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is floating around 1.6 million kilometres from Earth. It's giving us the best images of the universe we've ever seen. Well, what do you get for your money? Well, on the left, well, that's a great one, the Cosmic Cliffs. That's one of my favorites, but I've got a comparison for you. Check out this photo. That's the old Stink Hubble telescope. Next to it is the new one taken by the James Webb Telescope, or JWT, as I like to call it now. And the, yeah, the resolution is just amazing. But if you don't feel gobsmacked by those, check this out. See that spot this arrow is pointing to on the screen? There it is. Okay, let me just zoom in, courtesy of the James Webb Telescope. That's what was in that tiny little dot. All that stuff we can't see with our eyes on that spot. The very bright bits of stars near us. The other stuff, they're all galaxies, all Milky Way's floating around out there, money well spent. Very amazing. It's amazing. Just enjoy them. You don't have to be a nerd. It's a big place, the universe. I move over Edmund's cookbook. Put your feet up. Alison Holst is a new cook in the Kiwi kitchen. And she's here to stir things up at meal time.

I want to know why a book, you can hold a book up. Why a book when you're crushing it online? Do you need it? Well, a lot of my followers have been begging me for a cookbook for a while. Sure enough. And I just sort of be an extension of what I'm already doing online. And yeah, it's nice to have something tangible in my hands. Pretty exciting. How do you describe your style of cooking? Just easy, everyday, delicious meals for families, and quite affordable and achievable for people. And you have broken the internet a couple of times. It's sort of been some of a bit more popular recipes. Yeah, probably like the chocolate wheat-bick slice, which is a nice classic recipe. People love desserts. They love the caramel milk cookies. That's had a few million views on Facebook. Wow. So, yeah, they just love sweet treats because they like to tag their friends and share them on Facebook and Instagram. And then they also like easy dinners, like mints and stuff like that as well. I get very stressed cooking. One of those lemon slices right now would help. I know that stress. But it's the timing. Like the individual item's exquisite. But I've got to get them to come out at the right time. Got my tips for that? It is hard to break it down, but that's why I've tried to make my recipes as easy as possible by having really simple methods. So it's easy for everybody to cook it. So it's kind of from young people to older people where anyone can have a go and try the best. And I can't help but notice you've brought something with you. Tell us about that, and how can we make it? So I've bought a lemon weekbook slice slice because the chocolate weekbook slice was so popular that I thought I'd do a lemon version. And here you go. Here we go. I've got some napkins here too. How do you make it? So you just crush up some wheat bicks, put it with some melted butter, some coconut, some baking powder and some flour. Mix that up, bake that in the oven and then make like a zesty lemon icing and ice it. It's super easy. It's kind of like a nostalgic kind of grandma and a recipe. And being lemon, it's healthier too. Yeah, and lemons are in season at the moment, so super easy. Good to get the kids involved as well. I've got a mouthful of food. You've got the ingredients on screen there and there is more info on our Facebook page. You can pick up, why am I doing this with a heart? Pick up her new book. It's called Everyday Favorites, and please thank Barnia. Thank you having me. It's been really nice to meet it. Thank you so much. All right, so you bake some of Vanya's treats and where do you hide them? It's time for beat that. We've partnered with Ben and Jerry's, and their new ice cream pieces is available now. We're looking for the best hiding place for your treats this week. This is yesterday's winner, Kyla. She's got the classic hollowed-out book. We're very impressed with this one, Carla. But you have competition, including from Kevin, who we heard from overnight. Take a look at Kevin's hiding spot. This is good if you're a gardener. Right under the pot and in the container. Good idea. Nice one, Kevin. Let's go to Denise, who shows us her hiding place here. Very comfy sort of a hiding space. Whoa, that's really good. Yeah, isn't that clever? Well done. In a car. Good secret stashes from around New Zealand. But I knew beat that champion tonight is Hayden, who takes the cake with this hiding place that, actually, to be fair. Oh, no, that's good. That's all clean water in there. That's fine. Very little chance, even if you knew about that hiding place, that you would go anywhere near it. No one was, as always. If you think you can beat Hayden, headdry off Facebook page, send us a picture of your secret hiding place. You could win a year's supply of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Stick around. There's more to come on the project. We're back. We're feeling full of dogs. I see I've got you and I'm buying love. Sleep to day. We're back. Give me to roll it. Roll it.

Not a lot of bids so far for the Mark selfie NFT, but get in touch on our Facebook page if you want to chuck some money at it. Well, we are excited about the block, which Mark is also on. It's back on Monday, and Mark's brought a sneak peek of the new season, so take a look. Just over there is your new home for the next 12 weeks. Four three-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouses that when you're finished with them will be some of the most highly specced in the area. I'm going to give you a budget of 150K to do your entire house. 150 grand? That is few. That's a lot. It's a lot of cash. And I think that should be more than enough. In fact, I am so confident that that is going to be enough that this year there will be no bank of mark. Wow. Very controversial. It was just getting far too nervous at auction time. Too much to lose. And a bit of a difference to the block this year. Some familiar faces. Yes, so it's block redemption. So these are contestants who have been on before and they hadn't had a great time. Or they to lose. And a bit of a difference to the block this year, some familiar faces. Yes, so it's block redemption. So these are contestants who've been on before and they hadn't had a great time, or they hadn't done that well, hadn't won anything or what have you. So they've added, I think, for the viewer, if you've been a block faithful, now you're here they are again. So you already have a connection with these people. Yeah, and I think it means there's more jeopardy. So we understand the journey they had last time, it didn't go well. Can they, can they put it right? So it's a whole new, I think, layer that we've been able to show that we've never been able to do. Awesome. Do you have a favourite or can't say? I love them all at my children. Oh, okay, okay. Starts on Monday. Well, we're there as a powerful group of women all over the age of 70, trained for the Waka Armour World Champs in London. We'll meet these amazing ladies tomorrow night. For now, put your hands together, and thank Mark Richardson. Keep it going for Laura Tupo. And our all-new match fit is next on three. We'll see tomorrow night. Good night. I want it."}
