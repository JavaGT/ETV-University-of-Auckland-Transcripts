The first one is the rebalancing of base rates to reflect the same gender payments that a male would get of similar professional roles and responsibilities. That's one that nurses feel more reasonably comfortable with. It is the issue around the back pay that is significantly impacting on nursing. It's $580 million dollars to give in under the Fakhineau-the-Whehung-A-U-Ira. However, it's tepeng-the-pute-the-cuhing the tax taxed-eater, but it's tepenging the the government. In relation to this pay deal, there is no more funding to put into it, and so I hope that the parties can quickly meet, and we can get on and get pay levels to nurses that they have long waited for.

Pneumonia kills children like Emmanuel. Medicines cost just five dollars and could save his life. Amy is fighting for her life from a fever and diarrhea. Just $5 will provide the medical care she needs. Children like tiny, vulnerable Hussana desperately need food. Without it, they will not survive. It really doesn't have to be this way. Save the Children knows what it takes to save lives. It takes us, you and as little as $5 a month. A child dies needlessly every six seconds. Yet with just $5 a month, you can save children's lives.
