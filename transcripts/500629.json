The Playbook contains every scam, con, gambit, flim, flam, stratagem, and bamboozle I've ever used or ever hoped to use to pick up chicks and give them the bids. Oh my god, that's horrible. I wonder if that would work. Listen, there's something I gotta tell you. What? There never was another girl. I kinda made her up. One of the reasons, girls want, like, cuddling in the rain, birds chirping, love, happiness, dancing, you know, like butterflies. I just want, one thing. Stick her boobs out. Show him off. Come on. I think he likes my lips. I think obviously my butt. You're the hottest bitch in his place. You did all this while I was unconscious? Ooh, mm-hmm, yep. Oh my butt. You're the hardest bitch in his place. You did all this while I was unconscious? Ooh, mm-hmm, yep. Oh my god. Oh shit! No, as long as I got someone clean my house and some action on a regular basis, I don't need one. And that's the key is like every rejection, there's still going to be an angle. The girl could say, fuck off, you can still persist, persist, maybe involve a friend, try to do this, try to do that to get her as well. It's like you can always persist and there's always a way to make it happen. Eliminate it from your mind. There's no such fucking thing as rejection. It doesn't exist. I'm going to fight for you. Until your heart stops beating. From what I understand from doctors, that's really, until your heart stops beating. From what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. I knew you take all my honey. You selfish motherfucker. Ron and Samma fight! I got girls cooking me dinner. I've been with you for a year. How many times you cook for me? None, you f***. You're so spoiled, bitch. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's all right because I like you. You're so spoiled bitch! I call her every foul name there. I cannot have that happen again. I'm sorry I shouldn't have flung the light of your head. It won't happen again. I won't get flung the light of your head. It won't happen again. I won't get jealous anymore. Club! There'll be no more DJ. I will kill myself if they're still together. I will kill myself. For me. You won't stay with me any other way. Hello. Ella, please. Jump in, baby! I'm gonna get crazy, alright. How about down here? Is this alright for you? Oh, look at red knickers! Oh my god! I feel like I can really talk to you. Come here, bitch. I want my money back. Fah! Come here, you're fucking... Get you're back! Okay! Ah ha! 50 bucks, that's been a hundred bucks! Where's the rest of it?"}
