Here at the Blind Institute Auckland, the men ply busy needles for the Navy. They're at work on an order for 400 rope fenders. The basis of a ship's fender is a sewn canvas bag, later filled with cork. Skilled hands are busy to on rope landing nets for special use in combat areas. The finished work, nets and vendors pile up. The skill of these men as they weave and knock the ropes over the cork-filled bags is the skill of which they can be justly proud. The day's output finished and up to schedule. To haul a casualty up a 30-foot concrete wall is an easy job to this Army ambulance squad. One man reaches the patient while the others stay on top. A special stretcher made of cane and canvas is lowered and the casualty strapped on securely. The long haul begins. The patient is well protected from head to foot. Three men make fast work of it. Now it's up and over. Here's another problem a field ambulance is likely to encounter in modern fast-moving warfare. Taking a patient up a steep and rugged hillside. The sergeant goes ahead to take the strain. This is going to be a tough climb, but stretcher bearers have to be as tough as any other front line troops. Removing casualties from forward areas calls for speed as well as strength. Taking every advantage of cover, the stretcher bearers get their man to the top. And it's top marks to these boys in training for the real thing. Getting the first army ashore on the North African coast was one problem. Keeping it supplied was another, but the merchant navy did the job, moving into North African ports with a steady flow of munitions. On the Tunisian border, the First Army gathered strength to drive the Axis forces right out of Africa. Nothing stopped the Navy boys. You boats and planes harried them. Even in port they were not safe. But when the planes struck again, the ships hit Army had its problems too. It needed ammunition. Ammunition barges followed it along the coast. At improvised jetty's, soldiers rushed the cases ashore. Rearmed, the 8th Army moved forward again. The natives wished it well and the Europeans cheered it on. For them the day of liberation had arrived, for their compatriots, it would not be long. The RAF were right on top. At 15-minute intervals, hully bombers and fighters swept into the sky, and they swept it clean. With no Luftwaffe in sight, they peel off at a spot of ground strapping. Over the advancing army they race, and in their part, another burning German tank. Then came the bombers, the upper millstone in the grinding of the Axis forces. One and a quarter million pounds of bombs a day was their way of softening the Axis defences. Where they led, the army followed. Between the two the enemy began to crumble. The dramatically tunis fell people were filling the streets as the first army moved in for seven months the people had been waiting for this spectacle as tank As tank followed tank, they became more and more excited. They were free again, they could laugh again. They could wave flags and cheer and shout again. When the army had gone, they still filled the streets. Four days later, the people turned out again to welcome When the army had gone, they still filled the streets. Four days later, the people turned out again to welcome General Giro, administrator of North Africa. His visit signified Tunisia's reunion with the French Empire. From the cathedral steps, General Giro reviewed units of the French and allied armies. On Cape Bon Peninsula, the Axis armies were folding up. Burning their own tanks was the last desperate act of an enemy that had been out-generaled and out-fought. From all directions came prisoners. Some surrender at the revolver point. Some walked carrying white flags. Some rode in trucks. Some just sat and waited to be picked up. Soon they were streaming back to the prison cages. And large cages were needed to accommodate 200,000. But these were not the important prisoners. The fourth Indian division had captured generals Fononim and Kramer. Fononim, in Tope, took leave of his captors before being taken to England by plane. Back in Tunis, the people still celebrated. The soldiers were mobbed whenever they appeared. People still flocked around them to express their gratitude and admiration. Unisier is one. And the people are free again. Yesterday, Africa, tomorrow, Europe."}
