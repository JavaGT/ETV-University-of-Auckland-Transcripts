Days after a damning review into team culture, Glenn Moore sits down with One News and reveals why he's resigning. Ukraine says it's found hundreds more civilian bodies in the Kiev region as Russia hits back with a revenge attack on the capital following the sinking of one of its most important warships. And in East Detroit, New Zealanders are out and about in the first extra long weekend with greater freedoms from egg hunts to fairground attractions. One News is along for the ride. Khaoa good evening. A surprise U-turn in top-level rugby tonight. The Black Ferns women's coach has called it quits, just days after the release of a damning review into the team and its culture. Glenn Moore has been in charge for more than six years, winning a World Cup in 2017, but has decided to resign less than six months out from the next World Cup. For more, let's bring in Andrew Sattel. Yes, Melissa, this has come as a shock for some, for others seemingly inevitable. Given the review findings which were revealed last Monday, given an almost untenable position for Glenn Moore outwardly anyway. Now, when the review was finalised, New Zealand rugby endorsed more as Blackfern's coach. He also said in a statement last Monday, he was committed to improving taking those findings on board. Now just a few days later, he's gone. I sat down with Glenn Moore this afternoon. He confirmed he started considering resigning last Tuesday night, asking himself how on earth it had got to this? Yeah, look, I probably have. And look, I've had a lot of consultation with the people close to me, my partner with my family. But look, at the end of the day, I'm clear in my mind that this team and this group of both coaches who are talented and players need to be able to really be focused in this next six months on winning this World Cup. I'll have more later in sport, including Glenmore's reaction to those allegations made by Blackfern's hooker to Kura Nata Arringamate. Also, what happens now to that coaching role, a role six months out from what is a crucial World Cup, Melissa. Some interesting names in the mix. We'll see you in about half an hour's time. Thanks, Andrew. In other news, the police investigations underway after a person died in a house fire in South Dunedin overnight. Emergency services were called to the Phillips Street home just after 10 last night. One person was found dead at the scene. It's been treated as suspicious, with detectives today on site carrying out a scene examination. To the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Moscow has resumed attacks on the capital Kiev and warned more may come. It's also called for NATO to stop supplying weapons to Ukraine or face unpredictable consequences. Meanwhile, Ukraine now puts the number of civilian deaths near Kiev at around 900, double the previous figure. Simon Mersib has developments. Moscow released this video of an attack on Ukraine's capital. Here's the target, a factory which reportedly made anti-ship missiles. I woke up to the sound of an explosion. I've just passed one aim. My house shook like there was an earthquake. Then I heard more explosions. Moscow says it will attack Kiev again, claiming it's been provoked by Ukrainian terrorism. All this, hours after the sinking of Russia's flagship in the Black Sea, why the Moscow went down is disputed. But in Crimea, Russians mourned its loss. Moscow was a symbol for everyone, says the reserve captain, a symbol of our power, our hope. Russian power was in evidence today in Kharkiv and Ukraine's east. Locals say shells kill seven civilians, including a child. Why do children suffer? And pensioners, she asks. I heard one, two, three, four explosions, this woman says. The shells kept falling during the day. Ukraine says it's still finding bodies of civilians near the capital. Two weeks ago, they'd found 450. I want to say that the number of killed civilians is past 900, and I emphasize these are civilians. Ukraine claims most were executed. 95% of the people were killed by sniper rifles or small arms. The CIA worries Russia may use much more lethal weapons. None of this can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons. There are signs the war may shift Europe's power balance. Russia had warned neutral Finland and Sweden not to join NATO. But reports suggest both countries may now apply for membership as public opinion turns against Russia. Russia keeps tightening its grip on the southern port city of Mariupol. These reserve soldiers are securing areas captured by Russian Marines. That may soon include this huge steel plant. It's seen fierce fighting. Moscow now says it's surrounded. Time may be up for its defenders. Simon Mersep, one news. Among those Ukrainian forces defending Maru Pau is a British man, Aidan Aslan. He's now been captured and his grandmother is calling for him to be treated humanely. Aslan made a video for his family just before having to surrender. The BBC's Emma Vardy reports. If you're watching this, it means that we've surrendered. The last message to loved ones, before his capture in one of the most desperate places on her. Run out of ammunition. Didn't really have any other choice of an end to surrender. For weeks, Aidan Aslin and his unit defended the heavily bombarded city of Mariupol, holding off Russian forces as long as they could. Two days ago, his family received a phone call as he explained they were having to surrender. To lay down our arms and head towards the Russian soldiers. I knew that the ammunition situation was very low and they wouldn't have surrendered if they'd still got ammunition. The next time his grandmother and other family members saw him, it was Aidan in handcuffs, now a captive being paraded on Russian television. I was horrified. Absolutely horrified. My heart stopped. His face is swollen, nasty gash on his cross his forehead. Having seen him, I know he's alive, but I'm not sure if that's comfort because I don't know really how he's been treated. Unlike many other foreign fighters who've travelled to Ukraine, Aidan was no newcomer. He'd become a Marine in the Ukrainian military in 2018. He's engaged to a Ukrainian and had made the country his adopted home. His family say they can only hope for a prisoner exchange. But this conflict is also a battle of propaganda. In which it's clear Aden is now being used by the Kremlin for its own ends. And you can stay right up to date with any developments in Ukraine.

There are fears that a rule requiring political candidates to list a street address on their campaign ads is putting people in danger. The Prime Minister agrees it's a serious problem and a law change could be on the way. Here's senior political reporter Benedict Collins. For Topps O'Hariu candidate in Wellington, having a Dunedin street address on her advertising isn't ideal. I don't really have any connection with Dunedin but all of my promotional materials, my car, everything that has anything to do with me in politics has this Deneiden address on it. That's because our electoral law state campaign ads must come with a residential or business street address so voters know who's behind it. That Deneden office is the only one top's got and with the recent surge in aggression and threats towards politicians, some candidates might not want their actual home addresses widely known. I'm concerned for myself and other people, particularly women, in politics, but also our addresses are not just our own. You know, I live with my children and my partner. Candidates connected to big parties often use electorate or party office addresses. A lot of the people who are in Parliament probably don't understand the risk that independence and people from small parties and people from local government have to take by putting their home addresses out there. Local government elections will be held in October. It seems unhelpful to give people directions to where you might live as a candidate. He's worried it may deter some from standing. We need to be able to make it as safe as we can for people who want to do that. where you might live as a candidate. He's worried it may deter some from standing. We need to be able to make it as safe as we can for people who want to do that. In a recent meeting with the Prime Minister, local government New Zealand raised its concerns that candidates could be harassed at the upcoming election and asked if those rules around the residential address could be changed. In a statement to one news, the Prime Minister said she shares those concerns and she's looking for a solution. Top has one. These days, particularly for younger people, our email addresses are far more stable than our home addresses. Why not have something like that that is more stable and it's actually useful for people who want to contact you? The Electoral Commission says for the street address requirement to go, the law will need to be changed. Benedict Collins, One News. The issue of genetically modified food was once so highly charged, it prompted thousands to protest against the practice. But almost two decades on, pro-GM groups say the benefits have been ignored, and New Zealand is getting left behind because of its rigid stance. Here's Cushler Norman. The Impossible Burger is the newest plant-based patty on the block. It contains a genetically modified ingredient that helps the patty taste and even bleed like the real thing. It's come under criticism, but not to the same extent it might have in the past. We want to be. We're not seeing the public picketing in front of countdown. I feel like this generation is ready for new technologies that we can look at the risk and benefit. In New Zealand, some ingredients of imported foods are genetically modified, and their technology is confined only to labs, like the submissions-busting ryegrass project. Now the Productivity Commission questions whether GM could be used more widely and wants a review of regulations. It's got farmers excited. There's big gains not only for the farmer, but for the environment through use of this technology. It's not about saying let's do it right now. It's let's have this conversation. But others say New Zealand's tight GM controls have served us well. We've had a very good reputation as a clean, safe food producer. The consumer expects the same things now as they did 20 years ago. The GMO. Mother say no. In the early 2000s, the idea of genetic modification provoked protest and anger. Nearly 20 years on, the government is still showing an unwillingness to talk about GM food. There is also still a suspicion about genetically modified food. It's actually something that I share, actually. I think we've got to be very careful in that space, and so we're not contemplating anything there. The government had said it was time for an informed conversation about GM, but now the minister says it will be just about medicines. We're at risk of missing out if we sort of refuse to sort of partake in what the rest of the world's doing, quite frankly. The role of GM in New Zealand's still proving to be a sensitive topic. Kushlan Orman, 1 News. This Easter weekend sees Kiwis enjoying the public holiday with extra freedom at the orange alert level. Some families opted for organised events while many just enjoyed the good weather. But as Jordan Rudd reports, for the littlies, it was all about one thing. Bunny ears on and baskets in hand. These young ones are on the hunt for Easter treats. They're looking for chicks like these ones and then they get at Easter egg. Auckland's North Shore cricket ground filled with keen kids and patient parents, all enjoying a long weekend made sweeter by extra freedom. Yeah, we've been missing it, not finding things to do for the kids and stuff. People feel safer and they feel like they can actually get back to that community spirit that they've been missing. The children, though, here for one reason only. Because it has chocolate. Same. Lod of chocolate! Across town, the Easter family Fun Fest had Green Lane's showgrounds humming with excitement. It was really fun. What, can you tell me what that is? Spider-Man. I was hoping, like anything, I took the punt on, that it would go to orange, but I didn't know what was going to happen. It's not quite the famous Easter show Auckland's used to, but there's something for everyone here at the showgrounds, from the tame tea cups to the terrifying treasure ship. Definitely not for the faint-hearted. I think after lockdown, everyone's just hissing to come out and have fun, so no, it's a good community, family event. In the capital, Wellingtonians made the most of the glorious weather. The order of the day not a surprise. Oh, chocolate. And the whole celebration. The Garden City also received a healthy dose of sunshine to the delight of those at the Easter Carnival. It's fun to have it. We didn't have an AMP show last year, so it's fun and exciting. I play on the bouncy cutters and I bounce. Yeah, I think it's just one big family day that people are enjoying because we haven't done it for a while have we. And Easter all about fun, family and friends after two tough years. Jordan Rudd, One News. Emeri Akenei, after the break, tensions boil over at a famous Jerusalem holy site.

The opening of our borders to vaccinated travellers from Australia is an important first step towards rebuilding our tourism industry. But operators could still have a long wait before visitor numbers recover. Here's our Queensland-based reporter, Jared McCulloch. A special moment for these vaccinated Australians touching down in New Zealand this week. Some waiting years to get here. Our borders now open to our closest neighbours for the first time since last year's short-lived travel bubble. As we go to air, New Zealand is quarantine free for Aussie visitors. The Prime Minister putting the word out on Australian TV, encouraging more to head to our shores. My advice to anyone who's interested in coming over to New Zealand for a spot of skiing is to book. We've seen quite a bit of enthusiasm for this season already. But rebooting our once-thriving tourism industry is going to be a long haul. Queenstown won't get direct flights from Australia until next month. Qantas offering the first service Air New Zealand following suit in June. The airlines are in the same position as all businesses. They're trying to staff up again and trying to recommission planes and things of that nature. And you don't just turn that on overnight. It's a slow trickle. We're not going to lie. It's a long runway we're on here. But we've learnt to be patient. And so signs for us are looking like this next summer season is going to be a lot better. It's a similar feeling too for the glorious West Coast Glacier Country. To be frank, it's going to be a slow burn, and it's going to take time to build confidence, and it will take time to encourage visitors to make their way over to the West Coast. While further north, operators are hoping things will improve quicker. It's looking good for the forward bookings around July onwards, and the market seems to be picking up around that time. Travelers from visa waiver countries may add to that sense of normality next month as New Zealand slowly opens the door to international tourists. Jared McCulloch, One News. Weeks of tension between Jews and Christians in Israel have come to a head with clashes between Palestinians and police at a Jerusalem mosque. Police say more than 150 people were injured after they entered the Al-Akska Mosque to break up a crowd which had thrown rocks onto Jewish worshippers at the nearby Western Wall. BBC's Yulan Nal has more. Israeli police say they moved in to disperse a riot by Palestinian Muslims at Alaksa Mosque. Officers fired stun grenades and rubber bullets. Palestinians threw stones and firecrackers. The violence came inside the doors of the mosque. It takes hours for a fragile calm to set in, and we meet Omar joining the cleanup. He came for Ramadan prayers. You just want to pray, and it's really heartbreaking to see one of your holy sites. You come like eight or kilometers away just to get this type of behavior against you. Nearby, it's a special day for Christians. Thousands have come for Easter and to walk the traditional way of the cross. Well, it's a miracle to be here and to share this Holy Friday with all the people and to pray for everybody. But for now, those prayers aren't answered. The overlapping religious holidays were always going to raise tensions here in the old city. People of different faiths are celebrating, but these narrow streets feel more on edge after the recent deadly violence and today's clashes. Elsewhere in Jerusalem, a Jewish ritual. Families are burning the bread banned during Passover, which begins tonight. Ilana says the holidays overshadowed by attacks in Israel, which have killed 14 people. You can't help thinking what will be the passive experience of those families who weren't expecting to have one person left at their table. This should be a joyful time for Palestinians and Israelis, but instead it's an uneasy one. Traditionally, the Notre Dame Cathedral would be swamped this time of year by tourists flocking to Paris. Instead, the French Prime Minister and his wife were special visitors checking on the huge reconstruction project after the cathedral was largely destroyed by fire three years ago. And forget the East Bunny, Manuel Macron, got his hands on a statue of a gold rooster, which could adorn the top of the arch once it's reconfigured. Notre Dame is due to reopen to the public in 2024. That's in time for the Paris Olympics. It was a very different scene in the Czech Republic where marches made a real Easter spectacle of themselves. People of all ages took to the streets and masks and black outfits pushing big wooden raffles or banging drums. According to tradition, the noise scares away Judas, the apostle who betrayed Jesus. For the first time in two years, the pandemic didn't impact on the Good Friday March. Also returning is the Easter egg roll, a White House tradition.

Your Honor Arnold, it's one of the most common cancers in young people, but research into brain cancer has been limited. Now, patients at Adenbrook's Hospital in Britain are having the entire genetic code of their tumours sequenced in the hope of improving diagnostic accuracy. Now just a warning, this report from the BBC's Fergus Welsh includes pictures of brain surgery. Daniel is just 34. He's on his way to theatre for brain surgery. I think that's a bit I'm most scared about as being awakened. I've been someone surrounded around in my head. Daniel has a large brain tumor, the round white area at the top of this scale. Okay, starting. To begin with, Daniel is fully anesthetized while surgeons remove part of his skull. But once his brain is exposed, he's woken up and must be kept awake. Daniel, how are you feeling? Before removing each piece of tumour, surgeons need to be sure it won't affect Daniel's speech or his ability to move his body. So at each step, the team checks his responses. Well done, man. Part of Daniel's tumor will be sent for whole genome sequencing. Its entire DNA will be mapped. What that means is essentially we're looking at the abnormalities in the genes that we think caused the tumour in the first place. So we're really able to drill down into the molecular problems in the tumour. Just two weeks after surgery, Daniel returns to Adam Brooks to receive his results. This is a diagnosis that is treatable, but it's not a curable condition. So this is something that will be life limiting. About 50% of people survive for 15 years or more. But I think it's important that you understand this isn't something that's going to go away. Wow, I don't know what to say. Sure. You don't have to say anything. Enjoyed the next 15 years in my life. Life is very short, so I want to make the most of it. I just want to get the treatment I can to prolong my life like six weeks of radio therapy, five days a week. More than 200 brain tumor patients are taking part in the research. With the hope, it may eventually yield new, personalized treatments which improve outcomes. And the latest figures from here show that 293 people died in New Zealand from brain or central nervous system cancer in 2020. All the brilliant night skies above Kaikora are on the path to becoming an international dark sky reserve with plans to apply for recognition later this year. The town's mission to reduce light pollution isn't just about stargazing but also a bid to save a very special local seabird. Joy Reid with the story. As Kokoda's beauty fades into darkness, celestial wonders appear above it. It's clear, and so you can see a lot of things. The Milky Way is the most spectacular part of that. Kakoda's motivation to protect its picturesque night scape is twofold. How's he looking? No damage. You're looking pretty good. Volunteers roam the streets at this time of year rescuing dozens of hut and shearwaters, an endangered native seabird. Kormick saw the bird at the window and started going, Bird, bird, bird! The birds are only found in the Kikota ranges and on their maiden flight they can become disorientated by the town's lights and crash land on the road, mistaking it for the ocean, particularly on misty nights. It's always underneath the lights. It can be fatal, but those that are rescued are given a safe bed for the night. Does it make sure his head's all good. And a full check checkup at dawn. This would have been its first flight, and it got confused with the lighting in the town, and rather than going straight to the ocean, it's ended up on the road. The town's already replaced its streetlights, but it's on a mission to go one step further and become an international dark sky reserve to protect not just the birds, but it's night sky as the town develops. 80% of the world suffers from light pollution, but here in Kaikoda, the dark sky quality is said to be just as good, if not better, than that of Aoraki McKenzie's International Dark Sky Reserve. We're in this black part of the South Island. Interior to us, there is no light. It's all black wilderness. Absolutely fabulous night sky wilderness. That beauty, if recognized, could attract a new astro tourism industry. It will put bums and seats, if you will. Motels, hotels, people coming and give you a longer stream of income. It's hoped the international Dark Sky Reserve application will be submitted later this year. We're not going to be in the dark. This is about responsible lighting. Reducing light pollution, key to protecting Kaikoda's natural taunga. Joy Reid, One News. Our saves back with more on the underfire Blackthirms coach. He's resigned.

No, Mike, no, Kordidoha, Kna, Kna, Kna, Otewa. Welcome to Sport tonight. And the rugby news of the day, the resignation of Black Fern's coach Glenn Moore. As we reported earlier on One News, just days after saying he'd stay on in the job with New Zealand rugby's backing, Moore has stepped down. I sat down with the departing coach this afternoon and started by asking him why the abrupt change of mind. I don't know that there was a key moment. I mean, I could see, and I was hearing some of the build up to it, and my mind was firmly on what I think needed to be done for the team and to give them the best opportunity, and that's where I ended up making my decision off. Some of the allegations in this report, the body shaming, the ghosting, to Kuta was picked quote only to play the guitar. What do you say to those allegations? Well look, I think first and foremost I never think like that. That's not my values, that's not my beliefs. How much impact on the game, how much impact on you has that one social media post had? I don't think it's just about me, Saf. I think it's about other people around me that have actually had to witness that and take on board that. And by that I'm talking about, you know, family members, my ageing parents, my kids, my partner, you know, all those things. So, yes, it's had an impact on me, but the hardest part is watching what it does to them. What's it done to them? Oh, look, it's been very upsetting for them. Very upsetting for them. You've obviously hired a private PR firm to help you. Why did you think you had to do that? Look, I've talked to many people, not just to people that are assisting me, like a PR person, all that sort of stuff. I mean, the advice I was given that I should be utilising people like that. It's quite surprising given New Zealand rugby has their own media division. Did you think you've been left out on a limb? Look, I felt that I needed to make sure that I had some people that I could talk to as well, and that's what I chose to do. The speed at which the women's game has developed, have the resources and money kept up with that? Well, we'd... No, I don't think it has, and I think most people, even people at ENZDAR, would say that. So where to... For Glen Moore from here? It's a great question. I'm not sure. It's all pretty fresh this week, so... And raw? And raw, yeah, yeah. Sad. With Glenn Moore stepping away, one news can reveal his assistant former all-black scourri, Wayne Smith, will put his hand up to lead the Black Ferns to the World Cup if needed. That news, as well as Moore's resignation, filtering through the rugby community late this afternoon, giving key figures plenty to chew over. Matt Manukia has more. Glenn Moore is actually one of three Blackfern's coaches slash staff to leave six months from the World Cup, which is why Wayne Smith will put his hand up to lead the team and what could go down is one of the great World Cup stories should they win. Smith is currently an assistant and wouldn't appear on camera, but told one news he's committed to doing anything the team needs, including head coach. There's something fresh, you know, had the same coach for the last six and a half years. So having Wayne Smith come in now is, like you said, so close to World Cup, it's fresh, it's new ideas. But World Cup winner, Christina Sue, like many other figures in the game, says the long-term solution will be the development of female coaches. You know, Whitney Hansen has been an internship involved in. What about Victoria Grant who's already there? The Black Ferns want the new head coach locked in before their next camp on Thursday. Whoever it is, must close the gap on European nations whose on field improvement is a result of extra funding and resource. A major area, the recent review, found New Zealand rugby let the Black Ferns down. Women's Rugby and the Black Ferns were in the community rugby section, along with school girls, club. Do you know, and it just goes to show how far behind we are in a results driven business a lot will hinge on how the black ferns perform come the world cup despite all that controversy right now where it sits and we know our black ferns need a focus on on the world cup that's what we'll hold and bind them together is the leadership within that group it's fantastic this is an opportunity for us to open a new chapter for women in rugby in Ontario. Because as we've seen, their raw talent will only get them so far. Matt Manukia, One News. To the men's game, an 18-year drought is over, and the blues have proven they are the real deal. They've beaten the Crusaders and the game of the season so far, holding on in that thriller in Christchurch. The result taking the Blues to the top of the Super Pacific ladder and while there's more games ahead this weekend, those results won't change the current top four. The Blues win their first over the Crusaders in Christchurch since 2004. Here's Guy Havelte. Defense, defiance, delight. It's taken almost two decades, but the Blues finally have the scalp they wanted. Blues don't end of touch. And at long last, the drought is over. It's been a pretty big monkey that we wanted to get off our chest. What a game. For 80-tenths, tight minutes it delivered in every facet. Match-clinching tackles from the players the game needed. No, no! What a defense! What an amazing defense from the Blues! To a match-altering one from one of the Crusaders' biggest names. Oh, no. Oh, boy. Scott Barrett likely eyeing a suspension, Blues prop Alex Hodgman facing time on the sidelines too, after some uncomfortable scenes. The rules, eh? He's got to be better technically and we'll see what happens this week. It definitely felt momentum swing our way. An almost instantaneous swing at that, with Barrett joining the Sinbind David Havili off the park, the Crusaders down to 13, the Blues using it to their advantage. Eklund has a go for the line. Can he get it down? Yes! This is a massive moment in the game. Half an hour to go, a 14-point lead, that long sought-after Christchurch win within reach. But beware of the down-and-out team in red and black. Sarah races it again! Oh, what a game we have a land! A surging last 25 minutes, but beware of the down-and-out team in red and black. A surging last 25 minutes, camping on the Blues line for the dying stages. This time though, against 18 years of history, the Blues holding on. There's still a long way to go in this comp and, you know, we want to be there at the final. So to the top, the trans-Tasman champions go, reigniting super rugby at the same time. Guy Havaltwan News. Good timing for sure. The next generation of one of the most famous names in New Zealand sport has made his super rugby debut. Nico Jones, son of all black's great Sir Michael, starting an open side for Moana Pasfika against the Chiefs in Hamilton today. Not exactly the result he was after, though. The Chiefs literally running away with fingers. Gets them all away beautifully. Antenina Maikuro. Get going to the top. That is magic. What have we just seen? Alex Nakivu is going to get a second. 45-12 win, moving the Chiefs up to fifth on that Pacific ladder. Well, from home comforts to home advantage, the Wellington Phoenix soaking in every detail of being back here. Tomorrow's match in Wellington, a great chance to push for playoff contention in the A-League, but also an opportunity to create another special day in the club's history. Dewey Priest was at Phoenix training today. Whether it's the first hug from mum and dad or the first visit back to their actual home ground. It just brings back a lot of good memories that we've had here at this stadium and hopefully we can create a few more. The Wellington Phoenix couldn't come home soon enough. When we departed Wellington back in October and November, we were expecting to come back early in the new year. So there's a mixture of relief and obviously excitement. It's Piscopal! parted Wellington back in October and November. We were expecting to come back early in the new year. So there's a mixture of relief and obviously excitement. This was the atmosphere when the Phoenix last played in Wellington. A memory etched in the mind of standing skipper Olly Sale. Once this bay gets filled up right here, it's an incredible atmosphere. They're very loud and boisterous bunch and I can't wait to see them all tomorrow. It's going to be fantastic. But it definitely adds a lot extra for these boys. It's been almost a year since the Phoenix players last laced up their boots here in the capital, but more than 900 days since they last lost a fixture here and keeping this place a fortress high on the priority list. It's a difficult place to come and play. Any opposition players will tell you that when the winds howling like this and a bit of sideways rain, hopefully not tomorrow. Sunday's fixture, not just a club reunion, but a chance at on-field revenge. Just 11 days ago, they were outclassed 5-0 by Central Coast. We know what to expect from the Mariners, and yeah, they touched us up last time, so we owe them one. And as if they needed any reminders of the hidden benefits of being home... Coincidentally, I actually ran into my brother and hit my oldest brother and his wife at our hotel this morning. He's staying in the same residence and that was just by pure chance. Now to leave nothing to chance out on the field. Dewey Priest's One News. Welcome back Kniepaw fans and also welcome back to the teams after a three-week COVID break. The stars and the tactics, finally taking the court in Christchurch today in front of a unrestricted crowd. Among the players affected by the virus, stars mid-quarter Mila Raoulou Buchanan that didn't stop her from putting together a player of the game performance, assisting the Aucklanders to a dominant 63 6331 win over the tactics. It's all on for a quarter action. There she is spoiling it again for the stars and they'll execute again through Mila Ruehalu de Cannon. It's all on for a rematch. The two teams will meet again this Wednesday. If the Panthers still needed to prove they're the best team in NRL rugby league, they've gone and provided some fairly solid evidence just days after inking a new five-year deal with Penrith. Nathan Cleary Masterclass helped his team deal to the Broncos 40 points to 12. Straight back on the inside of you. Command performance from Sorensen. Cleary from the box and now has kicked to Taylor Bay. What a side? The entertainers. Benritt, the best show in town. Yes, that performance brings the Panthers to 20 straight wins on home turf, equaling a record set by Manly more than 50 years ago. The Warriors playing, equaling a record set by Manly more than 50 years ago. The Warriors playing, I think it's the roosters tomorrow, trying to make it four wins in a row. All right. Is this the year? Jury's out on that. I'll let you know tomorrow. Okay, good-o. Thanks, Chris. Coming out, Chris is here with your Easter Sunday outlook. Happy Easter.

We saw a few showers tracking up and over Canterbury. Those are heading to Wellington later tonight. And a week trough brought a few showers to the Western Bay of Plenty. Let's take a look at Easter Sunday. Fine, mostly. The only spot really lighting up on the rain radar, Northland. So what's going on? A complex low approaches from Sunday. Shows turning to rain during the afternoon. And heavy falls, maybe some thunder as well into the evening for Kaitaya and Russell. You've got a high of 22 and 21 degrees, respectively. Fittieranga reaching 21 degrees. Mostly cloudy, isolated showers in Auckland, easterlies becoming strong and exposed places north of Thamaki Makoto. You're getting to a high of 23 degrees, and Kikidoh Hamilton. 22 degrees, a fraction cooler. Looking fine though, an evening cloud with some easterly winds. Similar story through here. Fine light winds, partly cloudy. Rotorua, Taupo, getting to a high of 19 degrees there. Tomeranui, high of 22 degrees. And as we have a look to Tauranga, partly cloudy, some light winds and easterlies from midday. You're getting to a high of 22 degrees. On the east coast, cloudy periods through the region, a few showers in the morning during those Easter egg hunts, 19 degrees, and Gisbon Napier, and Hastings getting to a high of 18 degrees. Pretty nice picture through here as well. Fine apart from some morning cloud, Sao Easterlies developing early on. New Plymouth 22, Funganui 23 and 20 degrees for Levin. Looking nice there. Wellington areas of morning cloud, those will burn off and then you're left with a nice afternoon. You've got a high of 17 degrees and much of the same at the top of the South Island. Fine light winds, a wee bit of drizzle early on in Kaikota. You've got a high of 15 degrees, Westport, fraction warmer on 20 degrees. Autotahi Christchurch, cloudy, light winds, drizzle in the morning, reaching a high of 15 degrees. And it's fine through here, a few clouds, light winds, easterly breezes, possible morning drizzle for Ashburton and Timor. 15 degrees for you guys and Greymouth, 19 degrees. Queensland, a bit frosty, two degrees overnight. Fine, though, light winds. You will eventually climb to a high of 16 degrees, and in the Lower South Island, it's mainly fine. Temperatures, mid-teens, 14 for Oamudov, Milford Sound 16, and 15s for gore and invocardal. Dunedin, looking good, too. South-West tillies, breezes, they're going to die out, but the nor eastiles are going to develop in the afternoon. Pretty fresh along the coast. You've got a high of 14 degrees, and as we have a look ahead to Monday. Remember that complex low at the top of the North Island we were talking about a little bit earlier? That's going to continue to sink down on Monday and through to Tuesday as well. So heavy rain watch for Northland. South Island is mainly fine. You're just going to keep an eye out on some strong winds in coastal parts of Southland. Tuesday, it's back to work. Rain or showers from Northland to Taranaki across to Gisbon as well, cloud increasing elsewhere. And for the South Island showers in the north and the south. Fine through Canterbury. That is your weather for Saturday. Happy hunting for Easter eggs, Melissa. I've got a great spot in the basil bush, bountiful basil bush. I know I need to bring you some pesto soon, but great spot.
