Break Zapp. I've got to take cover here. This is insane. You can't take it like this. Chatham performs. Do what happened. A delicate operation. Whoa, whoa, watch back. And an overturned tanker. That's big leag. Fire. Fire department. Let's loose. That's a big lady. Fire. Fire, fire. Let's lose. That's like the weather for him. Guess it was wrong. There's no-no April, driver. Spring is just a couple of weeks away. Oh, yeah, that's a real bad out here. But in southwestern Ontario, March is still alive. She's pretty nice up here. By morning, the storm has passed, and the snow is already melting away. We might stop and if you need to stop. But the damage is done. Oh, that's harsh. There's another accident up here. At least you kept it up, right? Unbelievable. Fighting me way too much. it shouldn't be doing that. On the 401 near Ingersoll, their renders is an hour deep into a losing battle. I got a jackknife tractor trailer. Facing the wrong way, and I got to get the front end spun around so I can recover it the rest of the way. It just doesn't want to work. Solid ice out here. And nobody's moving over for us. I see treacherous roads. There's cars and trucks in the ditch everywhere. I've done everything I can. But as the temperature again drops below freezing, the semi is locked hard into the frozen ground. When I first got there, I tried the rear axle, hoping that I could spin it around. But when I started to pull there, it went closer into the trailer, causing more damage. Now he's fighting with a front end, and to get the angle he needs, he's been forced to improvise. I went to a home street 150 feet off the road. I'm trying to redirect the front end. Get it to come out. No, I'm going to lose my truck. This thing spun around 180 degrees, and he's stuck in frozen wood. I can gonna lose my truck. This thing spun around 180 degrees and he's stuck in frozen wood. I can't move this truck. Damn it! On North America's busiest highway, closure is not an option. Roads are a mess. Just to the west, some help is pulling onto the scene. Ross Services lead operator, Mike Ross. No or nothing someday. We'll have a look. Okay, I grabbed the front rim, trying to spin it around, but still wants to turn my truck. When Michael got there, I felt relieved. He's one of the best operators I know. It's lifting my truck off the ground. He had to work off the shoulder there. It's a tough job for the one truck. Mike's going to grab the back of the truck and give it a little pull. Hopefully we can get it spun around. I'll see what it does. As Michael's pulling the back, I'm still hooked onto the tree up on the hill. So I still have the front axle, and I'm spinning it around to face the right direction. Okay, can you straighten your wheel out a little bit. Looking better. Yeah, I think we're done all we can do there. They wrenched the front axle from the frozen mud. I gotta go and get that. I'll tuck it over another three feet, I guess. But they still need to direct the tractor onto the road. Yeah? Yeah. And as they re-rig, drivers are getting careless. Get over, you stupid ass. An idiot! Unbelievable! On this icy road, any distraction could lead to disaster. Other people driving down the road are looking at the wreck that's in the ditch. They're not looking in front of them. They can rear-end this tractor trailer and cause a catastrophe. Make sure they're even. Turn your wheel, buddy. Turn your wheel. And as they begin, the final pull... One distracted driver decides to get a closer look on foot. Blocks the whole highway. This guy blocks a whole lane to take pictures of his partner. This guy stopped in the driving line. Do we need to get off the road? I don't know. You'd think that was common sense that that isn't a good idea, but some people, I don't. Almost got them out. He was pulling it back sideways. Once we got the truck on the road, it felt awesome. All right, we're out of here. As the driver rolls his semi-away, the crew's next job is already waiting. We got this guy out, but the day is still going to be long. We're right, lane, supposed to be driving. I'll do that. Two rag lanes open driving. Copy that, thank you. 90 miles down the 401. It's a little bit worse out there because the wind's blowing a little far. The final traces of last night's storm have blown through. What are you going out of here? We got out here? We got to help the race in the middle of the road. And on the westbound highway near Tilbury, one semi-driver is on his way for treatment following a bad rear-end collision. He's in pretty rough shape, so hopefully he pulls through. After a busy night on the road, Chatham Toings Trevor Gerard is facing one of his worst scenarios. The way I understand the traffic was stopped, the gentleman in the rear tractor, I guess, either did see it or something went wrong anyway. This is the end result. It never gets easy seeing a cab demolished like this. We're gonna put a hold on the truck itself. Okay. The OPPs have put a hold on the actual tractor unit until they're done their investigation. So Trevor and crew will need to preserve the truck itself. Okay. The OPPs have put a hold on the actual tractor unit until they're done their investigation. So Trevor and crew will need to preserve the tractor as is. It'll complicate the job. It's a fairly big cleanup. It's going to take considerable time. But Trevor understands the importance of finding out exactly what happened. My wife is a professional truck driver, so it's always in the back of my mind now. You know, I hope you never get that phone call, you know, it's happened to your love one. Today, the Chatham crew is stretched in. The second axle's even knocked out, Ron? Is it the second one, too? Yeah. His crew is busy across the region, but Trevor's got one veteran backing him up. I got Ron Arts out with me. He's been helping John for longer than I've been here than I've been here just about 30 years. Looks like a lot of steel foraging heavy stuff, special order. It's on a four axle trailer, so it's a heavy load. I'm the last call. If John's really stuck, he calls me. We've got the OK to begin our process on the one. They're still investigating the truck that caused it. So at least now we can get started, get this cleaned up as fast as we can't. We're going to chain this back axle. It took the hardest impact, obviously, so. Not going to be pretty, but we'll get her off the road. Just give me a little tension to see if that hook will set. They just need the axle to hold long enough to limp the trailer off the highway. Put a binder now? We can't. Beautiful. That's got it, Trev. Hey. Want to pick up some of these blocks? Start swinging them up there. You have to get them towards the front, though, right? Yeah, we're just way right to the front. But before they can move the first truck, they need to clear the spilled cargo. A dozen pieces of awkward, heavy steel. I want to get it down at this end. Okay, the pin puller, and then drop the chain and then slide the... Yeah, left her. We come up with the idea of using a pry bar so we can try and use a strap around them, but they're anywhere from, you know, five to a thousand pounds a piece. There's definitely time consuming. Just get out of there, Ron. It's going through the back of your head, right? How are we going to do this? We've got two guys here. Where's these other guys at? I don't know. Ridiculous. Well, they're going to go. 4-1 shut down. The police, they want it open. Here we got this basically, it looks like an explosion that's happened. Yeah, why's the other guy's going to be back here? We've got to do something here because we've got to get this clean up. Like, it's being wrong out here, and that's it. We need people out here. See, what's about, I get that messed up to you? This is just, fact, that's like crazy. This was one of the biggest and best kept secrets of the Third Reich. Thousands of forced laborers die in these tunnels. You're planning something big. Death and destruction. What secret are they trying to hide here? It's a heck of a place to hold off an army and fight to the end. Was it, Hitler's headquarters? Secret and ante bases tonight on Duke and TV and Z plus. All right, I'm up. Who are you off to? To get the flu jab? You coming? I won't get the flu. Touch wood? That's not wood. That's a polyvinyl composite. Still not woods. See there'll be new strains of blue spreading around. The board has reopened. It will be right. That's wood. Yep Kuro. Apparently now that we're out of our bubbles, there's a bigger chance of people catching the flu. None of us so. Touch wood. Hmm. That's somewhat untypical. That's not your word. Out! Kiyolah! You're here for the flu jab! What? Don't leave it to chance here for the flu jab. Don't leave it to chance. Get the flu jab. Visit your doctor or pharmacy or call 0800-6111-116. Romance is blooming. We're on a date, chopping dates. And hearts are breaking. They're sticking. Doesn't want to come out. This is really bad. So will the judges feel the love? It's not a sexy dish to me at all. MasterShiv fans and faves. Tonight, 730 on 2 and on TVNZ Plus. Giving out tickets. I'm going to send you a ticket for speeding. Just got to watch that speed, mate. And another gift these drivers weren't expecting. Just one minute, mate. Just grab something. 107 Otero. Thursday on 2 and on TV and Z Plus. No, we got a wreck up here. Anybody know how to get around this? This is getting right here, Ron? Yeah, right in there. On the westbound 401, Trevor and Ron are scrambling to clear scrap from the brutal rear-end collision. So right, but that tire and that skid? And hoping some relief arrive soon. There's only two of us here. You're going to keep working as fast as you can and productive as you can, but you're wondering how long free backup shows up. I don't know what other ones we can get under and lift. As the police finish investigating on scene, Trevor needs to clear the two trucks. You want to back up and I'll set the axle on you? Sure. But they need the tractor kept as is. They don't know if this guy is going to pull through or not. So now they want to kind of keep the actual tractor unit intact. Are you actually doing the mapping? No, Josh is going to do the mapping right now? Police collect all the evidence they can at a crash site before vehicles are moved. If we clear the scene and want to come back later, that evidence will be gone and it will certainly not be admissible in court. So if they require further investigation on a vehicle, they need to preserve its condition. We need to make sure that the evidence that we have on scene is collected and maintained we don't want to have it compromised that's crazy it lifted the cab right over the airship today it'll be an added complication for a short-handed crew that's probably a tough one pull on it some work and it's starting to get dark and Trev and I are oh what are we gonna do here well let's just keep doing what we do it I'm still short in manpower I can't get an ETA on any help so it's it's not good right now where's these other guys that it's crazy 90 miles east It's greasy. 90 miles east. No, and take your time there, he's about. The storm has left its mark around London. And on a county road, north of town, look like a truck rolled over. Ross Service's veteran veteran Dave Moss. Hello, sir. Has been called out of retirement once again. How much he's in it, Austin? Roughly 15 to 20,000 liters. To help Austin Hutchinson get a fuel tanker back on its wheels. Obviously, you have to worry about a spill. Where this accident has happened, it's right on a bend. It's kind of an S curve. When the tanker crossed into the oncoming lane, the driver tried to correct and the shifting weight of the liquid load slammed his truck over. How much road crash did we get? Much? I can't see it. There's probably a certain amount of road rash to the side of the tank. Because it's laying flat on the road, it's hard to determine how bad that damage is. Want to try and maybe get one up here on the front? We'll put one on the... Because we can get frame up here. Yeah. Dave will pull down on the underside while Austin helps lift and then catch the truck as it rolls. And as they start rigging, owner David Ross has joined the fight. This is a big four-axil tank. We're fortunate. Both 75-ton rotators were available. So Austin is working under the two most experienced operators in the company. Is it so slippery out here? You don't know until you start pulling out. These are going to be cash lines. Austin's doing a good job. He's not a senior driver at our place, but he's very capable. But as a single dad and a provider, Austin is highly motivated to work his way up. Do you want your men? Here. Here. Some days it's a challenge, but I wouldn't trade it. I don't want my hands cold on. At some point or another, I need to step up and take on a bigger roll to fill the void of some of these other guys that are going to start stepping away from the business. Hang on tight. As the sun goes down... You need more strap, David? Yep. Okay, give her a pull. Yeah. Austin is rigged up and ready. That's good. The straps underneath, that's going to be our lifting point. We're going to catch with our two lines going over the top. But the boss sees a problem. I'm concerned about this pipe coming this into the manifold. That manifold, a mean manifold for all the belts. They need to re-rig. Well, let's go behind and hang around on the St Spring. Go right around the spring in front of the... Well... Yeah. My big operators make million-dollar decisions. And they got to make them quick. Go right here. Mm-hmm. How about right here? It's not something you can sit down and draw out or something. It's right now. It's right now time. We'll put us somewhere, but we'll be there. We're on a strap between the rims. He's one of those guys that's been in the business for so long, and he has done so many recoveries that it's always good to have an extra set of eyes. Okay. All right, let's take these lines up one at a time. We're just starting to take some of the straps here. We're getting ready to make a lift. As they begin that lift, no one knows just how much hidden damage the tank has suffered. Right now it's not leaking, but as soon as you twist a little bit on the tank, if it's very thin where it's been rubbing on the ground, it can split open and leak the product out. OK, can you pull on the front axle? And as they make the first small move. Tell the fire guys, here for a minute. Fire. Fire department to David. We're happy with the way it's coming up. Hang on a minute, Dave. That's a big leap. And then we see the leak. We got a gun shoot. Minute by minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up, back up. Oh my, my, but you're going to get your help. Experience one hectic. Some planting coming in in the town centre. Real life hour. Very, very vulnerable situation. We followed some intelligence to all regress. On Britain's front lives. Stop challenging. It's been stabbed. Police officers come open the door! Police hour of duty, tonight on Duke and on TV and Z plus. I'd like a bar of chocolate please. Your change.

Probably shouldn't be eating fish and chips. They'll give it all they've got. For that 80 minutes, you're not friends, you're not brothers. We've got to go to that dark place, we've got to get up and go again. And again. The final of East Coast Rising, Thursday on 2 and on TV and Z Plus. On a county road north of London. You're going to have a big flood here. It's in the middle of the tank, that's where it's coming. The damaged tanker is gushing fuel. It's a significant leak. It gets pouring out pretty good. Oh yeah, she got a good hole in. Come on, let's go. Hey, them up. Yeah, keep them other two loops. We need to get this truck on its wheels so that we can got a good hole in. Come on, let's go. Hey, come up. Yeah, keep them other two loves. We need to get this truck on its wheels so that we can get this leak stopped. The pressure's on. How you doing, Dee? Fine. Get them lines all tight up there. We're going to put it up now, okay? Once it's in the air, you're pretty much committed to what you're doing. Okay, keep going. Load it up? Is your blue one all the way? No. Stick it out. As the tanker nears the upright position, it will be up to Austin to take over with the catch line and set it down. You want a smooth transition. You don't want any crashing and banning when you got flammable products. Just keep them all the ones stuck till I time. Keep going. Don't stop. Do you want me keep lifting? Keep lifting till I tell you not. I'm out or red? Hold it there. Because of the product that's in it, it's liquid. So, like, when you start to roll it, like, it's like a bucket of water. Get this one tight. Keep going. It sloshes, and you can flip them right back over the other way. Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch back. Hey, she's coming down, boys. Put her down. Okay. All him. Better down on the back. Come down, yep. That's fast. There, goes right there. She's back on the wheels. She's a little bit more messy than we would have liked, but we definitely won the battle. And with the truck upright, the fuel has settled below the puncture. Well, it's not there now. Oh, has it? As a truck comes down, and the fuel stops leaking. You guys did a pretty good job? Yeah, it's not even down the ditch. Austin did a fine job. Yep. And he had two of the old school people with him. It's a solid victory for two operators at opposite ends of their careers. I can go back home where I belong. I should be able to hook that there, Dave. These guys have been in the business for a long time. They've built a very reputable name for themselves. All right, man. Okay? Yep. He really tries to do a good job. Some of the people just want to work to five o'clock and go home. Well, Austin doesn't. I'd like to keep doing what I'm doing and just try to bring as much as I can to the table to help them and continue to grow my own set of skills. Okay, thanks for the help. I'm definitely really happy to be at Ross. It feels like home. Traffic complete, request bound, to get a unit to a notch. That, boy. 90 miles east. Look, you don't worry about it. Let them, let it through. As evening pushes in tonight. Keep them coming, guys. Terry Schmidt and police from multiple forces are out on the road in Etobico, working to get impaired drivers off the road. Any alcohol drink? No. Can you alcohol drink? No, no. All right. Drive safely, okay? Thank you so much. So we're doing a ride check, and you'd be amazed how many times we'll find drivers who have either been out drinking or, you know, taking something that's impairing themselves, a drug. The ride is reducing impaired driving everywhere. Tonight, they're already making an impact. Is this your car, my friend? A little too many of a drink? No, I didn't think so. I actually thought about walking. Yeah, that would have been a good idea. And now this will kind of sit with you for a while. When you start drinking, you're not able to objectively look at yourself to determine whether or not you are safe and ready for the road. One of my sons is a police officer. Okay, oh boy. Yeah, this won't go over real. If you've been drinking, just make that decision, make that promise, aim for zero. We demand and expect drivers to make good decisions. Continuing to drive just puts themselves, their passengers, and obviously everybody else on the highway at risk. And police will be out long into the night, looking for drivers who aren't making those good decisions getting alcohol drink please thank you thank you drive safe 200 miles southwest traffic's backed up huge over there traffic has been crawling off the 401 and onto detour routes for over six hours. And with Trevor and Ron prepping to start the main recovery, the rest of the crew has finally started to arrive. Oh, man. What a bad thing? You don't believe it. Led by Chathamoner, John Verkitt. When I first come at the scene and seen what happened, then you used to say, God, not another one like this. Do you want to go behind a cab, or what are you thinking, or just grabbed there? Front corner of the trailer. The trailer, get it all up. All right. We're going to attempt to pull the truck in the trailer up you gotta kind of be nice to it because it's the hold on they did not want anything touched of the cab because sometimes we take the cab off or or squeeze it down the tractor is critical to the OPP investigation so I'm wrapping around the outside of the training mount motor mount oh yeah but just separating it from the trailer could tear it apart. I'm going to put most of the force on the trailer, pull-wise. I'll see what happens here. This tractor itself is so demolished. I'm unsure at this point if this frame is going to stay together? Slight, good. There she's out. Plan A work. To pull a tractor out. Here we go. It's free of the trailer. The tractor is so badly mangled. But now, they have to somehow move it off this road. We couldn't put it on our float because it was too high. But if we take the boom, we just lower it. There's a hold on. Yeah. He said we can go. Well, there's not much way you can't. You can we take the boom, and just lower it. There's a hold on. Yeah. He doesn't mind. He said, if we can, don't. Well, there's not much where you can't, you can't take it like this. It's one hurdle after another with this wreck. It's fighting right to the end. I don't know. Go for zero zero pretty quick, right? Damn. Step aside, please, gentlemen. What was the nature of your trip? Was it for business or pleasure? That's not what you're thinking. Funny kind of hairdryer. Nice to speed go. Filthy. It's dirty, actually. You, Robocop. Remove your helmet. Right there. New Top Gear UK starts Thursday the 21st of July. Everywhere in New Zealand. And you can watch us on Duke. Protect your things and the life they bring you. AMI insurance on your side The fourth extraordinary group of people I know you want to buy this is genius You can't see me But I always Be heard Everything about it was astonishing The fourth semi-final of Britain's Got Talent Friday on 2 and on TV and Z Plus Can you confirm if the westbound land is shut down? On the 401 outside Tilbury, westbound traffic has been shut down for close to seven hours. And the Chatham crew can't clear the road until they move the tractor. You can't take it like this. We couldn't put it on our floats because it was too high. To preserve the integrity of the police investigation, they need a new plan. It would have been a lot easier just to take the cab off it, but they wanted to kind of keep it intact, so you try to keep them happy, right? Hey, Jay. Operator Jason Verake has just joined the crew and anything hold it on still and he might have an idea they'll swing it aluminum angular hanglar on the front right they wrap chain that fired up back and cradle everything we're just gonna to tow it. We're going to tow it. They'll try to chain the tractor together so it survives the trip. But the damage is extensive. You can't tow that home, man. The cab is right off the chassis. The engine is hanging loose in it. The transmission is gone out of it. I'm afraid. Yeah, there's a rice transmission is gone out of it. I was afraid. Yeah, there's a rice shafts ripped out of it, too. The boys think they can do it. Let's do it. See what happens. Got to give a shake. With a rigging in place. There we go. It's time to see if the chains will hold. I thought we were going to lose the engines and all, but the guy did the proper ring on it and nothing foul. I can get hooked up to the trailer, and then we can make our way back to town. We're going into, I guess around a 40-hour marathon here, so it's good enough. We feel good to get home tonight. An impossible job and impossibly long stretch of work is finally behind them. That's it. It's going to be a nice night to go home and relax. Who knows how long you're going to be there for, but we're going to go home. All is real, sir. All right, back the north. Sunshine and dry roads again. The next day, the last of the storm has passed through Sarnia. Perfect, but better than it was. At the preferred towing yard, a visitor is rolling in. Welcome to Sarnia. Hey, Andrew. On the ways from home. Yeah. How you doing, buddy? Good, you. Welcome. Herb's towing co-owner, Andrew Vink, is visiting his old family friends, Gary and Colin. So I was just down there on personal business, picking up a snowmobile trailer, and being so close to Garrett, just thought I'd pop in and say hi. So we got a job going on. Do you want to go? Seriously? Yeah. Are we bringing the new tater? Yeah. Play with some new toys. That's awesome. All right, you guys have fun. Sounds good. These two guys are both sons of owners, both in the same position. She's a beast. She's beautiful. So it's really neat to see these two go out and do a recovery together. It won't be a big job. Oh yeah, a bit more and she was going over. Yeah, it's pretty lucky. All right. But three other Yeah, it's pretty lucky. All right. But three other companies turned it down over concerns of flipping the car. We'll try to bring this side up first and see if it wants to level out for us. His car is undamaged in current position, and he wants to keep it that way. So Colin wants to lift rather than pull. The new rotator is ideal for the job this truck you can tell it's a marble of engineering yeah I got admit I got a got a little of truck envy got it now and Andrew is the ideal example for Colin's own career I'll be your eyes on this side? Yeah. Looking good. There we go. I grew up going to the tow shows and meeting Andrew and Herb, so... Your ass and it's completely clear off the ground. Okay. You know, we always have this kind of friendly competition. Oh, yeah, it's good, Colin. Perfect. Beautiful. I can relate our business to theirs. They're going through pretty much the same phases. Look that. We all have the same business model. We always want to raise the bar in the industry. Nice. Nice job. I think I'll have to make a trip down to Herbstowing and do a wreck with Andrews sometimes, see how they do it up on the east end of the highway. Thanks for coming along. Candy day of the week. Getting pretty bad out here. Just those slow and make sure your lights are on. As the sun sets on the eastern end of the 401, the storms that battered the southwest are moving in. There's high winds, lowing snow. As the weather gets worse, Andrew's father, Herb, is heading to join his son's crew just off of Highway 417. Andrew is off for the weekend, so I'm stepping in. At the same time, it gives me a good picture of what goes on. It looks like a mass. He came out of the exit and turned a little too sharp, and the trailer fell into the ditch. We've got a load of specialized soil and some fertilizer. That's 46,000 pounds. It's got no strength on the side's oil. It's going to be offered to lift. Get a little nippy. As rotator-up, Bill Fell joins the crew. Heavy gusts are hitting hard. Temperatures dropping, eh? The wind goes right through you. It felt like minus 30 with the wind. It made it the coldest night of the winter. Okay, Bill, we're going to take the small rotator, unhook the tractor. Yep. We're going to slide it back, and then we're going to operate it. Cibu? Cibu. With cold like that, you want to do it as fast as you can. Okay, Steph, yeah. Put a rim slling on this one and a rimsling on the front line. Please and thank you. What's Zach? Just after 6 p.m., junior operator Zach Thompson arrives on scene. Better late than never. Well, I was on the way back from another tow job. The closer I got to where everyone was working, I realized, wow, the weather's deteriorating pretty bad out here. Okay, Zach, you're going to go to there, keep the front end from going towards my truck. Herb stepping in to lead the crew tonight is a prime opportunity for the 22-year-old rookie. Put your clevis there, and then there's no way out of time. Every time he's on a scene, it's more stressful, but you know that you can prove yourself to him and become a better operator with him around. Passing them, huh? You gotta go slower. I can't, like I have... Yeah, stop. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Earlier this winter, when Herb supervised Zach... Whoa. Let me get on the control for a minute. The boss's patience gave out. You don't want to do something and show them that you're not capable of what you're doing. What's like that? Zach and Bill's first task, disconnecting tractor from trailer. That wind is, uh, who-hoo, it's a kick-out. Weather is a little cratrous. Ooh, we. Eyes are sticking together. Face was frozen, you couldn't even open your eyes. Your nose was frozen solid. Okay, Bill, try sliding. I can get you full of that. Before Zach can even start. I can't see my snitch block. He's forced to stop. I've got to take cover here. This is insane. Forget comedians and cars getting coffee. Do you ever cycle for pure pleasure? I didn't do anything for pure pleasure. This is comedians. On bikes. Kissing scones. And what charm would you like about? Oh, I'm against cooked fruit. So get on board. I mean, what is the train, if not just a very fast shed? With life in the slow lane. When people say off grid, is this what they mean? We're literally on a grid. We're on a network of roads. Along for the ride with David O'Dohatee, Sunday on Duke and on TV and Z Plus. It's a bit to think about. You're right. Feels like a big step for us. with David O'Dohate, Sunday on Juk and on TV and Z Plus. There's a bit to think about. You're right. It feels like a big step for us. Well, if we're going to make it work. I want to talk to the right people, get the right advice. Someone who really gets. What's what? And who's who? Someone with a lot of experience. Over a hundred years should do that trick. So what's next? I suppose we could ask around. More rural New Zealanders partner with FMG to move ahead than any other insurer. Ask around about us to find out why. Beetlejuice. Beedlejuice. Go ahead, Barbara Say it. There's one name you should call. Beetlejuice. It's your day. When you want to rest in peace. What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frame people away? But you need to get rid of the living. When you want to rest in peace... What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people away? But you need to get rid of the living. Can you be scary? You like it? Starring Alec Baldwin, Gina Davis, Winona Ryder, and Michael Keaton. And the ghost was the most, babe. Beetlejuice, Saturday of 7 on 2. Oh my God, I can't feel my cheeks. On a back road off of Highway 417. Okay, Zach, just the drag winch a little bit. Okay. Okay, yeah. Zach is fighting the conditions just to stay at his control. We're dealing with wind and snow and it's nighttime. Andrew's not there. Okay, pull another six-inchot. And I'll get more. Okay. Now pull. It's insane. Come on, baby. There we, naggy. They've wrestled the tractor free. They've wrestled the tractor free. They've turned to the upright. But as they turn to the upright, the conditions have taken a heavy toll. Fingers are cold, aren't they? Your hands are very important. You can't have frozen fingers if you're operating on rotator. You cannot. Okay. have taken a heavy toll. Fingers are cold, aren't they? Your hands are very important. You can't have frozen fingers if you're operating on rotator. You cannot. Okay, Zach, wait. On the control. When your gloves are freezing, you really got to pay attention and you almost have to eyeball it, see how much that lever is moving because you don't have the correct feeling in your hands anymore. Okay, Zach, very slow on your... Do I drive? Yeah. Boom in there, Bill, and boom up at the same time. Okay. Okay. As you turn, you'll come down a bit. I'll come down a bit. I came over nice and smooth, man, all textbook. The tractor was quick. Now they're facing the trailer, and 46,000 pounds of soil and peat moss. We can't flip it over with all the weight in it. If we do that, we risk ripping the whole trailer apart. And we don't want that. Want to double it or no? Yeah. The first step, drag it onto the pavement. The topa comes back on the road in one piece. Bill, can you look on the other side and just make sure that that we're not tearing everything apart? It was across a six or an eight-foot ditch, which meant that a major portion of it wasn't supported. Okay, guys, whatever you're ready. Go slow. Yeah, she's dropping, she's dropping. She's dropping. You got another six months ago. Bring her right to me. I mean. Good. Good job, boys. I taught you well. Time to unload this crap. It will take at least three hours to offload. And the dropping temperature is draining the crew. The quicker we could get the job done, the safer it was for everybody, and the cold made it tremendously treachered. Ready? Yeah. All right. Let's do this. This was the most labor-intensive wreck we've had all year, and wouldn't you know what happened on the coldest night of the year? Pretty much a workout done for the weekend. Happy that's over. Good job. Now the upright. Put a strap underneath, ready to roll it back over, and put the strap on the top here too. Okay. There's one strap there and one strap here. Jack's record will work from the front with Bill on the rotator on the back end, rolling the trailer in mid-air and setting it down. Got enough? And by now, they've been working in the minus 30 conditions for six straight hours. There's a lift one side? And then the other side just dropped it. Finding out that we're doing a mid-air roll, it'd be my second one I've ever done. Zach will need to time his move perfectly with Bill, lifting and then rolling, and the wind will make it even tougher. Whenever this trailer is completely up in the air and nothing is touching the ground anymore, it would act like a kite, swinging around. Okay, Zach? Yeah. I want you to do yellow and red, both at the same time, to lift up a bit, and then mostly yellow. Okay. He's falling slowly. Just feather it slower. Mostly yellow. Okay. Keep falling slowly. Just feather it slower. I'm not too sure about this. You ready, Azak? I'm good to go. Okay. Boat yellow and red up, Azak. On a frigid road north of Cornwall. I want you to go both at the same time, Matt, Zach. Up. You can lift on the bottom one, Matt, Bill. Zach is attempting his second ever mid-air roll. That wind is treacherous. And the weather isn't helping. You've got a 53-foot kite out there. Hey, it's not going more once in a while. If the wind did catch it, you'd have to react pretty quick. So hold on Zach for a second. Zach was under quite a bit of pressure. Precision was the name of the game. Bottom one lifted. Zach yellow in. You could actually go red down. You never know what's going to happen. Could swing into one of our trucks, could put extra load on the lines, lines could snap. So we wanted to do this as quickly and as efficiently as possible to get it back onto the ground. It's all on you guys, aye? Okay. Did a beautiful job. As soon as I did a beautiful job, then. As soon as I saw the wheels touch the ground, I let a huge gaspaveiro. I couldn't have been more excited. I would say that it was freaking perfect. I'm impressed. Zach's second winter on the heavy crew has ended with a big win. I'm not in the office on day-to-day base, but he's learning quick. That's a great feeling. He's back on her normal side. Doesn't look so funny no more. It was a proud moment for me. Couldn't have asked for a better one than that. I think we did really good. Yeah. And as Herb spends less time out on the highway, he can breathe a little easier. The heart and soul of any business is your people.
