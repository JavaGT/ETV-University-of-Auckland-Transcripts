Awha, a team to help you, while you're in working, but if you're at that of the on the table, you just, you just, you just, I'm having a I'm wearing my team, strength HQ of my team, in my team, strength edge queue, my friends, my friends, and although it's a harkin'n of the moke-moke, we'll find a team to lead you. I often talk about breaking the bar. When we're starting, I'm starting to see a few people yank again. So we're going to try and reiterate, break the tension of the bar before we're lifting, instead of going straight 0 to 100 straight away. Yeah, there you go. Woo-hoo! Kata'a, I love it. If you see my last name backwards, it spells I love it. The bigger picture for my business, for I love it, is to essentially do things that I actually love. So at the moment, we're covering the physical aspect of Hauwara with my weightlifting. Eventually, we're going to step into the mental health space. I'm helping MƒÅori rangatahi learn how to deal with their emotions. So at the moment I'm doing that through weightlifting. But the bigger picture is to run Wananga, to run kupapa that allow us to teach, that allow us to hold space with men, with women, with rangatahi, where they can be their true authentic selves. And I guess learn about themselves not just through weightlifting but but through kaupapa maha and so last year this this movement started where a group of MƒÅori men came together every Sunday and I was teaching them how to weight lift and from that weight lifting we started diving into the mental health side of things you know and to find that stigma of MƒÅori men on Sunday morning just being hung over. You know, here we were at the gym at 6 in the morning, lifting weights, you know, having a good yarn, having laughs. The hope is that we can make this a bigger movement, you know, that they can help many MƒÅori men across the Mutu, you know, and not even just our men, our woman as well, and ultimately our rangatahe. So, we're just in the beginning phases now, I feel this is something we need, and a way of me giving back to my people. Come. Come. Thank you. Thank you.
