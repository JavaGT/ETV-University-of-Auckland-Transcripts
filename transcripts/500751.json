I'm, it is Rapa, Wednesday, April the 20th. Namahe, Otea-Aa, K, Dan, 10a, today on RNZ National. Russia's new all-out assault on eastern Ukraine is escalating, with thousands more troops descending on the region. Property developers are cutting their prices by tens of thousands of dollars in order to hold onto buyers. Also, Immigration New Zealand has lost 20% of its workforce, but demand for visas is growing. And $12,000 worth of fines are dished out each day on a new market bus lane. Her area of the weather today finds the lower half of the North Islands, but rain or showers elsewhere. RNZ News at 6 o'clock. Good morning. I'm Anna Thomas. Russia has launched hundreds of missiles as Russia and Ukrainian forces fight across a 500-kilometer front in the east of the country. Ukraine's governor of Luhansk says Russian forces were attacking the region on all sides. Dan Johnson of the BBC reports from Ukraine. The Russian Defence Ministry said more than 1,200 targets were hit across the country last night by missiles and artillery, as it began what the Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described as another stage and an important moment in its military operation. He told an Indian news channel Russia would not use nuclear weapons. Ukraine says Kremlina, a town in the Luhansk region, has been lost, but that its forces have made successful counterattacks south of Harkiv. Russian-backed fighters are reportedly trying to storm the Azov-style steelworks in Mariupol. The plant is the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the port city. Meanwhile, military analysts say Ukrainian forces are making some successful counter-attack south of Kharkiv. Property developers are cutting their asking price by tens of thousands of dollars as the housing market continues to cool. Developers need to keep the cash coming in with finance from banks now harder to come by. Some smaller firms are already coming unstuck and having to sell off half-finished developments to bigger companies. The banks are also asking them to write in longer sunset clauses so buyers can't walk away. The National Party says revelations managed isolation and quarantine could have ended sooner, show the government was not following public health advice. Top health officials agreed MIQ was no longer justified on public health grounds last November, but it continued until March. Nationals COVID-19 response spokesperson Chris Bishop says it was obvious MIQ wasn't necessary last year, given rising community cases with only a few at the border. That's why public health officials said the risk was not actually at the border anymore, it was more in the community and therefore MIQ wasn't justified. So I think people will find it pretty frustrating that MIQ could have ended sooner and thousands of New Zealanders could have come home. Chris Bishop says the MIQ revelations demonstrate the need for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the government's response to COVID-19. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologised to Parliament after he was fined by police for breaking lockdown rules. But he insisted he did not know a birthday gathering at the height of the pandemic was in breach of the rules he had set. Mr Johnson said the public had the right to expect higher standards. Opponents have called for Mr Johnson to resign, accusing him of misleading Parliament after he told him peace last year that all rules were followed in Downing Street during the pandemic. Jacinda Ardern has used her visit to Singapore to make a plug. New Zealand is reopening, please come visit. The Prime Minister delivered the message to Singaporean business people at a glitzy gala dinner last night. Our deputy political editor Craig McCannock was there. The dinner was hosted at the landmark Gardens by the Bay, with locals treated to New Zealand's salmon, beef and wine. Ms Ardun appealed to the guests to come visit, drawing on the country's hospitality and wide-open landscapes. She suggested they may at first find New Zealanders overly enthusiastic for their return. The borders reopened to visa-waiver countries from May 2nd. Ms Arduin will visit Singapore's port today, one of the busiest in the world, before travelling on to Japan. Batch bookings over Easter were higher than they've been in years. Mostly fine and warm weather as well as looser COVID settings meant New Zealanders traveled widely for the four-day weekend. One website that hires out holiday homes, batch care, was 97% booked out nationwide. Sainar Azark, the head of marketing, says they list about 2,000 holiday homes and over the weekend, just 80 of those were not booked. She says it was the busiest weekend for them since Queen's birthday 2020, shortly after the first COVID lockdown lifted. Another website, Bookabatch, says they were similarly busy. A bus lane in Auckland's new market generated $4.3 million in fines during 2021. Almost 29,000 vehicles were caught travelling more than 50 metres in the lane. Auckland Transport denies the 160 metre stretch of Khyber Pass Road as a revenue gatherer. It says the warning signs on the lane meet legal requirements and sometimes it takes a fine to change motorists' behaviour. To sport now and British cycling says its safeguarding team had tried to contact Sir Bradley Wiggins after the five times Olympic champion alleged he had been sexually groomed by a coach when he was 13. 41-year-old Wiggins made the claims in an interviewed with Men's Health UK magazine and said the abuse had an impact on him as an adult. He did not name the coach. The Netherlands men's cricket coach Ryan Campbell is an intensive care in a hospital in the UK after suffering a heart attack. The 50-year-old Australian led this side on their recent tour of New Zealand. Forwards, Matt Lodge and Jazz Tavanga are back in the Warriors squad for the traditional Anzac Day contest against the storm in Melbourne on Monday. Lodge returns from injury while Tevanga has been named on the extended bench after serving a two-match suspension for dangerous contact. And Manchester United Ford, Cristiano Ronaldo, will not play against Liverpool in the Premier League this morning following the death of his newborn son yesterday. And that's the news. The odds were enormous against us. We had a dog fight over the French coast. I don't know what I was hit by. I certainly didn't see anybody. The aircraft was on fire. And I flew the whole war as a Wellington reargimmer. So the old Wellington did me proud, you know, twice I walked out of it.

Overnight, Russian forces pushed further into the besieged country's industrial heartland, which comprises the two big regions of Lujansk and Donetsk. This is the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shaigu, speaking in a military briefing. The Russian army is fulfilling the task set by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief in the course of a special military operation. We are gradually implementing our plan to liberate the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics and taking measures to restore peaceful life. Standing before them are some of Ukraine's best-trained troops, already posted in the East, because of the eight-year war with Russian-backed separatist. Russia has claimed control of Kramina, an eastern town of 18,000 people, but the governor of the Le Hansk region's administration, Sergei, said Ukrainian forces were now regrouping. Our defenders had to retreat because they were holding up the defence for two months and the enemy was shelling every metre of our defence line and everyone understood very clearly that there was nothing to hold on to there. There was no shelter and our men were dying and not being able to hit the enemy. So they moved away. They settled new positions and will carry on fighting the Russian army, but in a more effective way. Well, seven people were killed by shelling in and around the eastern city of Kharkiv overnight. Well, a further 30 were wounded, according to local officials. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale has the latest. We've certainly seen an intensification of shelling by Russian artillery right across that essentially 300-mile area of the Dombas region, the provinces of Le Hansk and Dernetsk, as you say. And what we've seen is the Russians doing probing attacks. They are looking for weaknesses in Ukraine's defenses. They're also trying to weaken the Ukrainian forces' defenses and their resolve, and the population's resolve too. They are bombarding towns and cities right across the region from the north down to the south, and they clearly are stepping up their military operations. I think there's a different view between what the Pentagon thinks is going on. They think this is what they call shaping operations. In other words, the prelude to a major offensive, finding that weakness. And also, we've heard from President Zeletsky, who says, who believes that this offensive is already underway. But clearly, if it's not underway, it is imminent. We know that the Russian forces have brought in extra troops. They now have 76 battalion tactical groups. There are about 800, 900 men in each of those tactical groups. Eleven have been brought in over the last few days, the Pentagon says. That's about half the total force that Russia began within the invasion. Some of those units are battered and bruised, but they are different now because they know that they will meet resistance from a Ukraine that they're not going to be welcome with open arms. And they're now under a unified command and they're fighting on fewer fronts. So they are a bigger threat in that region. Well, it's estimated that Russia's invasion has damaged or destroyed up to 30% of Ukraine's infrastructure at a cost of about $150 billion. It's 11 minutes past six. Well, this morning, US President Joe Biden came off a 90-minute video call with several other leaders and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to consider a response to Russia's escalation. Our correspondent in Washington, D.C. is Simon. Good morning, Simon. Morning, Corinne. Okay, looking at the readout of this, some more pledges of aid. This comes, of course, ahead of the big push. So I guess some sort of recommitments by the US. Yeah, absolutely. And just within the last few minutes, President Biden has arrived in New Hampshire, where he's going to be making some appearances today to promote his domestic legislation, and asked by reporters if he plans to send more artillery to Ukraine, he stopped and said, yes. So that is the deliverable that we know about so far arising from that virtual meeting that President Biden had with partners and allies, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Boris Johnson in the UK, Olaf Schultz in Germany, the Americans very keen to try and persuade the German Chancellor to do more than he's done so far to assist Ukraine. White House officials had also suggested that this conversation was going to discuss additional sanctions that could be levied against Russia and also really to engage in a continuing discussion framed by, first of all, that news from 24 hours ago that the Kremlin says it's beginning this fresh phase of its military onslaught targeting the eastern region of Donbass, but also more broadly on the fact that it is becoming apparent that this is going to be a grinding conflict that goes on potentially for a very long period of time. Right, so other countries involved there, are they making pledges as well? I mean, or is this all falling on the US? Well, we did see some pledges of additional weaponry earlier today from some countries in Europe, including the UK and the Netherlands. Whether that is the full commitment that was agreed during the course of these talks today. We don't know yet. There will be more information coming out from the White House, certainly later in the day, about precisely how that conversation played out. But President Biden has been absolutely clear that he wants to see an ongoing commitment to Ukraine, not just from the United States, but from all members of NATO and the country's European allies, because the bedrock centerpiece, if you like, of his response to Ukraine is to say that Vladimir Putin completely miscalculated, not just in terms of the ferocity of the Ukrainian resistance that Russian soldiers would encounter, but also miscalculated because he didn't understand the strength of European and allied unity. Now, you know, as I was saying, with regard to Germany, in fact, the White House perhaps overplays the nature of that quote-unquote unity. And that's one of the reasons why the President wanted this conversation today in a bid to try and keep everyone on the same page. The longer this goes on with Europe reliant on Russia for 40% of its energy supplies, the more the Kremlin will be aware that it has the capacity to drive a wedge between the United States and some of its allies on the other side of the Atlantic. Finally, Simon, where are things at politically in the US on the Ukraine crisis now? The Ukraine war, it has been going on for quite a while now. I guess the initial shock and horror may have worn off a little bit with some of the US public. Where is it at in terms of Biden's approach and any further escalation from the US? Well, the ground is shifting beneath the White House feet. I mean, as far as polling is concerned, 75% of Americans told pollsters last week they believe that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, but still, most Americans said they disapproved of President Biden's handling of the crisis. I mean, that goes hand in hand with polling that continues to show his approval ratings more broadly continuing to crash. But there is pressure on him now from some senior Democrats on Capitol Hill, including Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a man who was once tipped as Joe Biden's possible Secretary of State when the administration was being put together. Chris Coons said over the weekend that he now believes the situation is so grave and the conflict likely to be so protracted that he thinks Joe Biden should be putting American soldiers into Ukraine to support Ukraine. The White House said that even though the president and Senator Coons are very good friends and political soulmates, they disagree with the senator. But that gives you an indication that the longer this goes on, the more anxious some members of Congress are about how all of these pictures of civilian slaughter at the hands of the Russians in Ukraine are playing out in the United States just a matter of months before absolutely crucial midterm elections. Simon Max, thank you as always our Washington, D.C. correspondent. It is 16 minutes past six. Well, there's been some skepticism about the official figures from China on the numbers of COVID-19 related deaths in Shanghai. Only 10 people are reported to have died since the city went into lockdown in late March. From 2020 until this week, the city of 25 million people had reported zero coronavirus deaths. The country's financial hub is due to enter another round of mass testing, extending the strict lockdown into a fourth week for most residents. The BBC's Kerry Allen has more. What's significant about this is that there have been so few deaths in the last year in China. I think it's been 12 in the last year, and that's including the 10 that have been reported over the last couple of days. So, yeah, these deaths that have been recorded in Shanghai, the majority of them are being recorded as over the age of 75 with underlying health conditions. And media have been saying that the majority of these were not vaccinated. But what's surprising about this is that China has had a very strong vaccination drive. I mean, it was one of the first countries that really, really pushed forward and promoted vaccination. It's got a huge production hub, so it's able to vaccinate as many people as possible. So that's led to some scrutiny over whether it's the effectiveness of vaccines, because so many people reportedly had at least two, three. I mean, the statistics are over three billion vaccines have been administered in the country and China's got a population of 1.4 billion. So that's the equivalent of over a billion people having had three jabs. Well, some social media posts speculating that the number of COVID-19 deaths may be higher have been making their way through. However, social media platforms are incredibly restricted in China and state media drowns out any criticism of the government. Chinese officials have also vowed that all positive COVID cases and close contacts will enter government quarantine facilities. CNN's David Culver explains the latest developments from Shanghai. Now, the comments come as the community or societal spread of the virus is expected to end soon. That does not mean this is all over. In fact, it could be far from over. Instead, it means they aim for cases to only be detected inside the isolation facilities. As the lockdown for millions in China's financial hub continues, videos online show senior citizens in Shanghai, some in their 90s, being transferred to government-designated quarantine centers. One patient in a warehouse-turned quarantine center told CNN that he saw a group of elderly patients, some in wheelchairs, being transported from a nursing home after they tested positive. Well, public outrage over food supply shortages have continued, with videos emerging online of fresh boxes of vegetables being thrown in the rubbish. Now the government says the vegetables rotted during transportation and the donor recalled them. But the videos show workers dumping hundreds of boxes of vegetables into garbage cans and in one video, you can actually hear a worker say, all of them are still fresh and now they're dumped. It's such a pity. One time getting food here, along with some of the medical care that folks need, it's been a real challenge. Many Shanghai residents have been experiencing food shortages and difficulties buying food during the weeks of lockdown. Social media videos and posts also show donations couldn't reach people's neighborhoods due to logistical obstacles. That is CNN's David Culver there at 20 minutes past six. A study has found that being seriously overweight substantially increases a woman's risk of developing womb cancer. Researchers analysed genetic samples from more than 120,000 women from seven countries, including Australia, the UK and the US. Here is the BBC's Michelle Roberts. This study was looking at lifelong obesity or being overweight. We know that we use a measure called BMI, but it's body mass index. It looks at how heavy you are for your height. And a healthy range is sort of up to 25, 18 to 25 in this BMI calculation. Now, if women were overweight or obese and that continued through lifetime, that's when their risk appeared to increase of this wound cancer. Now, there are other factors involved. There were genetic elements, too, they think, and hormones that might be behind some of this risk. And we know that being overweight increases the risk of other cancers too. What the researchers are trying to discover now is, are there things that can be done? Obviously, healthy lifestyle, etc. can help lower that risk again. But they think the hormonal element is really interesting too, because it's linked to estrogen, they think, and also sort of insulin levels. So maybe there are ways of treating it as well with certain medications. I mean, we already know for breast cancer, there are certain anti-estrogen drugs that can help. So that's the avenue they're now sort of trying to look along in terms of therapies. That is the BBC's Michelle Roberts there. Around 400 to 500 New Zealanders are diagnosed with worm or uterus cancer each year. It is now 22 minutes past six. You're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. And taking a quick look at what's happening around the world this morning. On the Guardian, of course, the France election that runoff is approaching. President Macron and allies are warning that victory is not certain. This is as his poll lead grows over Marine Le Pen. The centrist backers say voters still need convincing that his policies are best for them ahead of that presidential runoff. Also more information coming out regarding Cristiano Ronaldo. He's on compassionate leave now and will miss the game game at Liverpool that Manchester and United are going to be playing. This is, as the club says, family more important than anything. This is after Cristiano Ronaldo and his wife announced that his son, one of twins, had died during childbirth. Quick look across the Tasman. One story that caught my eye in the Sydney Morning Herald, New South Wales, to end COVID-19 household isolation rules and Victoria as well, in fact, they will end the requirements for household contacts of COVID-positive people by this weekend, as both states pass the peak of the Omicron wave, the removal of the last major remaining pandemic restrictions means people who live with positive coronavirus cases will no longer need to isolate at home for seven days. Right at 23 minutes past six, Charles Beckford, in with the business update. Gere to you, Corrin. Let's have a look at the markets. First of all, Wall Street, it's higher. Investors seem to be concentrating on strong company earnings rather than the prospect of higher interest rates to combat inflation. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 1.1% up. The S&P 500 is 1.2% higher, and the NASDAQ is 1.5% up. Our top 50 index, however, return to losing ways, down 56 points, about half a percent, just touching 11,830 yesterday. A New Zealand dollar seems to be a little be calmed at 67.3 US cents, 91.2 Australian, obviously investors biding their time ahead of tomorrow's inflation numbers. In our main bulletin, we'll also be looking at panel beaters who are renewing their complaints about an insurance company's in-house repair business. They suggest consumers may be the losers. Locally made medicinal cannabis products finally hit chemist shop shelves, but it's been a long and winding road. And the state of mind of some of the best and brightest entrepreneurs, seems they're feeling the mental and financial pinch, much like the rest of us. Hoping you that, and the latest from the markets, just after 10 to 7. Kjura, thank you very much, Charles Beckford, with your business update, 25 minutes past 6. Konga Kornahuro, our main stories on Morning Report today. A reminder of the headlines. And all-out Russian assault on the east of Ukraine is escalating. Some returnees are asking for compensation after it was revealed thousands could have skipped MIQ if health advice had been followed. And higher mortgage rates and lower demand are beginning to bite property developers. Now at 25 minutes past 6 on to the rural news, Susan Murray is in with us from Kirikarroa this morning. Kiyura, Susan. Good morning, Susie. And our live animal exporters, saying their views being ignored by the government. The primary production select committee has just concluded its inquiry into live animal exports by sea. Now, you may recall that last year following a review of the practice, the government announced that it would ban live exports by sea. Now, you may recall that last year following a review of the practice, the government announced that it would ban live exports by sea with a two-year phase-out period. The Animal Welfare Amendment Bill was introduced, and it's been going through the Select Committee process and there were over 600 submissions considered. The votes were tied at the committee and it was unable to agree on whether the bill should be passed. Livestock exports New Zealand chairman Mark Willis says the government will likely push ahead with the band because it holds a majority. We put forward what we call the gold standard for the export of livestock by sea. That standard looked at the entire process from the preparation of livestock through to the actual sea journey itself and how we could ensure the highest standards of animal welfare were maintained throughout that journey. But even further than that, we were looking at working with our customers in market and providing assurances back to New Zealand that the animals were going to be looked after by standards that were at least the equivalent of New Zealand welfare standards for the entirety of their life. So it was a comprehensive way of being able to address the concerns. Mark Willis says the industry's asked to meet with the Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor, but that invite was declined. The Animal Welfare Amendment Bill will now go through its second reading and then go to the whole house. Now, MPI looking for beekeepers to take part in a surveillance project. That's right. They're on the lookout for small hive beetle, and it can cause huge damage to hives that spoils honey and affects yields. Now, it's not in the country yet, but biosecurity New Zealand is looking for 100 beekeepers to take place in a larger surveillance program. And senior scientist Richard Hall says the beetle could arrive as a hidden stowaway on a range of goods. They first emerged from sub-Saharan Africa and they've spread to many other countries around the world. The closest country we know of that has them is Australia. The larvae when they're in the hive cause a lot of damage to the hive. So they'll tunnel through honeycomb. They'll destroy the brood, the young bees, the larvae, that they'll destroy pollen. And they actually can destroy the honey crops and beehives as well. They leave a yeast behind that can ferment and spoil the honey crops. So there are a special management techniques that other countries have had to take to deal with it when it has arrived in their country. If it did arrive here, could we eradicate it? From what we know of other countries, they've not been able to eradicate it. So early detection is going to be critical. Richard Hall says beekeepers are keenly aware of the risks that this pest does pose to the industry. Indeed. And Susan, you've got the latest from the global dairy trade auction. Yeah, the prices have fallen for a third consecutive auction, but they do remain at near record levels. The average price at the fortnightly auction fell 3.6% to 4,885 US a ton, and that's after falling 1% in the previous auction. The price for whole milk powder, that's the one that strongly influences the payouts for local farmers it was down 4.4% to $4,207 US dollars a ton. There was 3% more product on offer and prices for all products dropped. Dairy farmers, however, are still in line for a record payout this season. And Susie, that's our rural news for this morning, but we'll have another update in the Midday Report Hour. Thank you very much, Susan Murray, there with Gawarero, Taifanoa at half-past six on RNZ National. You're listening to Morning Report, with Corundan and Susie Ferguson, and Tuare, the weather for today, fine for the lower half of the North Island, rain or showers elsewhere, and temperatures in the main centres, 24 degrees for Auckland and Hamilton today, Tauranga 22, 21 for Wellington, 23, expected for Christchurch and Dunedin 20 degrees, the warmest place at the moment. Again, it is Kaitaya on 20.2. Coldest place, again, is Mosquil on 3.8. Coming up before 7 on Morning Report, Faiaki now, we speak to Nationals COVID-19 response spokesperson Chris Bishop about the call for compensation for some MIQ returnees. Māori leader Tamak Solomon joins us after being named as the new chair of the Orangatamariqi Ministerial Advisory Board. And Irish travellers say racism is causing a suicide crisis. Only 3% of us live past the age of 65 years of age. Travelers have never seen a national outcry. Now the news with Nicola Wright. Anna Thomas, actually. Russia has launched its long-awaited all-out assault on East Ukraine and so far captured the small city of Kremlin in Lujansk region. Ukraine, however, says it has successfully counterattacked south of the country's second-larger city of Kharkiv. Heavy clashes are reported along a 500-kilometer front, with Russia saying it has struck at 1,200 targets overnight with missiles and artillery. Russian special forces are meanwhile attempting to finally overcome defenders in a giant steelworks in the city of Mariupol. Its defense ministry said it had opened a corridor for Ukrainian forces who wanted to surrender and 120 civilians had escaped. The National Party says thousands more New Zealanders could have freely traveled home sooner if the government had followed public health advice. It's been revealed top health officials agreed. MIQ was no longer justified on public health grounds last November, but it kept running until March. National's COVID-19 response spokesperson Chris Bishop says it was obvious MIQ wasn't necessary last year, given rising community cases with only a handful at the border. Mr Bishop says the revelations confirm the need for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the government's response to COVID-19. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given what he termed a whole-hearted apology to Parliament after he was fined for breaking COVID-19 lockdown laws. As soon as I received the notice, I acknowledge the hurt and the anger. And I said that people had a right to expect better of their Prime Minister. He repeated that it did not occur to him that the birthday party he attended in Downing Street in 2020 was a breach of the rules. The opposition leader Labour's Kier-Stama says the statement was a joke. A cooling property market is squeezing some developers who are cutting their asking price by tens of thousands of dollars. Developers need to keep the cash coming in, with finance from banks now harder to come by. Some smaller firms are already coming unstuck and having to sell off half-finished developments to bigger companies. The banks are also asking them to write in longer sunset clauses, so buyers can't walk away. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardenne has used a speech in Singapore to encourage all countries to sign a United Nations Treaty outlawing nuclear weapons. The treaty has been ratified by more than 50 countries, but not Singapore. Speaking at a gala dinner last night, Ms. Arden told guests that disputes must be solved through dialogue rather than coercion as seen in Russia's invasion in Ukraine. Ms. Ardern described nuclear weapons as a dark cloud hanging over us. Speed cameras along a 160 metre length of bus lane in Auckland's new market generated $4.3 million in fines during 2021. That's an average of $12,000 worth of fines per day. The Automobile Association's Martin Glynn thinks the high level of fines indicates an issue with the lane. Rarely Auckland Transport should be measuring success on how they can increase in compliance, get the infringement rate down and bring the public with them. Otherwise, people will just see this revenue gathering. Auckland Transport denies the lane as intended as a revenue gatherer and says it will consider ideas for improvement from the community. And New Zealand has travelled widely around the country over Easter with bookings at holiday homes the highest in years. The fine weather over the public holiday gave many of the first decent chance to get away in some time. Book a batch website to rent holiday homes said more bookings than any other time since Easter 2019. Spokesperson Simone Scobber says in some popular holiday spots almost every batch was full. And that's the news. Today after 1pm on afternoons with me Wallace Chapin in for Jesse Mulligan will be speaking to former Labor Secretary under President Clinton Robert Reich. He describes the possible purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk as disastrous in a move that won't help free speech flourish. And comedian Tim Batton as well depict some of his favorite things for bookmarks, all that from 1pm on RNZ National. And now the MetService regional forecast. First, the situation north-the-east develop across Alteoroa today is a series of fronts approach the South Island from the south-west. So looking at the regional forecasts until midnight tonight, Northland, Auckland and Coromandel Peninsula, cloudy showers, some possibly heavy in Northland and Coromandel Peninsula this morning, then easing this evening, northeasterly's fresh and exposed places. Waikato, Bay of Plenty Rotorua, and Gisbon, often cloudy with a few showers, but occasional drizzle about the Bay of Plenty, northeasterly's fresh and exposed places this afternoon. Waitomo, Taumaranui, Taranaki, Tahoe and Manoa too. Also, Horofenoa, Kapiti Coast and Wellington, cloudy periods, isolated showers mainly about Mount Taranaki with northerlies. Hawks Bay in Wairdapa, including the Tararar District, cloudy at times, northeasterlies, Nelson, Bulla and Westland in Fjordland, showers turning to rain this morning with some heavy falls, possible thunderstorms in the west this evening, northern east developing this morning, becoming strong and exposed places. Malbara, Canterbury, Otago and Southland. Cloudy periods with isolated morning showers in areas of low cloud or fog about the east coast, scattered rain developing in inland Malbara and most of Otago and Southland. Cloudy periods with isolated morning showers and areas of low cloud or fog about the east coast, scattered rain developing in inland Malbara and most of Otago and Southland this morning with northeasterlies. Chatham Islands, cloudy periods with a possible morning shower north-alise and the outlook for all of New Zealand until midnight tomorrow, showers or rain developing for most with heavy falls possible in the west and north of both islands and for the Chatham's cloudy periods in strong north of east. It is 23 minutes to 7. Thank you Anna. Nice to have you with us this week. Sorry for mixing up your name. Oh good. Oh, gosh. Very good. Now it's 24 minutes past 7. That is time to talk sport with Barry Guy. Good morning, Barry. Morning. A hundred days until the Commonwealth Games. I have to be honest, I forgot they were on. That's right. We've just had the Olympics, it seems, and the Commonwealth Games here, they're... Where are they? Birmingham in England, if people out there didn't really know where it is. It's, end of July, it starts. And it has come around a little bit underneath the radar, I think because of everything else that's been going on, and also because of COVID and the likes, there haven't been a lot of sports that have been taking part, all that qualification. We have just the weightlifting team and the Paraboles team. They're the only ones that have been named so far. So will it be a big contingent? No. Well, it'll be less than in recent games just because they're trying to pull back on the cost of holding the games and the number of people and we remember, it was just a few weeks ago that the state of Victoria in Australia was confirmed for the next Commonwealth Games. Normally they do that six years out, but because it seems there's a lack of interest in hosting it just because of the cost and those sorts of things. They've pulled back. 72 nations, 4,500 athletes, 20 sports. They reckon it's going to cost Birmingham around $15 billion, which is the most expensive event in Britain since 2012. New Zealand goes there, may have about 230 athlete, but half of those will be sport, team team sport athletes, because this time there's women's cricket, three-by-three basketball, hockey netball, rugby sevens, half of our team will be there. For some sports like swimming and athletics, it's not the pinnacle, is it? I mean, obviously the Olympics is the pinnacle, but for something like Lorne Bowls, it's very important. And a lot of those Commonwealth sort of games, squash, the likes, they don't get into the Olympics either. We won two gold medals, four medals in squash. We have the Joel King won Manchester yesterday. Paul Cole's the world number one. So this is big for them. Sevens, of course. I think we won both sevens and Gold Coast, and they'll be defending titles there also. So, yes, just because of the numbers, the cutting back of the numbers, I understand that athletics are only going to have 15 at the most. They're limited. You can't have any more. This is the number that we're allowed to take to Birmingham. So athletics has been given this number of athletes to take. Just finally, COVID, are we likely to see any restrictions or will it be a bit more relaxed maybe than the Olympics, say, for the protocols? I think it will be a bit more relaxed, but, you know, you hear Boris and the Brits, they pretty much do anything they want, don't they? So maybe the athletes will be a bit more circumspect, hopefully, and we'll go through with no problems whatsoever. Yes, indeed. Barry Guy, thank you very much for that. Your sports chat this morning, 21 minutes to seven. You're listening to Morning Report, and as we are reporting this morning, a man who tried and failed six times to get a spot in MIQ wants compensation. A Ministry of Health document shows that in November last year, top officials advised that MIQ was no longer needed, but the system wasn't abandoned until almost four months later. With us now, the National Party's COVID-19 response spokesperson, Chris Bishop. Kiora, good morning. Kiora, good morning. So, your reaction here, was this disproportionate overreach by the government? I think you've got to remember the circumstances at the time. We were back in November. There were a lot of cases of Delta in the New Zealand community and very few coming through the border. He had a lot of people coming from overseas who were vaccinated and the number of people actually turning up with COVID at the border was very few. And so that's the circumstances with which Dr McElnay and Dr. Blunfield basically said, M.I.Q couldn't be justified anymore because the risk wasn't at the border, the risk was in the community and therefore we needed to move to a self-isolation model. The government didn't do that, and it's really forward to them to explain as to why that was, but I think obviously there'll be enormous frustration from a lot of people out there who could have come home, and we could have had more people going through the system, and of course all those people who have been separated from their loved ones and missed in general and all of the sort of human hardship stories that you've had on the program and that MPs have been inundated with over the last couple of years. Those people will be very frustrated. Indeed. The government does say this was not final advice and that there was a significant part of it which was about getting the vaccination rate up higher. Is that reasonable? Look, I think the government will always have a range of different things they'll say. You've got to remember, the vaccination rate by mid-November last year were very good. They were 80% plus in most regionsmber last year were very good. They were 80% plus, you know, in most regions. So they were really good. And obviously we didn't have the booster program, hadn't started rolling out then. You know, again, things have moved recently quickly in the last few months. But, you know, this was Dr. McElnay and Dr. Bloomfield basically saying that legally they didn't think that there could be any justification for MIQ anymore at that point. And of course, there were other health experts saying that at the same time as well. There was a blog post or a paper done by Dr Lucy Barnard and a range of authors saying similar things at the time, but actually the risk wasn't at the border anymore for brushstrokes. The risk was in the community. But clearly there were also others, other experts who were saying no, we need to be more cautious. The government did seek further advice, not involved in this decision, but Michael Baker is one of the high-profile epidemiologists who was urging caution. So was it responsible of the government to seek further advice and to keep MIQ open? Yeah, look, I suppose you can always look back with hindsight, but I suppose what I would say is that at the time there was enormous pressure through the MIQ system and it looks like in retrospect we could have had a few more people through the system by moving to self-isolation earlier than we actually did. And I can totally understand the perspective of people who are stuck offshore who were double-vaccinated and wanted to come home. And they looked at New Zealand and said, well, hang on a minute, I'm double-vaccinated, I don't have COVID. I'm not the risk here, and I'm a New Zealand citizen, I want to come home. I'm not the risk here. The risk is actually with people in other parts of New Zealand who do have COVID. I'm not the risk here, and I'm a New Zealand citizen and I want to come home, I'm not the risk here. The risk is actually with people in other parts of New Zealand who do have COVID. And so there was a range of really bizarre circumstances where you had more people actually with COVID in taking up the MIQ facilities from the New Zealand community versus people who were New Zealand citizens offshore who were double vaccinated who didn't have COVID. And so, of course, those people rightly feel very frustrated by that. Just briefly, considering this document has now come to light, does that mean that keeping MIQ open amounted to a breach of the Bill of Rights? Well, look, the court, there's a court cases that are taken by the grounded Kiwis that you've reported on, which will, I think, rule on that. That judgment is due sometime recently shortly. It's going to be very interesting. I think the key point is that the justification for MIQ changed over time as the public health circumstances changed. So clearly, you know, when it was put in place back in April, May 2020, it was clearly justified. The question of whether or not it was justified by November 2021 is an open question. What you've got here is for the first time the public health advice from that period saying that it wasn't justified at that point. And may I just say in passing, it's quite outrageous that it's taken, you know, in a complaint to the Ombudsman for that advice to be made public. The idea that it was free and frank and that we should have seen it was pretty bad. Should people who stayed in MIQ over this period be refunded? Look, I think that's going to be impossible to do. Why? Because it would just be impossible to do but why? Well, it's just be impossible to work out the precise circumstances and the precise times with which it was justified or wasn't But I mean if MIQ wasn't justified then is it not just everyone from that day forth? Yeah, well working out precisely when that was, I think, is going to be tricky. So, look, if it's possible to do that, then, yep, let's do it. But I think there'll be logistical, practical difficulties with it. I have to say, I'm a little bit confused because I thought that, especially considering how much you talked about MIQQ that you would be angrier about this. Oh look there are many people angry about it and this is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with as an MP in the last my seven years as an MP the MIQ cases the human hardship and the tragedy that has come about because of it. I am hugely frustrated for many New Zealanders out there. So, yeah, MIQ is the hardest thing I think many MPs we've had to deal with. I know it's been tough for the Minister of COVID, and it's been tough for those who have dealt with the system as well. I appreciate your time this morning. Chris Bishop there. National's COVID-19 response spokesperson at 14 to 7. Maori leader, Tarmak Solomon, is the new chair of the Oranga Tamariki Ministerial Advisory Board. In the role, Tamak will help monitor the introduction of changes. He helped put forward. He says strengthening child protection measures is critical. He joins us now. Kiyoda. Good morning. Good morning. Good, Corrin. How are you? Very well. Just remind people where you are at in the process of implementing change, this much-needed change to Oranga Tamariki. We're just at the starting phases. We've had one report after the Kahu Arroha on the how they're progressing and the next report is due out in July. So what's your key focus now in the role of chair? Working with Foranga Tamariki to expand its relationships into the communities, working with the communities around prevention of violence against children. Yeah, that push into the communities, working with the communities around prevention of violence against children. Yeah, that push into the communities is a key focus, obviously, of the changes that the government is pushing through from the recommendations. Give us a sense of how that actually works in practice and how it is working. Well, if I use one example, you have Waitomo up in Kaitaya. They have been working in a pretty good relationship with Orangatamiki for some time. They handle the majority, if not all of the cases, within their region. And they're dealing with it at the community end. The children are being placed with their extended faunae. Things are working very well. We want to push that model across the country. Is that possible across the country? Are you going to be able to have the level of expertise across the country to do that? Over time, it's not going to happen overnight. There are a number of organisations out, Māori organisations out there that are ready, are dealing with children at the moment. They just need a proper relationship with Orangatamariqi. So over time, this will be the other key part of the recommendation, which was obviously, I guess, more with the issue of uplifts, which was very controversial. These were only to be without no disorders to be used only after proper engagement with Fano. You would expect to see these drop, the numbers of them drop. There's been a dramatic reduction in Section 78 uplifts since the 2019 case in Hastings. There's already been a dramatic reduce. So you'd be pretty pleased about that then? I am. There's still a high percentage of those that are still enacted are still unnotified and that still needs to be addressed. The other aspect of the reforms is this new operating model and better training for social workers. Where are things at with that? It's in its starting stages. They have different models that they're working on. It's still a long way to go. It's a different approach working directly with the community. So there's a lot of upskilling needed internally also. So what is success going to look like when you've finished this role as the advisory board? A massive reduction of children coming into the Oranga Tamariki system that they are being dealt with back at home in the community. Hiora, thank you very much for your time, really appreciate that. That is Ta Mark Solomon, a chair of the Oranga Tamariki Ministerial Advisory Board. He's taken over that role. It is now 10 minutes to 7. EU researchers say that Irish travellers are one of the most discriminated against ethnic groups in Europe. The community experiences more than 80% unemployment, life expectancy up to 15 years shorter than average, and more than one in 10 deaths are caused by people taking their own lives. BBC Ireland correspondent Chris Page has this story which some may find upsetting. Swellyn was my sister-in-law. She was 32 and she died by suicide. My brother John was 34, he died by suicide. My cousin Paul... At a cemetery in Limerick, Mags Casey is reciting a rule call of despair as she poses beside each or neat headstone bearing pictures and icons. My second little cousin, Marilyn, she was 13, she died through suicide. She's witnessed generational devastation, a mental health crisis amongst Ireland's travellers. Ten years ago, I would have got a phone call to say my sister-in-law has committed suicide. Two years after that, her husband committed suicide, which was my brother. My other brother committed suicide because he couldn't live with the grief. It became nearly every month. So in total 28 members of my family would have committed suicide. So what would you say is the root cause? The root causes of the high suicide rates amongst the Traveyor community is because of the institutional racism, prejudice and discrimination that Travis face on a daily basis. What discrimination do you see happening to you just as you go and do things people take for granted? You know, not allowed served in restaurants, not allowed to hire a hotel for your kids' wedding, christening, engagement. So if you, you know, your husband or one of your children wanted to go out for, I don't know, a cup of tea or a meal, would you have to... I'd have to have a relationship with that service to be able to book it and that they'd know me and my family. Travellers identify as Ireland's indigenous people with a similar relationship to their country as the Aborigines in Australia for example. In the past, perhaps the most defining feature of their culture was a nomadic lifestyle. That's been very much eroded. We are using our people to suicide because our identity has been taken away from us. I've come to the Irish Parliament in Dublin where travellers are holding a demonstration. They say the discrimination they suffer simply wouldn't be tolerated by society if it was experienced by any other ethnic group. Here's Rosemary Mohan from the Irish Traveller Movement. Only 3% of us live past the age of 65 years of age. 80% of us are unemployed and only 1% of us reach third level education. Travelers have never seen a national outcry. Instead, people are silent. That is Chris Page, BBC Ireland correspondent there at 7 minutes to 7. Papers, the New Zealand hero tributes have flowed online for the man killed in an accident at ports of Auckland yesterday. Otara resident Ataroa Tua Iti died after a fall at the port while he was working for stevedore contracting company Wallace Investments. Wakato Times has a story on the possibility of state housing in Cambridge. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development intends to build high density housing on an 11.5 hectare plus of land in the towns north near the Waikato Expressway. UN appeal to avoid extradition is the headline on the Dominion Post, which has a story on a New Zealand resident's fight to avoid being extradited to China to face a murder charge. The press, leading with the news, St George's Hospital, a private hospital run as a charity, received $3.5 million in COVID-19 wage subsidies despite recording a hike in revenue during the pandemic. Finally, on the front page of the Otago Daily Times, a massive residential housing development plan for Queenstown's Ladies Mile has been referred to an expert consenting panel for fast-tracked resource consent, six minutes to seven. Quick note in Hawks Bay that Pakwafai Road is closed between Gilbertson Road and Hodgson Road, due to a crash near the Chesterhope Bridge. Power lines are down in the area. The road expected to be shut there for at least another hour. Well, now let's get on to Khorre Rokai Pakihi, Giles Beckford, Kjora. Thank you, Susie. Atomarev, in the business news this morning, medicinal cannabis company gets its first product on the shelves and says there's more to come. An insurance company's in-house panel- business gets a few industry fenders and the latest from the financial markets. East Coast-based medicinal cannabis firm Ruhr Biosciences says it has plenty of other products in the works after launching its first medicine in the country. Sales from the company of the medicinal cannabis product, which is available via prescription, will be the first revenue for the business since it listed on the stock exchange in 2020. The company couldn't say what the product is or how much revenue it expects to generate, but says it could be used to treat people with acute pain or anxiety. The chief executive Rob Mitchell says it's an important milestone for the company. We have a number of other products lined up. We hope to have in the market by the end of this year, and I'm talking local as well as export markets. It's all, you know, steps in the right direction. But it sort of shows that we've been able to navigate our way through, you know, the regulatory pathway and getting GMP certification and all the things that, you know, to be a pharmaceutical manufacturer are important. Rue is also not talking about what other products are likely to be available, nor what export markets it's eyeing up beyond Germany. Panel Peters and painters are raising fresh concerns about insurance giants move into the collision repair industry, saying consumers face less transparency. IAG, whose brands include AMI, NZI and State, has grown its own vehicle repair service known as Repair Hub in the country's four bigger cities. The Collision Repair Association is concerned that by referring repairs to an in-house operator, insurers can self-monitor their work. This general manager, Neil Pritchard, says consumers are left vulnerable when they deal with an insurer-owned repairer. The consumer is putting an awful lot of faith in one entity. First of all, the consumer pays their premium to that business. Then they make a claim to that business. That business decides on the validity of the claim, and now they're going to repair the vehicle. So the question really is, who's in the consumer's corner in that transaction? That's Neil Pritchard from the Collisional Repair Association. IAG replies that it's been open and transparent about its repair hub facilities and takes responsibility seriously as an industry leader. It says customers can choose whether to use repair hub or another company of their choice. Let's have a look now at financial markets. Wall Street hire. War, as seems investors are concentrating on strong company earnings reports that are coming through rather than the prospect of higher interest rates to combat inflation. Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up more than 400 points, that's 1.2%. The S&P 500 is 1.3% higher, and the NASDAQ is 1.8% higher. Local top 50 index back to its losing ways, falling 56 points yesterday, about half a percent to 11,836. And the New Zealand dollar, 67.3 U.S. cents, 91.2 Australian, 5.1.7 British Pence, 0.623 euro, 86.6 Japanese yen and 4.3 Chinese yuan. Brinkwood oil down $5.40, that's nearly 5%, at $107.US and 40 cents a barrel. And gold is down $23, that's 1.2%, 1,955 US an ounce. In time just to tell you that prices have taken another tumble in the latest global dairy auction for the third consecutive auction, down 3.6% for the main price to 4,885 US a ton. Whole milk powder, which of course influences payouts for local farmers, down 4.4%. Should say that prices are still around record levels. Back at Hanapar State. The Southern Tartick Skiller. RNZ National Corcorunday and Tene. Hiro, Susie, for example, it is Rapa. Wednesday, April the 20th. And there, the top stories. The Battle of the Donbas is escalating, with Russia unleashing thousands more troops on eastern Ukraine. There are calls for compensation after thousands of returnees entered MIQ, despite health advice to scrap the system. Also higher mortgage rates and lower demand are biting property developers. And $12,000 worth of fines have dished out each day on a new market bus lane. Who are ready to weather? A fine one for the lower half of the North Islands, but rain or showers elsewhere. RNZ News at 7 o'clock Meng, bit bitukw or Koroa, Anna Thomas Tane. Ukrainian forces say they're holding the line against a broad Russian offensive, despite RNZ News at 7 o'clock Meng. Bittipidok-Rour Anna Thomas Tane. Ukrainian forces say they're holding the line against a broad Russian offensive despite intense bombardment in the Lujansk region. They also claim they've made a successful counter-offensive in the Donetsk region. But the BBC's Anna Foster reports Ukrainian forces may struggle to continue receiving supplies. The supply line, I think, is one of the big issues at the moment, because of course if you picture Ukraine and the fighting is going on in the east, which of course is the Russian border, it means that everything that they are bringing in, or the vast majority of it, needs to come from the west. It needs to come probably across the border from Poland. It needs to come all the way across the country. And that is difficult in a time of war. And as we hear repeatedly, people like President Volodymyr Zelensky saying, they need weapons, ammunition, they need stuff to replace what they've lost in the first 55 days of this war. A man who failed six times to get a spot and managed isolation wants compensation for those who suffered because of the system. A Ministry of Health document shows that in November last year, top officials, Caroline McElnay and Ashley Bloomfield, told ministers MIQ was no longer justified, but the system wasn't abandoned until almost four months later. Richard LeMayer says people who stayed in MIQ from November should be paid back and those who suffered emotionally should receive a meaningful apology. The lottery came in and that was just shocking. As they described it themselves it was a lolly scramble and when I say inequity the most important thing there was a lack of compassion. The Ministry of Health says the removal of MIQ requirements was delayed by the Omicron outbreak. Property developers are cutting their asking price by tens of thousands of dollars, as the housing market continues to cool. They're struggling to get secure finance, get construction supplies on time and convince buyers to purchase off the plan. Emma Hatton reports. Properties going at a new development just north of Wellington have had up to $30,000 shaved off their asking price, and in Auckland, just over $200,000 was chopped off a million-dollar new build. Developers need to keep the cash coming in, with finance from banks now harder to come by and the money needed to settle on new projects. Some smaller firms are already coming unstuck and having to sell off half-finished developments to bigger companies. The banks are also asking them to write in longer sunset clauses so buyers can't walk away. The Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has used a speech in Singapore to encourage all countries to sign a United Nations treaty outlawing nuclear weapons. The treaty's been ratified by more than 50 countries, but not Singapore. Speaking at a gala dinner last night, Ms. Ardena told guests that disputes must be solved through dialogue rather than coercion, as seen in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. She went on to urge countries to sign the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Nuclear weapons are a dark cloud that hangs over us, one that feels ever-present. It is a fundamental mistake to believe that nuclear weapons can ever make the world a safer place for us or our children and our grandchildren. Jacinda Ardern will visit Singapore's port today, one of the busiest in the world. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given what he called a whole-hearted apology to Parliament after he was fined for breaking COVID lockdown laws. He says it didn't occur to him that the birthday party he attended at Downing Street in 2020 was a breach of the rules. The BBC's Ian Watson is in London. Boris Johnson's apology wasn't just said once by the Prime Minister. It was said about six separate times. I thought what was interesting was there was a change of tone from Boris Johnson from some of the previous occasions when potential law-breaking had been raised in the House of Commons by the opposition and by others. He didn't immediately go on the attack against the Labour leader at Secure Starmar. Instead, he mentioned his humility, they humbly apologised and they continued to do so when various MPs from the opposition benches stood up and called for his resignation. Police in Sri Lanka open fire on crowds protesting at fuel shortages during the economic crisis, leaving one man dead and 11 others wounded. The casualties in the central town of Rambakana came after live ammunition was used by police for the first time since protests erupted earlier this month. Demonstrators want President Got Dubai Rajapaksad to resign, but he's refusing to quit. Johnny Depp has told a court her allegations of domestic abuse have affected his reputation and his children. The Hollywood Star was giving evidence in a defamation case against his former wife Amber Hurd, who he's suing over an article she wrote in 2018 accusing him of abuse. He rejects accusations of violence. I wanted to clear my children of this hard thing that they were having to read about their father, which was untrue. I'd probably been in the industry 30 plus years, 35 years. Never had had any problems, anything like that. Last year, Johnny Jep lost a case in the UK against a British newspaper over an article that claimed he was violent towards Amberhead. A car towing a trailer in Hawks Bay crashed early this morning, bringing down power lines. The police say the smash happened between Gilbertson Road and Hodgson Road north of Hastings. Power provider, Unison, says more than 66 houses are without power, but it should be restored about midday. And three cars have been involved in an accident on Auckland's Northern Motorway this morning after a car was driving on the road in the wrong direction. The accident happened near St Mary's Bay in Auckland at around half-past three this morning. Two people have been taken to hospital in a serious condition. To sport now, and the Hurricanes assistant coach, Corey Jane, concedes losing hookah, Asafo Almoa, to a three-week suspension couldn't have come at a worse time. All 12 Super Rugby Pacific teams are in Melbourne for this weekend's round with the Trans-Tasman part of the competition kicking off. The Hurricanes will be in Australia for three weeks and Jane says being without Almor is a blow especially with all blacks hooker Dane Colts still unavailable. We're almost rung up Norm Hewitt and seen if he was going to come in and play for us because we've had a few things in that spot. But he's, you know, obviously he's massive to us and he's been playing some decent footy for us as well. So, but next guy up. The Hurricanes play the Reds on Saturday. British cycling says it's reached out to Sir Bradley Wiggins after the five times Olympic champion alleged he was sexually groomed by an unnamed coach when he was 13. 41-year-old Wiggins made the claims in an interview with Men's Health UK magazine and said the abuse had an impact on him as an adult. And that's the news. Remind us why Auckland Zoo didn't want Burma anymore? She needed somewhere to live out her twilight years. That's what's behind it, basically. Some pals for her to hang out with and to become a bit of an auntie figure amongst four other elephants. So what's going to happen to her now? They'll be ringing around to see who can take her in because it's really just not viable to get other elephants here. Yeah, no small feat finding some accommodation for an elephant.

It is 9.5 past 7. And you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Russia's new all-out assault on East Ukraine has escalated with the Kremlin unleashing thousands more troops in what is being called the Battle of the Donbass. Overnights, Russian forces pushed further into the besieged country's industrial hardland, which comprises the two big eastern regions of Luhansk and Dresk. Standing between them are some of Ukraine's best-trained troops already posted there because of the eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. Russia has claimed control of Kremlinia, an eastern town of 18,000 people, but the governor of Lohansk's region's administration, Sergei, said Ukrainian forces were now regrouping. Our defenders had to retreat because they were holding up the defence for two months, and the enemy was shelling every metre of our defence line, and everyone understood very clearly that there was nothing to hold on to there. There was no shelter. And our men were dying and not being able to hit the enemy. So they moved away. They settled new positions and will carry on fighting the Russian army, but in a more effective way. On the line from London is Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who is now a military strategist in the chief executive of intelligence consultancy. Cyberline. Good morning to you, Justin. Good morning. How are you? Very well. Are we entering a new phase now, this battle for the Donbass that is going to be something far bigger and different? Yes. Well, not bigger than the first stage of the conflict, certainly more focused. And therein is the difference. Russia's concentrated probably two-thirds of the force it had in the original invasion of Ukraine when it tried to do too much all around the country, now just in the southeast corner, really in the south of the country, to try and take on the best of the Ukrainian armed forces from before this phase of the conflict. And remember, this is a conflict that goes back to 2014. It started really after the fall of Crimea with the Dombas. It is no surprise, really. That's a focal area now, as Russia tries to get some sort of a victory, especially over the next two or three weeks, that Putin can use to justify his war today. We've seen the US announcing today sending more artillery and assistance with howitzes and things like this. Are we likely to see more of a sort of an open spaces tank battle in this particular exchange? Yeah, it is different terrain to that that you may have seen around Kiev. It's more open in places. There are longer sight lines. There are still woods and rivers and quite a few industrial areas. And the Dombas is the industrial heartland of Ukraine, something like 20% of the country's GDP comes out of Dornetsk and Luhansk. So it still has some very tight areas, some very congested areas that favour the defence, but there is more open areas that Russia can move across, or at least would be able to if the weather was better. So the weather has never at any stage, really, in this conflict, favoured Russia. The Thor came early, and a lot of their tanks were stuck in the mud, couldn't manoeuvre off roads. It's now now raining and so it is still muddy. A lot of areas are flooded and that's still going to restrict Russia's real ability to maneuver. And I think the fact they've gone now, despite the weather, shows their urgency to get this done. I think driven by orders from the top that they don't want to have a victory day parade with no victory to celebrate. And also the fact they're wary of these supplies flowing in from the West. I think Moscow getting increasingly irritated by the supply of equipment from NATO, the EU, Australia, etc. And they obviously don't like that at all. So they're trying, I think, to accelerate the pace and deliver this success in the next few weeks. We've seen in Mariupol the resolve of the pace and deliver the success in the next few weeks. We've seen in Mariupol the resolve of the Ukrainian forces, the Azov Brigade, obviously, hold up in the steelworks. Will we see similar sort of resistance with the bigger battle in the Donbass? They've obviously been battle-hardened over many years. Can they withstand the Russian advance? I mean, this is the question. I'd say there are some people who think it's clearly going to be a Russian victory. Some people who say, how could Ukraine use? I think I'm on the fence. I think all outcomes are possible. It's a fairly even match in many ways. But Ukrainian forces, as you say, are battle-hardened. They're extremely motivated against which they have been suffering from artillery bombardment, from air bombardment. Their supplies have to come a long way across the country, and they've been fighting for weeks without much relief. Obviously, so of the Russians. But I think that just does mean it is quite close. But the inspiration of the defenders, Mario Paul, and again, as you say, the people still holding out in Nazavstahl despite the bombardment they've received and despite 50 days of siege, that does show that these defenders can be very tenacious. And I think in the larger cities in the Dombas, you can expect prolonged resistance. The orders certainly seem to be to Ukrainian forces to hold in place, hold for as long as you can, do as much damage as possible, and just try and bleed the Russians dry as they advance. So what is the ultimate goal here for the Russians? What would be a victory that they could take back to the parade? Well, yes. Literally in this case, I'll add that I don't think the victory day parade will be the end of fighting. I think it'll probably move to yet another phase. But things depend really on the outcome of what Russia manages to deliver. And I think that'll tell us whether it's going to be peace, whether it's going to be a pausing conflict, whether it's going to go straight into a protracted, extended conflict like we've arguably already seen. And I think it really depends on if Russia can, at the very minimum, from their point of view, liberate Dornetsk and Luhansk oblasts completely. So they've controlled the south part of those two provinces since 2014-15. They've got most of the north of Luhansk. They're trying to get into the north of Dornetsk, and that's where the Ukrainian forces are. I think if they can achieve that, then they'll say we've achieved the liberation. But that falls short of everything they want to do in the country. And I think the talk of a lambridge to Crimea so that all of the Russian territory in Ukraine is joined up, that's very important to them. And if they could, they extend that to Odessa, at the very least, potentially Kharkiv. And of course, if the Ukrainian military completely collapses and the temptation will be to come after the whole country again. And there are 22 Russian battle groups still in Belarus, just north of the border, pointing towards Kiev still. They're rebuilding. They took a lot of damage. But they're still there for a reason. So lots of things that could yet develop in the country. Justin, thank you very much for that. Really appreciate it. Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who is now a military strategist. It is 16 minutes past seven. Up to 40,000 people could have skipped MIQ if the government had followed top health advice. A Ministry of Health document shows Dr Caroline McElnay and Dr Ashley Bloomfield advised the government that from November last year, MIQ was no longer justified. Now those who paid for quarantine want to be compensated and an apology for what they say is the needless stress they suffered. Tessa Gassir reports. Tepen Mazdin was trying to plan his wedding so his prospective in-laws could make it from Canada. It had been booked for February but they abandoned that date and planned to wed whenever the parents arrived. They had success with their fourth try in the lottery for an MIQ spot and had to frantically plan the rest of the trip in just 15 minutes. We don't hit that 15 minute window to basically get, I think it was about three or four connecting flights to get them here, so it was like 15 minutes of ridiculous hell. Tepen near Mazden says the thought that this experience could have been avoided is a bitter pill to swallow. It makes me very frustrated. That is incredibly frustrating to know that we didn't have to be on edge. We'll also during a pandemic and all sorts. Ella Foreman went to Melbourne for a working holiday last year when the Trans-Tasman bubble opened. But then cases started surging there, and New Zealand's borders were once again tightened. She just wanted to come home. Trying to nab an MIQ spot left her feeling homesick, heartbroken, and kicked in the teeth. Yeah, a lot of heartache, a lot of mornings where I would wake up and kind of be like, what the heck am I doing with my life? Like, is this really the position that I thought I'd be in? Like, it was supposed to be a fun trip. She spent 12 weeks waking up early each day to enter the MIQ lottery and is upset that stress may not have been necessary. Yeah, it's quite degrading almost like I had to enter the lottery and like a lot of heartbreak and to know that it probably wasn't necessary. A lot of sleepless nights and all that kind of thing. Richard the Ma wants compensation for those who unnecessarily paid for MIQ and a meaningful apology for those who suffered emotionally. He and his wife Ellie Payne spent months attempting to book a spot so Ellie could visit her mother in the UK who was having a hip operation. There six tries all failed and Ellie's mother had to delay the operation by three months. The lottery came in and that was just shocking. As they described it themselves, it was a lolly scramble. And when I say inequity, the most important thing, there was a lack of compassion. Richard the Mayor has since written to MPs, expressing concern for his own situation and the system in general. But he's had almost no response. The Ministry of Health says the staged and managed removal of MIQ requirements was delayed by the Omicron outbreak. 19 minutes past 7, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Higher mortgage rates and lower demand is starting to bite property developers. They are dropping prices and lengthening sunset clauses so buyers can't walk away if there are building delays. Emma Hatton reports. Properties going at a new development just north of Wellington have had up to $30,000 shaved off their asking price and in Auckland just over $200,000 was chopped off a million-dollar new build. They've had wide margins for years, but developers now need to do whatever it takes to keep the cash rolling in to fund their next project. Property lawyer Joanna Pidgeon says the market is getting tougher. We are seeing some smaller developers on sale. They might have bought it a premium, but they're looking to on-sale because they can't get their pre-sales and contain costs to build, so they're having to cut their losses and move on. Many are now negotiating longer settlement terms in a bid to buy time. That's something Lower Hut real estate agent Shane Brocklebank has seen in his patch. They're asking for settlement dates out 12 to 18 months, whereas previously they may have been able to only get sort of a three to six month settlement period. And so they may still be able to pay a decent amount of cash, not what it was, but they're asking for favourable terms to be able to get cash out of other developments to be able to settle that one. Campbell Venning runs a sales company which sells mostly investment properties off the plans. He says developers know they have to knock back the price in order to get a deal over the line. And a lot of them are already expecting it because they've been, let's call it, getting pretty good margins in the last year, in the last two years. So it's a very commercial and amical discussion that we have with them, but we just give them a reality check if they want to move stock, because stock's been sitting, they have to drop price or give some sort of incentive to encourage people to buy. Shane Brocklebank says a recent development in Levin saw developers do just that. We had sold 28 unconditionally before Christmas. After Christmas we dropped the price on four of those and they sold straight away, which got the developer to their finance position to be able to be tick in the box. Joanna Pidgeon says along with the cash flow hold-ups, developers are facing heat from their banks, with many asked to make sunset clauses longer so buyers can't walk away from a delayed build. The clauses allow them pull out at certain points if a development was falling behind. Only six months ago, RNZ reported on developers deliberately delaying projects in order to boot out their buyer, then resell for a higher price. 22 minutes past seven on RNZ National's Morning Report. Quick update on the traffic in Hawks Bay this morning. Pakofai Road is closed between Gilbertson Road and Hodgson Road because of a crash near the Chesterhope Bridge. Kietu Patu, be careful if you are driving there this morning. Now, people are legally driving in a Newmarket bus lane paid out more than $4 million in fines last year. The 160 metre stretch generated $12,000 a day. Here's for our Hancock with more. Head down New Markets, Kaiba Pass Road, intending to turn left into Broadway and you're faced with a dilemma. A bus lane extends almost to the end of the road, making shifting into the left-turning lane a last-minute exercise. Even during quiet weekend mornings, the bus lane is a no-go zone, as Damien Christie discovered. There's no one on the streets, and we drove down Kpass road to turn left onto Broadway to go to the cinemas, didn't think anything of it, and then a few weeks later, this fine shows up, man, it was quite a big fine. Shocked by the $150 fine, he went to have a look at the bus lane. He found signs twisted in the wrong direction, and the green paint often used to indicate a bus or cycle lane worn and peeling in places. There was actually literally a chunk of the paint sitting in the gutter that had washed away. That was in 2020, since then signs have been fixed and the green surface has been repainted, but motorists are still getting pinged. Almost 29,000 fines were issued last year to drivers who travelled more than 50 metres in the lane. This number has increased 241% from a 12-month period in 2016 and 2017. Damien Christie, who says he's all for bus lane enforcement, thinks something is wrong if the lane is still catching out so many motorists. Sometimes you get the sense that it is just absolute revenue gathering. I don't think there's any way they can justify that level of fines, that number of fines, that they're obviously not clearly letting people know this is where the bus lane is. John Strawbridge from Auckland Transport says the signage on the bus lane complies with legal requirements. He denies the lane as a revenue gatherer, but says sometimes fines are the best education. Although signage plays a vital role in helping ensure drivers comply with measures like special vehicle lanes, we do sometimes find that it takes a person receiving an infringement notice to drive real behaviour change and vigilance around special vehicle lanes. John Strawbridge says the increase in the number of fines is partly due to a switch to automated cameras and increased operating hours. The Automobile Association's Martin Glynn has a different take on the $4.3 million worth of fines. It seems massive for a short bus lane. Something's not right and it needs to be looked at. He says the high number of fines should be a red flag to the agency. Rarely Auckland Transport should be measuring success on how they can increase in compliance, get the infringement rate down and bring the public with them. Otherwise, people will just see this revenue gathering. Martin Glynn says that AA supports bus lanes, where they make sense. It's 25 minutes past 7. Cruise ships may be allowed back into New Zealand waters by October. But the industry says without a firm decision now, cruise lines may turn their backs on us. Under maritime COVID rules, cruise ships are banned. Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says Cabinet's waiting on further advice from health officials before making a final decision and an announcement is expected in the next few weeks. He says that October date could be brought forward. New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have given the go-ahead to cruises resuming with us now Chief Executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association Kevin O'Sullivan. Kjura. Good morning, Susie. So it seems that it's going to be October or possibly earlier. Is that not good enough? No, it's not. Because of the, you can imagine, the length of time this needed to plan. So we really need a decision, a public decision from government, almost immediately, in order for cruise lines to plan. We've already lost, as of yesterday when I looked, 250 port calls because of a lack of clarity from our government. So without that clarity, cruise lines are making a decision to deploy ships elsewhere and not come to New Zealand. And do you have a figure that you can put on that, a dollar figure of how much the country has lost in revenue? Well, in the sort of season that we would have expected pre-pandemic, it was around about the value of cruise to the economy was around about $600 million. So at the moment we've probably lost around about $100 million to $150 million in revenue. It's a bit hard to calculate exactly because it's a shift haven't come and the passengers haven't spent money. Then we're just going on assumptions. But yeah, it's certainly around about a third of predicted revenue would have been lost. And so for the rest of the world, how has the cruise industry bounced back? I mean, what percentage of pre-pandemic levels are we out? Well, there's over 80 countries have reopened to cruise already, and 95% it will take of global capacity of shipping will be back in operation at the middle of 2022. So the rest of the world is up and running. The Australia which was pretty well second last before New Zealand the first ship of the first cruise ships sailed into Sydney Harbour on Easter Monday. And so the two-year cruise van in Australia has already been lifted. It only really leaves New Zealand as a major player throughout the world that has still got no indication from government on when we can expect to see cruise ships coming back. Why is the decision taking so long? Well, we understand that the decision has to come, obviously, from Cabinet Ministers, but the recommendations have been with the ministers to some time now. And honestly, I don't know why it's taken so long. It seems to be something that has been resolved by officials. We've been in discussions with them since December, for example. For a while there, we were having weekly meetings to iron out all the details. So I understand the recommendation has gone through. It certainly made all their recommendations despite what the Deputy Prime Minister may have said yesterday. And it appears to be nothing to stop crews coming back. We had a report yesterday on that ship that went into Sydney Harbour on the programme yesterday. And lots of people were getting in touch, not very keen on the idea of the return of cruise ships, floating petri dishes, the reputation perhaps that goes with the ships, especially I suppose with the implications around the early COVID spread and COVID deaths here. You don't think that would put people off? Far from it. I mean, they're always going to be nice size in any industry, as you must be well aware. But cruise industry is leading the way with health and safety measures worldwide. Everyone is vaccinated, there's regular testing on board, enhanced ventilation, and proven health measures. So the sorts of situation that may well have existed more than two years ago have now been resolved. And as I said before before more than 80 countries are now reopened to cruise so those issues do not apply anymore and the demand by passengers is going gangbusters certainly in Australia now that they've got a time that's been set by government look thank you very much for your time Kevin O'Sullivan there from the New Zealand Cruise Association at Hapa 7. Kona Khorra al-Fa-Hira more ten aata. Coming up before eight on Morning Report, the Prime Minister is shamelessly plugging tourism and tourists to come to visit New Zealand as our borders begin to reopen. We'll speak to national leader Christopher Luxon about rising inflation and what he would do about it. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologises again for his part in the Partygate scandal, but the opposition is less than impressed. What a joke. Even now, as the latest merely mouthed apology stumbles out of one side of his mouth, a new set of deflections and distortions pour from the other. But the damage is already done. The public have made up their mind. They don't believe a word the Prime Minister says. That is Kiyosthama there, the Labour leader. You can hear more from him and Mr Johnson's apology. Before 8. Now the headlines with Anna Thomas. Thanks, Korn. Russia has launched its long-awaited all-out assault on East Ukraine with heavy fighting reported along the 500-kilometer front. It so far captured the small city of Kremlin in Lujansk region. However, Ukraine says it has successfully counter-attacked south of the country's second-larger city of Kharkiv. British military analyst Justin Krumpt told morning report that Russia is now focusing its forces to try to get some sort of victory over the next two to three weeks before the country's annual Victoria Day. He says Russia has, today been thwarted by bad weather, mud and flooding, and the fact that they're attacking despite that shows their need for quick results. A man who failed six times to get a spot of managed isolation wants compensation for those who suffered because of the system. A Ministry of Health document shows that in November last year, top officials Caroline McElnay and Ashley Bloomfield, agreed MIQ was no longer justified, but the system wasn't abandoned until almost four months later. Richard LeMayer says people who stayed in MIQ from November should be paid back and those who suffered emotionally should receive a meaningful apology. The Ministry of Health says the removal of MIQ requirements was delayed by the Omicron outbreak. The Solomon Islands has gone ahead and signed a controversial security agreement with China despite major resistance from local political figures as well as Australia and New Zealand. There are regional concerns the deal could open the door for Beijing to base its military in Honiara, but Prime Minister Manasei Sovigari says that is not the purpose of the Security Pact. The head of a company selling off-the-plan property says developers need to be prepared to drop their prices. Some developers are cutting their asking price by tens of thousands of dollars.

And this is Morning Report with Susie Ferguson and Corrin Dam. Well, New Zealand has rolled out the welcome mat in Singapore with the Prime Minister, shamelessly plugging for tourists to come visit as our borders begin to reopen. It is a key purpose of Jacinda Adirne's first trip abroad since COVID-19 saw New Zealand put up the barricades. Our deputy political editor, Craig McCulloch is in Singapore. This is Aalteaua back on the world stage, a cultural display to sell Singapore on the very best New Zealand has to offer. I understand many Singaporeans take honeymoons or family holidays in New Zealand with our wide open landscapes creating long-lasting memories. Let me assure you, we are ready to welcome you, be it for tourism, business or education. In fact, you may find us a little overly enthusiastic at first. The Prime Minister addressing a gillitzy gala dinner at the landmark Gardens by the Bay, while locals sampled New Zealand salmon, beef and wine. All of it a shameless plug, an invitation to visit, as New Zealand opens up to visa waiver countries from May 2nd. We are open for business, but it's also our arms that are open to. And so on behalf of the New Zealand delegation, I look forward to seeing you soon. No, rea, tena, tena goto, tena T'aato, tena T'ato kato. Singapore is New Zealand's fifth largest trading partner and was a key supply hub during the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical relationship to foster in the Indo-Pacific. Kea Ola and good afternoon. Thank you, Prime Minister Lee and Kjura. The charm offensive continued at the highest levels, Jacinda Ardun, sitting down with Prime Minister Lee C. and Long after a lavish welcoming ceremony. I welcome Prime Minister Arden back to Singapore. Very happy that she's made Singapore her first overseas visit since the onset of COVID-19. And very glad to meet her in person again after such a long time. It was their first face-to-face contact in more than three years, after COVID-19 halted international travel. The meeting more important for its symbolism than substance. They say that during tough times you're reminded who your friends are, and it is clear that Singapore is a very close friend of Altauo, New Zealand. A close friend very soon allowed back across our borders. Prime Minister, of course, you would be very welcome to visit New Zealand. We would love to reciprocate the warmth and hospitality you have shown us. The mission continues today with a visit to Singapore's port, one of the busiest in the world. Then begins the second league of the trip, Japan. Another country to Wu in New Zealand's welcome-back campaign. 21 minutes to 8 on Morning Report. Batch bookings over Easter were higher than they've been in years, as holidaymakers took the opportunity of a long weekend at Orange to get out and about. One company that hires out batches was 97% booked across the country. Jordan Bond reports. A mostly fine and warm Easter long weekend meant Kiwis got away from home in numbers not seen for almost two years. The website batch care rents out about 2.5,000 holiday homes. And over the weekend, just 80 of those batches were not booked. It's been the busiest we've seen since lockdown was lifted in 2020 and Queen's birthday saw a surge of bookings over that period. It's been busier than Christmas New Year 2021. It's just been an extraordinarily busy time for us. That's Zayna Razak, the head of marketing at batch care. Another rental website, Bookabatch was similarly chocker. Spokesperson Simone Scoper says their bookings were the highest since Easter 2019. Nelson region was one of our most booked destinations. There was only about seven holiday homes and batches that weren't booked out. Rode Rua, there was only three holiday homes left to book over that Easter long weekend. And, you know, there's hundreds of holiday homes that we do have in Rotorua. She says Auckland and Wellington were also popular for a city trip or people visiting friends and family. And it wasn't just batches, but campgrounds too. Joe Edmonds of Coramandel's top 10 holiday parks says they were flat out. Easter weekend fully booked, and Jack is fully booked. And I guess because they both coincide each other this year and the school holidays that people are probably just taking the whole week off. Queenstown Chamber of Commerce, Chief Executive Ruth Stokes, says the busy weekend was a good shot in the arm before the winter demand, which is still a couple of months away. She says there were a lot of people around and a lot of shopping bags under arms. It's been great. Certainly everyone's been busy, lots of people on the street, hearing a lot of people through the doors, retail hospitality, and a lot of visitors from up north, particularly Auckland and Northland. But she says Queensland accommodation bookings are still well down on pre-COVID times. Joe Edmonds and Coramandel says people do seem to be getting more confident about travelling again. It's been really good since the beginning of December with all the public holidays through January, February, now Easter. It's really nice after having such an uncertain two years. And Zana Razak agrees, saying many seem less nervous about leaving home. But some are still leaving bookings to the last minute. There's still bookings coming in for school holidays, and they're looking like a sell-out as well at this point. It's good that people are feeling more confident to travel. The coming weekend is a long one as well, and then there are two in June, Queen's birthday, the very first Matariki public holiday on June 24th. It is 19 minutes to 8, little bit of traffic. Parkalwai Road, Hawks Bay, is closed between Gilbertson Road and Hodgson Road due to a crash near the Chester Hope Bridge. There's a little bit of feedback coming in about bus lanes. You might have heard this story on the other side of the headlines earlier on. This was about the situation with a 160 metre stretch generating $12,000 a day. That's got you going. Absolute extortion, this person says. Same thing in Christchurch. There's one camera and it collects $1.5 million. Yes, another says extortion is the only way to describe what the councils are doing. Another person says, Re, the New Market Bus Lane, just as corners with a high crash rate prompt attention to see how to reduce crashes. What action has Auckland transports to identify just where and why most of these breaches are occurring and to look at ways to reduce the breaches by users like better road markings, signage, redesign of the lane? Nathaniel says regarding bus lane fines, all the high infringement numbers show if they need to increase the fines so people stop breaking the law and obstructing public transport for their personal convenience and why shouldn't the city gather revenue from inconsiderate drivers? There's another view. It is 18 minutes to 8. Now, galloping inflation and rising mortgage rates have had the government on the back foot this week, forcing them to argue New Zealand is not alone in what global phenomenon. Joining us now is the National Party's leader. Christopher Luxon, good morning to you. Morayna Corrin, how are you today? Very well, thank you. Yes, inflation tip to hit 7% record, well, it's been about 30 years since we've seen that sort of level. What would you do to try and bring that down quickly? Well, look, I think, you know, the government's been blaming a lot of it on international factors and there's no doubt there is an international component to it. But, you know, New Zealand at 6% heading to 7 when Australia's at 3.5. Primus is in Singapore. Yes, that's at 2. Japan's at 1. And so, you know, there is a global component for sure, but all those countries are dealing with the same challenges. So the key question is then what can you do domestically to get domestic inflation under control? And really, you heard it from Adrian All yesterday. You've heard it from the OECD, which is the government really needs to be really focused on reviewing spending and making sure that it's not, you know, we don't need to make cuts to spending and public services, but we do need to make sure that any wasteful spending or any incremental new spending, you know, we're getting a return for it. And we haven't been doing that. Well, let's talk about the allowances then. Obviously, this big one-off allowance of $6 billion is causing a bit of concern. Would you remove that? Would you cut that? Well, look, I mean, that's the conversation that we should be having. Why do we need to spend another $6 billion on top of? The government has increased government spending by 68% since it came to power. And the OECD months ago was saying, hey, listen, look, there's some amber lights on the dash. You're a small country. You're not a medium or a large size. You get smashed around with global economic challenges. And so you've really got to start thinking about that spending. Adrian All made the same comment as you know yesterday, sort of making sure we're using the fiscal levers that we have. I think there's three things they need to do. You know, the government would need to do. One is to make sure we're not loading cost up on business, particularly small business. The second thing is actually take a line-by-line item, and I'd have all those ministers going through their budget and saying what's working, what's not working, prioritising money so that we can maintain really good public services, but also make sure we're not wasting money any way. Okay. If that $6 billion allowance is up for discussion because that might exacerbate inflation, you would have to then look at your tax cut proposal as well? What we're saying is we would trust that our $1.7 billion on just inflation at just the tax and threshold. When the government's got $12.5 billion more in income tax, there's been 11.5% inflation since they came to power. That's a pretty simple way at which you've put real practical money into Kiwi's pockets. But it would be inflationary as well, though, wouldn't it? Well, it may well be, but there's no more inflationary than the $6 billion that Grant Robertson wants to... No, but what I'm saying is, would you reconsider the timing of those tax cuts or whether or not you could bring them in to try and help ease that inflation pressure on everyday Kiwis? No, I reckon that would be one of the things that could really... If you can get, you know, what is it, $1,600 to an average household, you know, in New Zealand, that would be helpful at this point in time, given what they're wrestling with. But the bigger point is, you know, as a finance minister, Bill English would do it, I can tell you, Nicol Willis would do it, you'd have all of those ministers going through line by line and saying actually what programs aren't working, where is that wasted money happening? And, you know, there's over $100,000 of existing government spending that's going on across the system that we should be asking. Let me put it another way, then. Would you look at a new debt target, say, back to the 20% that you had under the last national government? Well, we're all focused for now because, you know, and we'll talk about debt later on. But for us at the moment, it's really about focusing on spending. That's the advice from the OECD. That's the advice from Adrian Or. That's what we've been talking about since you and I started talking months ago about it. All right, you talked about businesses, not making life harder for businesses. Does that mean things like public holidays? How are you suggesting that life would be made easier? Are you talking about employment reform? Well, a simple thing for us would be, you know, while I start to look at things, you know, businesses are really struggling with skill shortages. And so actually doing, doing with opening up some of those immigration settings and getting those critical workers in place. So businesses can grow and do the right things and expand their businesses is important. Yeah, I agree. I think there's a lot of cost and compliance. The government passes the legislation in Parliament. They don't pay for those bills. They get paid for by businesses. Those costs get passed on to, you know, consumers. But what, like, are we talking about, would you deal away with the public holiday, for example, the Matariki holiday? Well, our view on Matariki has been, look, it's a great idea, a wonderful holiday, but which of the other holidays are you going to cancel? Because it costs the economy $450 million. It costs small businesses to... So would you cancel one of the other holidays if you come into government? That's what we've been saying since the bills come to Parliament. We're very supportive, Matabaki. Why don't we cancel Labor Day? And you'd actually do that, though? Well, you've got to ask some questions. How do you throw $450 million of extra costs on business at a time when we're dealing with a cost of living inflation, a cost of living and inflation, the highest it's been in 30 years, and higher than any of our trading partners. New Zealand's not doing a good job of managing inflation domestically at the moment because government's addicted to spending, and it's just spend, spend, spend, and it doesn't realize it's... Okay, what about food... Sorry to interrupt. What about food prices? Would you bust up the supermarkets? The government's sort of, well, it's hinting that it's going to take more action. We don't know exactly what yet. Would you support an actual intervention? Well, I think the Commerce Commission, Corrin, came out with some interesting ideas that if we put some real teeth to them, they could actually have quite a big impact. I worked for Unilever for many years and dealt with the UK grocery market at a time when some very similar challenges existed there as well, and the power was in balance. And I think there's a few things that I'd love to see work a little bit well and be prosecuted well. One is that land being freed up for supermarkets, because that's been quite restrictive. The second thing is a code of conduct with real teeth actually had real impact on the UK. And then likewise, if you've got some sort of independent sort of ombudsman or a person looking at what's happening in those dynamics, and they really are empowered to step in and call things as they see it, I think those things can make a big difference. But the government's hinting it's going to do those things, isn't it? I mean, you wouldn't go further. That's what I'm asking. Well, just from my own experience in the UK, the Code of Conduct and the independent person actually worked quite well. You know, to actually, but they were really empowered, and they had real powers and real teeth to actually do the job properly. And so if it's set up that way, if it's a wishy-washy code, if a person, you know, that's set up to monitor, it doesn't actually have any real powers and isn't really assertive enough, then it's not going to work. And we'll go back to the drawing board. But the Commerce Commission has done the review. They've come out and said, yes, there's some challenges. Here's some actions and recommendations. I think I'd want to see those things fight and make sure they're set up for success. Okay, just finally coming full circle here on the Reserve Bank. I mean, you have confidence in the Reserve Bank Governor that he's doing a good job, and would you remove the employment mandate that he has to abide by in terms of meeting those employment numbers? Yes, I mean, you and I've spoken about it before, but our view is very simple, which is the Reserve Bank should just be 100% focused on price stability, you know, and I've had this band of 1 to 3% inflation. Obviously it's getting away from us if it's getting up to 7. And inflation expectations are higher and that's leading to the OCR going up quite assertively. So our view is, yes, I would remove all the other mandates and secondary mandates that exist as well and just make it very, very focused on price stability. Christopher Luxem, thank you very much. National Party Leader, 10 minutes to eight. Up to 40,000 people could have skipped MIQ if the government had followed top health advice. A Ministry of Health document shows Dr Caroline McElnay and Dr Ashley Bloomfield advised the government that from November last year, MIQ was no longer justified. Now, those who paid for quarantine want to be compensated and an apology for what they say is the needless stress they suffered. Well, earlier on morning report, the National Party's COVID-19 response spokesperson Chris Bishop said, while it would be hard to pay out compensation, he understands the concerns of those who either spent time in MIQ hotels or missed out altogether on getting home. There are many people angry about it, and this is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with as an MP in the last my seven years as an MP. The MIQ cases, the human hardship and the tragedy that has come about because of it, I am hugely frustrated for many New Zealanders out there. Listening to that, the acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson, Morana. Morena. Why did it take the government three and a half months to act on this memo? Well, it didn't. So the memo arrived on the 15th of November, and actually Blenfield actually made an affidavit about this in one of the granted Kiwi's court cases where he himself said that given that a decision to end MIQ would be irreversible, he thought it was important to have that advice peer reviewed. That was done by Dr Tony Blakely and Dr. Philip Hill. And then advice arrived back just over a week later with Minister HIPkins. That advice said, yes, do this, but it needs to be a very careful transition. And Cabinet made a decision on that and announced it within days that we would make that transition in January. Of course, what then happened was that the Omicron variant arrived. We had to delay those plans through into February. And so actually, this is the system working how it's meant. Officials developed this advice, got it peer-reviewed, we came up with a plan, we implemented that plan, and MIQ did eventually get removed. But obviously the Omicron arrival pushed that date out a bit. If it is so straightforward, why was it that the OIA request wasn't simply released, while this memo just wasn't made public? Yeah, look, I mean, there are decisions that are made at the Ministry of Health level and with Minister HIPkins, and I don't have a particular insight into that. The one thing I would say is that perhaps the discussions that have been happening in the last 12 hours or so indicate why taking one document out of a series of decisions can sometimes lead people to draw conclusions that aren't quite right. There is no doubt that MIQ player has played an important role in keeping New Zealand as safe and making sure that we limited the number of deaths in New Zealand. Of course it's been frustrating for people, but what we wanted to do was make sure that our transition away from it was a careful one, and I think the right decision was made. Was it a disproportionate one, though? No, as Dr McElnay and Dr. Bloomfield noted, it was moving to the point where the proportionate approach would see self-isolation perhaps take over from MIQ as the normal way of people coming in. But they got that advice peer-reviewed, and it was agreed by Dr. Blakely and Dr. Hill that we needed a careful transition. We needed to consider cumulative risk. We needed to make sure we had the testing systems. We needed to make sure the health system was in good shape. We needed to make sure that vulnerable communities were looked after. So a plan was developed and actually the advice essentially was agreed to but over a slightly longer time frame than perhaps it initially had been envisaged. But the timing is critical. The timing is critical though because if this was the advice that was being given essentially by two top public health experts at the Ministry of Health, Dr Macalney, Dr Bloomfield, if they didn't appreciate the timing, does that not mean that the advice that they were putting forward was wrong? No, not at all. What it means is that that was the consideration that they had. They then said, this is going to be an irreversible decision. Let's get that peer reviewed. And throughout COVID-19, we've taken advice from a range of experts. And Dr. Bloomfield himself, as I believe, signed an affidavit where he says, I knew this would be an irreversible decision. I wanted to make sure I had the best advice. I think, Susie, it's really important to note that ultimately the advice was taken, but a phased and careful approach was agreed to. And then Omicron arrived, and in many ways that reinforced the wisdom of that phased and careful approach, because we needed MIQ, the likes of Mr Bishop and others actually ended up agreeing that MIQ could be, should be continued while Omicron was being dealt with. We were able to get more people boosted. We were able to make sure we got up to 90% vaccine double-backed. So it actually worked. But the 90% figure, to be fair, was reached on December the 16th. So MIQ continued for what, two months? Well, indeed, and there was time for more people to get boosted as well. And I don't think too many people were arguing when Omicrom was breaking out that we should have been getting rid of MIQ. For people, though, who stayed in MIQ, you can understand that they will feel frustrated about this. Should they be refunded those who stayed over that time period? I can certainly understand that people going through the MIQ process for the last few years have been frustrated, but ultimately that frustration is outweighed by the fact that we were able to save lives and keep New Zealanders healthy. And the tragedy of that would have been enormous had we not done that. And I know people had to sacrifice a lot going through MIQ, and I appreciate that sacrifice. But ultimately it was done for the greater good of all New Zealanders. And in terms of the compensation side, no, that's not something we're considering. So what would you say to people this morning who perhaps are listening to this or have heard this when it first broke yesterday afternoon? What would you say to those people who sat through MIQ or indeed people who had to wait to go through the lottery who perhaps lost loved ones in the meantime? Look, I understand the frustration and I understand the hurt that will have been caused that people were in those situations. What we have to do, though, is take a step back and say that MIQ played a really important role in making sure that many, many more New Zealanders didn't lose their loved ones and that we were able to keep New Zealand healthy. We carefully consider advice and ultimately made the decision that we were going to move away from MIQ. And then as the nature of COVID, Omicron came along. We had to delay that a little, but eventually we did move forward with that decision. And so I know it's been frustrating and tough for people, but New Zealand can be very proud of the fact that we've got through COVID with a limited number of deaths in our economy in good shape. And I thank everyone for their role in that. I'm curious, too, while of course you are always welcome to come on Morning Report, Chris Hickens, the COVID-19 response minister, is not the one fronting this. Why is that? Mr. Hipkins has some family-related matters this morning that meant that he couldn't do your show, so I'm happily stepped in for him. Thank you very much. Appreciate your time. That is Grant Robertson, the acting Prime Minister, there at two minutes to eight. Well, this has got you going. Lots of response to this story, and pretty much all of it is one way, in fact. Scott says, are people forgetting the summer we had as Omicron was kept at bay due to MIQ? It gave us time to get boosters to keep hospitalisations and deaths down. I personally think it was the right call. Sue says Omicron with open borders would have swamped our hospitals. Please remember how close we got, at least in Auckland, to ICU meltdown. And Richard says the disestablishment of MIQ was delayed by Omicron. End of story. Nothing to see here for the love of all that's good. Please don't restart the entitled travellers whining about it again. And Mark says, does the government get any breaks for their effort in managing a global pandemic with so many unknowns? Please look at how the public felt back then. There is no way we were going to let them open the border back then. Do of course keep that feedback coming into us. Always interested to know what you think about this. 2101 is how you can get in touch with the studio on text. Also morning reports at rnz.com.nz. Namihi O Te-Ata, Hiota, good morning, New Zealand.

In this hour, the US has pledged more artillery systems to Ukraine amid renewed Russian offensives. Up to 5,000 heritage homes could lose their special status in order to make way for high-density housing. Also before 9, the understaffed immigration service is under pressure to process thousands of residency applications that are coming in. Professor Michael Baker joins us to discuss the timing around the dropping of the MIQ system, and a new app is helping shoppers find the best deals on groceries. On Groceries. RNZ News at 8 o'clock. Good morning. I'm Anna Thomas. Ukrainian forces say they're holding the line in the east of the country as Russia continues its widespread offensive. There's intense bombardment in the Luhansk region and shelling in the city of Kharkiv. World Watchers Max Toll reports. Troops are clashing along a roughly 500 kilometre front line in the Dombas region. It's unclear how much progress Russian forces have made, but Ukraine says for now it's holding them at bay. Further north around Kharkiv, the Ukrainian military says there's been shelling of towns and the city itself, but that some of its troops are making successful counterattacks. Further south, the defense of Mariupol is reaching a critical stage. Russian-backed fighters are reportedly trying to storm an industrial complex, where some of the few remaining Ukrainian troops and civilians are said to be holed up. A man who was forced to change the date of his wedding because of managed isolation requirements says the government should have responded sooner to health advice. A Ministry of Health document shows that in November last year, top officials Caroline McElnay and Ashley Bloomfield agreed MIQ was no longer justified. But the system wasn't abandoned until almost four months later. Tiffany Marsden shifted his wedding date to accommodate MIQ spots for relatives from Canada and says the thought that his stressful experience was avoidable is infuriating. It makes me very frustrated. That is incredibly frustrating to know that we didn't have to be on edge. We're also during a pandemic and all sorts. The Ministry of Health says the removal of MIQ requirements was delayed by the Omicron outbreak. But the acting Prime Minister says the arrival of the Omicron variant held up the end to managed isolation. Grant Robertson told Morning reports the process worked as it should have. The head of a company selling off-the-plan properties says developers need to be prepared to drop their prices. Some developers are cutting their asking price by tens of thousands of dollars as the housing market continues to call. Campbell Venning runs a sales company which sells mostly investment properties off the plans and says developers need to do what they can to attract buyers. And a lot of them are already expecting it because they've been, let's call it, getting pretty good margins in the last year, in the last two years. So it's a very commercial and amical discussion that we have with them, but we just give them a reality check if they want to move stock because stock's been sitting, they have to drop price or give some sort of incentive to encourage people to buy. Campbell Venning says developers have had it good for years and the smart ones will get through the market slowdown. The Prime Minister will wrap up her trip to Singapore today with a visit to its port, one of the busiest in the world, and a critical supply hub during the pandemic. Jacinda Ardennes will then fly on to Japan this afternoon, having cleared the necessary pre-departure test. Here's our deputy political editor, Craig McCulloch. Ms Ardern began day two in Singapore with a business breakfast and an agreement to promote trade between the two countries. It's a key purpose of the trip, signalling New Zealand is open for business. Mazardun taught trade and global security with her counterpart, Lyssen Long, yesterday, and both leaders committed to working together on climate change initiatives. The second leg of the trip begins in Japan tomorrow. An Auckland bus lane generated almost $12,000 a day in fines during 2021. Barra Hancock reports. Last year, fines totaling $4.3 million were handed out for travelling more than 50 metres in new markets Kaiba Pass Road bus lane. Auckland Transport says the lane isn't a revenue gatherer, but sometimes fines are needed to change behaviour. The Automobile Association's Martin Glynn thinks the high level of fines indicate an issue with the lane. The new chair of the Oranga Tamariqi Advisory Board wants a massive reduction in the number of children being taken into care by Oranga Tamariki. Last year's highly anticipated Cahu Aroha reports said Tamariki Maori were not well served by Oranga Tamariqi. Sir Mark Solomon told Morning Report the Child Protection Agency is just starting to implement change and the number of children in state care must come down. The UN World Food Programme is warning a prolonged drought across the Horn of Africa could put up to 20 million people at risk of hunger. Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya are worst hit. The World Food Program's Regional Director for East Africa, Michael Dunford, says the need for rain is now urgent. We're now waiting for the current rainy season to arrive. It's late, and we're very concerned of what the implications will be if it is below average. We need the ability to respond. We need the rain. Wheat supplies have been affected by the war in Ukraine and the price of food and fuel has shot up. Global dairy prices have fallen for a third consecutive auction but remain near record levels. The average price at the fortnightly global dairy auction fell 3.6% to $4,885 US a ton after falling 1% in the previous auction. The price of whole milk powder was down 4.4% to $4,207 US ton. Dairy farmers are in line for a record payout this season with current forecasts around $9.50 a kilo of milk solids. An influential panel of scientists is calling for the U.S. Space Agency NASA to prioritize emission to Uranus. The ice giant is the seventh planet in the solar system, orbiting the sun 19 times further out than the Earth. It's only ever been visited once before in a brief flyby by the Voyager 2 probe in 1986. Researchers think an in-depth study of Uranus can help them better understand the many similarly sized objects now being discovered around other stars. That's the news. Now here's sport with Barry Guy. Hurricanes assistant coach Corey Jane says while technique is a problem for those players being red-carded in the game, hooker, Asafa Amor, suspension was more to do with being careless. Amor was one of three players suspended from last weekend's round of Super Rugby with all three incidents involving contact with the opponent's head. Jane says that in a game like rugby it's going to be difficult to get it right all the time, but players and coaches need to keep working on it. His one was just, I think, careless at the Ruck. A couple other ones, I think it's really big on technique that if you're going to fly into a tick or if your arm stuck like that, then you're probably going to get in trouble. So we've just got to be better as people playing this game to try to get it as best ride as possible. And it is a safety issue, but it is a contact sport as well, so you're not always going to get it right. Jane concedes losing Armour for three weeks is a blow, with the All Blacks Hooker Day and Coals still unavailable due to injury. The New Zealand teams head to Australia this week with the Hurricanes playing the Reds. Former Silver Fern Squad member Jess McLennan is relishing being back on the court after thinking her netball career was over. The defender suffered her third major injury in 2018 and stepped away from the sport. But last weekend she played for the tactics after answering an SOS call to join the COVID-affected squad. The tactics play again tonight against the stars in Auckland, and McClendon says it's surreal to be back in the premiership. It was a really exciting moment for me and my family to get back on court after such a long time away. And I guess my career ending on not the best terms, so yeah, it was pretty cool. The tactics are fifth in the standings not the best terms. So, yeah, it was pretty cool. The tactics are fifth in the standings with the stars fourth. Two-time world rowing champion, Olivia Lowe, has announced her retirement from the sport. Lowe and Brooke Donahue won 20 of 22 international double skulls races between 2017 and 2019, including two world championship titles. And Liverpool is set to go top of the English Premier League. They lead Manchester United 2-0 at halftime at Anfield. Huyana, Puroongu, Hakenikina. On 9 to noon today, does an overseas holiday beckon?

Join me, Lynn Freeman, in for Catherine Ryan on 9-to-noon on RNZ National. And now the short forecast from Met Service until midnight tonight. Northland, Auckland and Coramandel Peninsula, cloudy with scattered showers. Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Taupo and Gisbon, mostly cloudy with a few showers, but occasional rain or drizzle about the Bay of plenty. Oaks Bay and Wired up are fine, apart from patchy morning cloud or fog, Waite Tomor to Wellington, including Taumaranui and Taihape, cloudy periods, morning drizzle for Wellington and Carpity, and a few afternoon and evening showers further north. Nelson, Bulla, Westland and Fjordland, rain about Nelson and Bulla spreading elsewhere this morning, some heavy force developing this afternoon with possible thunderstorms from this evening. Malbred, Canterbury, Othago and Southland, cloudy periods with morning, low cloud or fog about the east coast, scatterbrain developing for inland Malbara and most of Othago and Southland from late morning. And for the Chathamilands, cloudy periods with a possible morning shower. Looking at the main centres, Auckland, Tamaki Makoto, cloudy showers, easing this evening, northeasterlies, fresh and exposed places 24, Tauranga, cloudy with periods of light, rain or drizzle, northeasterly's fresh for a time this afternoon, 22. Hamilton, Kittikirroa, often cloudy with the odd shower, northeast breeze is 24, Wellington, Fanganui, Atara, cloudy at times with areas of drizzle this morning, northerlees, becoming fresh this evening, 21, Christchurch, or Tautahee, areas of morning, low cloud or fog, otherwise fine with increasing high cloud northeasterlies developing this morning 23 and Dan Eden, Otiporti. Often cloudy, some rain possible this evening northeasterlies and a high of 20 degrees. Sarenz National, it is 10 past 8. And you're listening to Morning Report with Corandan and Susie Ferguson. The US has pledged more artillery systems to Ukraine amid a renewed Russian offensive in the east in what's being dubbed the Battle of the Donbass. This morning, President Biden took part in a 90-minute video call with NATO and G7 allies to consider a response to Russia's escalation. The United States is delivering an array of weapons, including how it's a gun systems, as well as other heavy-duty equipment, all part of an additional $800 million weapons package. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby spoke to media a short time ago. We've definitely sourced the 18. We know where they're coming from. It's really just a matter now of getting them packaged up and getting them on the way. They'll be coming from the United States. And again, I think it's really very, very soon, a matter of days here. And same for the ammunition. We believe we'll be able to pull virtually all of that out of preposition stocks that are already in Europe. So it won't take very long to get the artillery rounds where they need to go. And as for the other systems, I don't have any specific training scenarios to speak to with respect to the two radars, the two portable radar systems that we are providing Ukraine. Again, we don't believe that in those cases that there's going to be anywhere near an onerous training process for that. These are counter-artillery radar and a portable air defense radar system, the Sentinel, which you tow behind a vehicle. It's not equipment that the Ukrainians intrinsically know how to use, but we don't believe it's going to take very long to get them the proper familiarization. They are exactly the kinds of systems the Ukrainians have been asking for, and they are tailored and designed, the things that we're giving them, tailored and designed for the fight that we know they're in now in the Donbos and will be in coming days and weeks. So, I mean, artillery, the radar systems, the coastal defense unmanned systems that we're talking about, as well as, again, continued deliveries of small arms and ammunition. That is the Pentagon's press secretary, John Kirby there at 13 minutes past eight. The heat is on the understaffed immigration service to process thousands of residency applications as employers cry out for labour. Immigration New Zealand is being blamed for students and migrants facing big delays getting into the country, but as Jill Bonnet reports, it has lost 20% of its workforce since the start of the pandemic. Frenchman Muneziati has been waiting for his skilled migrant residence application to be decided since October 2019. He says about half of the 2,600 people in the same situation are, like him, still overseas and very highly skilled as they had reached the immigration points threshold without a job offer. But with only 10 people working on their visa type since the new residence visa was introduced last year, some have been waiting for a decision since Christmas 2018. To earn 160 points without a job offer in New Zealand, you have to be very, very skilled, have a high degree diploma, at least master's degree and so on. So basically we are a lot of skilled people who are waiting and put it on hold our lives. Still, he counts himself lucky. He and his family don't need a visa to visit, so they're coming to look around in a fortnight's time. Those coming from a country needing visas, such as China, India and South Africa, will have to wait till October under the government's current border reopening timeline. The National MP, Penny Simmons, says that's damaging the economy, and it's down to Immigration New Zealand. We've got this incredible bottleneck because immigration New Zealand is not able to process quickly enough across all the visa areas to get our industries going at full speed again, whether it's in the critical worker or the international student visas, we have got a bottleneck because of Immigration New Zealand capacity. She says it means only 5,000 students will be allowed in in time for the second semester. Immigration New Zealand has 180 or 20% fewer workers than before the pandemic. Those staff left are dealing with 91,000 applications for the one-off residence scheme since December, 181,000 people. And next month, the twice-delayed accredited employer work visa will begin to replace six work permit categories with the first visas due in July. Staff will initially need to approve each employer as well as the worker before a visa can be issued. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announcing the border reopening timeframe last month said visa processing capacity was key. The major issue there is not a question of safety, but a question of the ability to process those new visas in a timely way. Keeping in mind, we're already dealing with a large number of people who are now being made residents through recent decisions and gearing back up a lot of visa processing. But Immigration Policy Manager Ruth Isaac says capacity is only part of the reason for the delay in opening to the rest of the world. Ministers took into account the volumes of arrivals they wanted to have in light of the potential Omicron Peak and remember these decisions were taken before we were in the volumes of arrivals they wanted to have in light of the potential Omacrom Peak and remember these decisions were taken before we were in the middle of it. They were waiting for the travel health declaration system to be in place so that we had automatic ways to ensure that people were meeting the health criteria for entry to New Zealand, which has just come into place, and they were trying to balance a number of things. Immigration's general manager of border and visa operations, Nicola Hogg, says it's recruiting for more New Zealand staff and has opened a second office in Christchurch after closing three overseas offices last year. It is 17 past 8. Plans for high-density housing in Auckland could see up to 5,000 heritage homes lose their special status, making it easier for them to be bulldozed. The city council is required to boost housing across the city and has released draft maps of the areas proposed for six-and-three-story apartments. Many are suburbs with character villas like Davenport, Kingsland and Riemueira. Jonti Dine went out for a visit. This Remua local couldn't be clearer. No, I'm not in favour. I think it's terrible what they're doing. Shocking. She says it will do little to house those in need. The houses that are being pulled down and then expensive apartments going up, that's not what the housing crisis is all about. That's just money-making and it's time it was stopped because the good areas are now becoming apartment blocked out and houses a secondary. Kingsland local Sarah Bishop doesn't want to see heritage buildings go and says there are better places in the city for higher density housing. There's a lot of single dwelling homes out in the suburbs and stuff that maybe they could knock down those and do more higher density housing which i think is happening but there's a lot of like not in my backyard stuff going on in those kind of suburbs right now yeah so it's a shame to see these sort of local town centers being taken out. Auckland property developer and former president of the Auckland Property Investors Association, David Whitburn, backs the changes but says they won't happen overnight. He argues many of the heritage homes don't boast any particularly impressive history. I think there's an overreaction for many people that are fearful about the neighbourhoods changing, but we also do have to think of others, show a bit of mana, Akitanga and care and respect for other generations too, because how do we house our younger generations, in some cases, how do you provide housing for your children and grandchildren? He says it's imperative new developments are accessible to all. We've got to be a bit careful because some of these centres that Auckland Council have been talking about though are in areas that aren't super duper affordable such as around New Market and Takapuna, botany, these areas aren't well known for affordable housing. Another Remiwera resident, Andrea, says she is acutely conscious of the housing crisis. I'm deeply concerned about the fact that we have a generation or more of young New Zealanders without the ability to purchase a house and perhaps unless their parents are fronting up, I'll be one of those parents. It'll probably be dipping into my pockets to help my children afford a house. I've got children who said I won't ever be able to move back to New Zealand to live until I'm in my 50s. She says fixing Auckland's housing crisis is a complex issue. I think we have a tension going on between the cost of housing, the availability and the need to preserve the character of suburbs. So I think it's a very difficult situation. I know there'll be upset people. At the same time, I don't like the fact that people are living in motels and cars. And David Whitburn has a message for fellow Aucklanders firmly attached to the idea of living in a single house with its own section. Reality is everyone would love to be able to buy nice sections like that for whatever it was, $18,000, 40 years ago, but it's just not a reality for so many, and we've got to think of others and think about some younger Kiwis and try to, and particularly in Auckland, try to improve home ownership options, helps building communities, keep them here. The Council is opening up its plans for public consultation today, ahead of notifying changes to its planning rulebook, the Auckland Unitary Plan mid-August. 20 minutes past 8, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Well, Auckland Councillor Chris Darby is the chair of the planning committee and joins us now. Kiyoda, good morning. Okay, why are you doing this? I mean, the government's made it pretty clear, along with the support of the opposition, that it wants these changes. Just talk me through exactly why you need to go through this planning process when there really isn't much scope for it, is it? Well, this is an edict from central government, as you mentioned, both Labor and National came together last year and amended the national policy statement on urban development through the Enabling Housing Supply Act. They jointly agreed to direct all the major councils, including Auckland, and that requires us to add heightened density pretty much right across the city, with a few exceptions, but you're not allowed any blanket protections like special character areas unless you have good, strong, evidential proof. Right, and so what are you proposing with these plans? You've identified some suburbs, which you think do need that. Yes, look, we've identified the city centre for greater density and the walkable catchments, as we term it, around the city centre, 10 metropolitan centres as well, and then the walkable catchments to the rapid transit network. In Auckland, that is our rail network and our busway network, which is the northern busway. And then there are a number of centres which we deem to be highly accessible through good public transport links that will also see greater density. And all of that is in response to the central government edict to do so. Right. What is walkable? How far? Walkable catchment where our preliminary response, say, for the city centre, is around about 1,200 metres, say 15 minutes. That walkable catchment would see the government requires us to put in at least six stories in that area. And when you go to the metropolitan centres like Tuckapurna or Newlin and out many, and there's about eight others, it's say 10 minutes. That's the walkable catchment. And the government requires us to assign a minimum of six-storries in that area as well. And then for smaller centres, it could be a five-minute walk. Right. So in time, in say 20 or 30 years' time, people could expect to see far more six-story buildings in those areas around those transport hubs. Auckland will look different in that sense. Over time, it will. I would say that change would be slow. Some areas there might be quick uptake. The market might see an area as being highly desirable. Whereas another part of Auckland, even though the planning instruments allow the greater density, it won't be taken up. That is just how the market responds. So how do you choose which are the suburbs that have the nice bungalows that should be looked after and which shouldn't? As someone who's not living in Auckland at the moment, I find this hard to grasp. I see a lot of debate about it. Explain to people who don't live in Auckland, how is it fair? How does it work? Well, in the Auckland Unitary Plan, we have a category of exemptions to greater density, and it's these special character areas. Now, the Labor National legislation expung that. It struck it out entirely. So special character is gone if we, if Auckland Council did not intervene and identify special character as being important and Auckland Council has decided special character is important but we have to make sure that we've got strong evidence none of these special character areas have been assessed for 20 years or more they were not assessed going into the Auckland Unitary Plan process. So just let me stop you there. So just give me an example of some of the suburbs. Was Ponsonby one of the suburbs that's going to have special? Ponsonby, Freeman's Bay. Right. I mean, these are very wealthy suburbs. There will be some, you know, might say, why are they getting special treatment? They're just, obviously, the nice bungalows and nice house, villas, but why are they special? Well, they make up a unique part of the built fabric of Auckland, and if you go to great cities around the world that have grown and have added density and height, if you go to Sydney and you look at the Paddington Terrace houses, you go to London or Seattle, or many, many other cities, you'll see that the cities have actually retained the fabric that helps identify that city in part, and we're doing the same. But we are reducing that special character area because our evidence says that some parts of these special character areas of old do not stand the test. They do not pass the test. All that's being asked, though, isn't it, that a three-story apartment block could go in, they're not going to have to knock buildings down. I mean, over time, as things move on and people make decisions, what's so bad about, just tell me, I'm curious, what's so bad about a three-story apartment, nice style block in Ponsonby? And you're correct. The difference between the zoning of a special character style block in Ponsonby? Correct. The difference between the zoning of a special character area is generally between two stories enabled and three stories and three units per site. Some would say that's not great. A great difference that is. Others would say it's a huge chasm between. But I think you will see if this proceeds and some of the special character protections come off, then you will see only a very slow progression to development in those sites. Chris Darby, thank you very much for that. Really appreciate that. So very interesting Auckland councillor there, the chair of the planning committee. Aucklanders will be able to have their say on it. I'm sure they will. It is 26 minutes past eight. Well, let's go back now to that Ministry of Health memo that the MIQ system could have been mothballed in November last year. It took another three and a half months, seven voucher lotteries and almost 40,000 more MIQ stays before most incoming travellers were allowed to enter without a mandatory stint in a hotel. Let's go now to epidemiologist. Professor Michael Baker from the University of Otago. Atomare, Rina, Susie. Now, this memo from the Ministry of Health made public yesterday that was peer-reviewed, and it said, you know, Tai Ho, was that the right thing to do? Yeah, look, I listened to the coverage, and I think from a public health point of view, Grant Robertson did summarize the situation quite well. And that the pandemic was changing. It's great that the Ministry of Health was doing regularly updated risk assessments. And I think when they signed off that, the assessment on the 15th of November, that was accurate that the risk of imported cases of Delta variant was starting to get quite low relative to transmission in New Zealand. And that did, of course, feed into the revised reconnecting strategy, which was released on the 24th of November, and that called for relaxation of entry requirements from mid-January. So I think that was the plan. And, of course, it changed with the emergence of the Omicron variant, as we know, in November. And seeking that peer review of this initial advice, is not quite the right word, but this initial plan, is that something that happens frequently with the health advice or was it that this was deemed particularly pivotal yeah you'd have to ask the ministry of health about that i i know this was a really quite a big shift for new zealand to opening um or relaxing controls at the border because remember that's pivotal to our elimination strategy you can't operate that approach without managing borders tightly and that has saved over 10,000 lives in New Zealand so it was a big move for New Zealand to make and so I think it was the right thing to do to get some peer review it's pretty extraordinary timing isn't it that this that this came out, I suppose, while Delta was still ongoing, before Omicron certainly had got here, and that peer review effectively bought extra time? Yeah, it did. And again, the government's approach has been quite cautious throughout, and I think that's benefited New Zealand. And it just takes account of the fact that pandemics are very unpredictable. So the net effect was, of course, that we got our first case of Omicron detected in the MIQ on the 16th of December. Shortly after that, government announced another change in response to that. And that was on the 21st of December. It said we're going to delay the opening of borders up until the end of February and a number of other changes in terms of shortening the interval for boosters and so on. And this approach, being very responsive, I think, to Omicron did give us a lot more time right through to the end of January before we got Omicron circulating widely in New Zealand. And unlike much of the world, we were spared having this really intense Omicron wave over the Christmas New Year period. I think we all benefited from that. And as a result, I think the overall impact of this Omicomicon wave has been much less than New Zealand would have been. Namihi, thank you very much for your time. Michael Baker there from the University of Atago at Hapa State. Speaking of borders, opening some news coming through this morning that Harry Stiles will be playing in Auckland. One of the first big new concerts to be announced, of course. More are expected. I think he's going to play. When is it? It might be kicking off on February the 20th. I'm heading for Auckland's Mounce Martialm Mart Stadium, March the 7. Giles Beckford will be there, I know. Giles, you're right. Kura, Karen. I'll take that as a no. I might be washing my hair that day. Let's have a look at Wall Street's. Witt has closed strongly higher. Investors clearly buoyed by some of the strong company earnings reports that are coming through, putting behind them the prospect of higher interest rates to combat inflation in the meantime, and not phased at all by the IMF cutting global growth forecast for the second time this year. So the Dow Jones Industrial average 1.4%, higher S&P 500, 1.6%, and the NASDAQ, 2.1%. Can't buy a trick on the local exchange, though. It fell 56 points yesterday, half a percent, starts the morning at 11,8336. New Zealand dollar, 67.3 U.S. cents, 91.2 Australian, 51.8 British Pence, 0.624 euro. 86.8 Japanese yen, we should note that it's near a seven-year high, largely because of Japanese currency weakness, and 4.3 Chinese yuan. Brent crude oil is down $6, that's about 5%, at $107.20 a barrel, and gold is down $29, that's more than 2.5%. Just under 1,950 US dollars an ounce. Those market numbers and all the business news updated for you at around 20 past 12 in midday report. Kiyadh, Giles, Fai Aki Ney still to come before 9 on Morning Reports. We find out more about a new app, helping shoppers find the best deal on groceries. China says it signed an agreement on security cooperation with Solomon Islands and we sent our reporter to a playground to hear her parents and children are feeling about eased restrictions under the COVID orange light. Most people when they get the COVID after they have vaccines, they get only a little cold or something like that. And I have already had my second jab. I had it last year. I have had a lot of big feelings when I went to school. And I think it will really help me that everyone can speak clearly to me. It makes my life a lot easier. More reaction coming up. Kura Taita de Wa Mottika Wurongo, now news headlines and Anna Thomas. Russia has made a third surrender offer to Ukrainian troops hold up in a giant steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol. Its defense ministry says Russian troops will observe a ceasefire during the offer. Previous offers have been rejected. Elsewhere, there's heavy fighting along a 500-kilometer front as Russia carries out a new offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russia says it hits 1,200 military targets with missiles and artillery. The acting Prime Minister says Omicron held up an end to MIQ recommended last year. The government's Minister says Omicron held up an end to MIQ recommended last year. The government's facing heavy criticism for waiting until February to ditch the hotel isolation, even though Dr Caroline McElnay and Dr. Ashley Bloomfield told the government from November last year it was no longer justified. Grant Robertson says the government held back when the new variants spread wildly overseas. He says a delayed in to MIQ bought time to lift vaccination rates. The National Party leader says the government is addicted to spending and is making inflation worse. Another high quarterly inflation figure is expected to be released later this week, possibly taking the annual rate to about 7%. Christopher Luxon told Morning Report the government has blamed COVID supply chain issues and the Ukraine invasion. But Mr Luxin says the Australian inflation rate is half that of New Zealand and less again in Singapore and Japan. He does not advocate cuts to government spending, but says it has to make sure there is no wasteful spending. An Auckland property developer is urging locals to get over their attachment to heritage homes. Plans for high-density housing could mean up to 5,000 heritage buildings in Auckland are demolished. The former president of the Auckland Property Investors Association, David Whitburn, says many of the heritage homes don't boast any particularly impressive history. And that's the news. Hiora, I'm Amil Donovan, and today on the detail, The End is Nye for one of the most controversial justice policies in recent memory. So how will history judge the three strikes for? Sending a mentally ill man to jail for seven years because he kissed someone on the street. That's just such a terrible thing to do in our society. We can't believe our parliament. We want us to do it, so we won't. The detail on Apple, Spotify, RNZ, or wherever you get your podcasts.

But let me begin in all humility by saying that on the 12th of April, I received a fixed penalty notice relating to an event in Downing Street on the 19th of June 2020. I paid the fine immediately, and I offered the British people a full apology. And I take this opportunity on the first available sitting day to repeat my whole-hearted apology to the House. As soon as I received the notice, I acknowledge the hurt and the anger. And I said that people had a right to expect better of their Prime Minister. And I repeat that, Mr. Speaker, again in the House now. Let me also say, not by way of mitigation or excuse, but purely because it explains my previous words in this House, that it did not occur to me then or subsequently that a gathering in the Cabinet room just before a vital meeting on COVID strategy could amount to a breach of the rules. I repeat, that was my mistake and I apologise for it unreservedly. Well, response came quickly from Labour Party leader, Secere Starmar, who said the Prime Minister's apology was an insult to the public. What a joke. Even now, as the latest mealy-mouthed apology stumbles out of one side of his mouth, a new set of deflections and distortions pour from the other. But the damage is already done. The public have made up their mind. They don't believe a word the Prime Minister says. They know what he is. As ever with this Prime Minister, those close to him find themselves ruined. And the institutions he vows to protect damaged. Good ministers forced to walk away from public service. The Chancellor's career up in flames. And the leader of the Scottish Conservatives rendered pathetic. For all those unfamiliar with this Prime Minister's career, this isn't some fixable glitch in the system. It's the whole point. It's what he does. It's who he is. He knows he's dishonest and incapable of changing. So he drags everybody else down with him. The more people debase themselves. Carroting is a... Order! The opposition leader beat his call for Boris Johnson to resign and urged Conservative backbenchers to oust him. If he won't, however, many Tory MPs have welcomed the repeated apologies. It's 19 to 9. Now, as we know, the cost of living is soaring and it's pretty doubtful things will ease anytime soon. But when it comes to groceries, there is now a free website that can help people snag the best deal, at least. grocer.nz compares prices from three major New Zealand supermarkets, just the three, sadly. It started as developer Rock Wong's hobby project until he posted about it on social media. That's when it went gangbusters. Rockwon joins us now. Good morning. Good morning. So just give us an idea, a sense of how this website works. How easy is it to go on and compare prices from your local supermarkets? Yeah, as you said, it's my one of a hobby project, and basically it collects price data from the official shopping website and present in a kind of unified form to the users. So you can, so for myself, for example, I can find the countdown in the new world in the local, my local suburb. I can then cross-check different vegetables, for example, to see which is the cheapest. And that's pretty easy to do? Yeah, sort of. Yeah, just basically you click all the price data for all the products, of course, all the store, and then you mess them up across all the supermarkets. And you have been swamped, have you? People have obviously taken to this. Yeah, I didn't imagine it's such an overwhelming, positive receptions from the users. Yeah, it's against my hobby project, So, yeah, it's really good. How much time are you having to put into it as a hobby project? Well, I didn't count hours, but I started this project early this year in general, and until recently I put it on social network. And I see people can, you know, you can scan bar codes as well, so it's reasonably sophisticated. Yeah, it's one of those sort of nice new features there. Actually, I use barcode as a product, of course, the supermarket as well. So I thought, yeah, it would be a good idea if users can use the barcode to find the product as well. So at the moment, you're a website, right? Do you want to try and turn it into an app that would be even more user-friendly for people when they're doing their shopping? Yeah, a lot of users find it's pretty, it's a bit of hard to keep the app in their home screen on the mobile. So maybe I consider it to web it in a kind of app and put it out of app store or Play Store. You might need to make a pitch to a few angel investors who might be interested. Sounds like you might have a bit of support. Yeah, hopefully. I mean, is this something seriously you would look to take as a full-time sort of role? Well, I do have a day job at the moment, and I quite like it, but I didn't rule out in the official commercialization or monetization on this thing. But so far, I'm happy to keep it free, you know, as long as I can manage the cost on the server at my own time. Yeah, well, I guess it shows, doesn't it, that just how much people are feeling it with prices at the supermarket and how sensitive it is at the moment? Well, yeah, that might be true, but, I mean, to be honest, this app, it won't be able to save you a lot, but I think it's really nice to, you know, make an informed decision when you go to the supermarkets. You're not worried the supermarkets might start using it themselves to check out, or do you think they already know what the others are up to? I mean, as far as I can tell, some people told me that they do this kind of thing internally. Yeah, to, like, scribing price from their main competitors. Oh, well, one day, maybe there might be five or six supermarkets. That would be good, wouldn't it? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm kind of keen to add more like a medium or small groceries to my website if that's possible. Yes, and there's the warehouse now too, which are doing a bit of groceries. Yeah, yeah. People say there's a lot to be like adding a warehouse to the least as well. Very good. Well done, Rock. It is excellent work. Rock Wong there who has, just off his own bat, set up grocer.nz, which compares prices from the major supermarkets. It's already proving pretty popular. Quarter to nine. You're listening to Morning Report. Well, China says it's signed an agreement on security cooperation with Solomon Islands, a move which is likely to heighten the concerns of countries in the region. When news of a possible agreement first came to light, New Zealand, Australia and the United States expressed concern it could open the door to a Chinese naval base in the area. With us now, Otago University Professor of Politics and International Studies. Robert Patman, Morena. Marana, Susie. Why do you think this deal has been inked? Sorry, just say it again, please. Why do you think it's been signed? Well, China, since 2019, the Solomon Islands, under its Prime Minister, Manessa, Sogavar, have, they broke ties with Taiwan and they aligned themselves with China. And so in a sense, this is a cumulative result of that realignment that the Solomon Islands has undergone. Also, it should be pointed out for our listeners, that Solomon Islands already has a security pact with Australia. And the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands is at pains to say that it doesn't do it and it's not in conflict with that the existing arrangement it has of Australia but of course that's not how it's seen by Australia, the United States or even New Zealand. Indeed and is there then the possibility of a Chinese naval base as a result? Well the Prime Minister and his foreign minister of the Solomon Islands have point blank directly said no. They said Prime Minister Sagava said recently, quote, there's no intention, unquote, to build a Chinese military base, but, you know, intentions do not always translate into outcome. So I think there's a fair degree of nervousness. Why is there a nervousness? Because of the imbalance in the relationship, China being, you know, the second most powerful country in the world of superpower and the Solomon Islands being a relatively small country. And in a sense, I think people worry that China may be able to use its considerable largesse to establish a military presence in the region. But for Solomon Islands, are they merely taking advantage for their own ends for the benefit of their people of the situation geopolitically? I think that's certainly the argument, Susie. Prime Minister Sagavars said quite pointedly that while the security arrangements for Australia remain in place, the Solomon Islands needs to diversify. That's his word. In the security space. And of course, we in New Zealand always talk about diversifying in terms of economic relations with China. So we will be actually familiar with the idea of a smaller actor, trying to make sure they haven't placed all their eggs in one basket. So that's the argument coming out of Solomon Island, that this is just simply part of the attempt by a small country to maximize the amount of external support it can get. The US, I understand, sending a high-level delegation to Solomon Islands this week, but seemingly, of course, that will come too late for this agreement. How is the US likely to react, and indeed New Zealand and Australia, who voiced concerns about this when it was in the running? Well, they've repeatedly expressed their concerns, and the Biden administration is, as you just indicated, sending a high-level delegation led by Dr. Kirk Campbell, someone on the National Security Council, has responsible for the Indo-Pacific. And I don't think, therefore, use the phrase, it's too late. Well, technically, the agreement has apparently been initial, but it remains very vague. So the US delegation may well see the opportunity to narrow down or influence the agreement that's been vaguely agreed with between the Solomon Islands and China. In other words, they may be seeking to specify the language a bit more and remind Solomon Islands the longstanding relationship with the United States. But it's no doubt about it. I think this is a bit of a shock for New Zealand, Australia and the US. Those three countries have been the dominant external players in the Pacific Islands region. And, you know, this is, if you like, an indication of China's growing presence on the international stage. Thank you very much for talking us through that. Robert Patman there, Professor of Politics and International Studies at Otago University, 10 to 9. And that is time to catch up with Lynn Freeman now, with what's coming up on 9 to noon. Hi, Hyland. Hi, Karen. First of all, we're looking at travel insurance in this brave new world of us post-COVID. If COVID strikes, you're overseas, what will you be covered for? What won't you be covered for? What do you need to think about? So you may well have some questions for our guests. Be listening, that's at 9 o'clock. Also, we're looking at new rules soon to pass into law that will give more protection to people who own apartments or are looking to buy one. For example, it's going to strengthen the regulation of body corporate committees but do the changes go anywhere near far enough to reassure people concerned about the intricacies of these kinds of deals? And after 10, screenwriter and novelist Delia Efron she's known the highs of Hollywood's success but she's also face the death of her partner and her sister from cancer, diagnosed with cancer then herself. She's written a memoir left on 10th, a second chance at life. Very upbeat, I must say, too. That's after 10. Excellent. Thank you very much, Lynn, Lynn Freeman there with 9 to noon coming up shortly. Now, official Anzac commemorations will once again be held at Gallipoli in Turkey. Two previous commemorations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Defence force personnel from both New Zealand and Australia will take part in Anzac Day services on the peninsula, leading the New Zealand delegation as the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Mecafaitari, who joins us now. Tena-a-que, Corin. This is pretty exciting to get back there. How big will this delegation be? So, approximately 30 personnel from the New Zealand Defence Force will be joining myself in a small delegation from my office. Obviously, our ambassador in Turkey, of course, the number of Australians that will be there. But, Corin like, many blue-blooded or red-blooded Kiwis around the globe, hearing the news that we're returning to Galluply or attract many to travel to participate in is what's become a very important event. Well, I was going to ask you about that. So are you encouraging New Zealanders from around Europe who often have in the past to make that sort of pilgrimage to the Anzac Day commemorations? So once the Turkey officials authorise us our returning to Gallipoli, then obviously the message has gone wide and I expect that there will be some Kiwis and Australians who will travel to Turkey, Corrin, to participate in this commemoration. Well, two things. Firstly on COVID, will there be COVID issues, restrictions that they need to think about? So obviously we've gone through the proper channels calling for us to return to the peninsula and that's through the Turkish officials so they have given us the green light hence our return and of course we'll be following all local health protocols insofar as COVID is returned but as far as COVID's concerned but I think it's just the fact that we are returning after two years absence, I think, is going to be exciting. And I guess special. Absolutely. I mean, there's also issues around security in terms of, obviously, near the Syria and the ISIS issue was one that had to be confronted in past years. Is there still travel advisories in that regard? So we're obviously through the hands of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs take advice daily on security and, of course, health concerns. They continue to work with Turkish officials, and so far we've been given the green light, and so our delegation will be departing tomorrow. Finally, will there be any sort of special focus for this particular commemoration in terms of themes or speeches or music and that sort of thing? So obviously it's a five-day visit, Corrin. It's my first to Turkey. I'm doing a battle site visit on the 22nd. I'm also participating in international commemoration, so a lot of allied forces also fought in Gilapli, as well as our own NAC services on the 25th. But when the Glii celebrations are over, then I will return back to E-Symbol to host the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise event, meeting with our New Zealand companies, and support them in the message that New Zealand is open for business. Kiyura, thank you very much for that. That is the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Mecca Faitari. It is six minutes tonight. Well, the orange light setting has brought a sense of relief for parents, as the eased restrictions mean one less thing to juggle. But some COVID-related worries are still lurking. Our reporter Somiya Bamami Dipati, went to Avalon Park to chat to parents and caregivers on the first day of the school holidays. Lower Hutt's biggest playground is buzzing as the school holidays begin under the COVID-orange traffic light setting. While it seems little has changed in parents' day-to-day lives, this mum says there's definitely a small sense of relief. You feel a little bit less cautious, I guess, if the government's making things a bit relaxed. It's eases, I don't know, the anxiety that you might feel around you're mixing together. Another mum, Rachel, agrees. Her son is on immunosuppressants, which means his lungs could be affected if he catches COVID. Despite this, 10-year-old Magnus is confident about the eased restrictions. Most people, when they get the COVID, after they have vaccines, they get only a little cold or something like that. And I have already had my second jab. I had it last year. Meanwhile, his youngest sister, 8-year-old Lilith, says she's glad she won't have to wear a mask at school next term. I have had a lot of big feelings when I went to school. And I think it will really help me that everyone can speak clearly to me. It makes my life a lot easier. For Rachel, the orange setting reflects her attempts to keep a balanced perspective. We take our immunosuppressants and those are good for us to protect our body, but then we also we play in the dirt, we play with our friends, we get out there and we live our lives. It really is a day-to-day balance of keeping all the parts of ourselves healthy and that's our heart and our mind as well. Across the park, six-year-old Sophia and her dad, Carl, both no children have had the virus. They say, while it's great the rules have relaxed, it's important to continue using good judgment. My school friend caught COVID. Yep, in previous with Delta, it wasn't affecting youngsters, but Omicron seems to be affecting the youngsters now. So, unfortunately, we don't know what's going to happen and if five and six year olds and four year olds can now get it I'm not going to drop my guard this mum becker is keen on anything to get the kids outdoors and hers are particularly looking forward to the pools go to Maidstone park you know get in the fresh year but yeah swimming something we haven't done for a while. Because you had to book in times, apparently, through the settings. So we're going to try and do that. Parents remaining cautious, but optimistic, in this new stage of the pandemic response. It is three minutes to nine. Many passengers on flights in the US have breathed a deep sigh of relief without a mask. After mandates on public transport were dropped, here's the moment the rollback was announced on board a flight from New York City to San Francisco. That the Transportation Security Administration will no longer enforce a federal mandate requiring masks in all U.S. airports and on board aircraft. With us now a correspondent in New York, Sarah Walton. Sarah, Kyora, thanks for being with us. Some major airlines have taken this step, and I see on social media it's being announced in midair. That's right. There was reactions like you heard just there that cheering as the announcement came through that the ruling had been overturned. The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, their mask mandate that covered public transport had been overturned. But I think it's probably fair to say there's been a bit of a mixed response overall. Now, airlines can actually set their own rules because they are private companies, but the overturning of the mask mandate prompted a large number of them to scrap their personal mask mandates. So Delta, American, Southwest, just some of those that lifted it. The TSA, which is the, they're the airports and border security agents. They're also no longer going to enforce mask wearing in airports. After that, companies like Uber and Lyft say they too are no longer going to ask their passengers to put a mask on when they get inside. But it's not universal now. Here in New York, for example, where I am, the MTA, which runs the subways, buses, regional trains. They say that their mask mandate is going to stay in place. And that is because there is concern over rising rates of COVID-19 again in many parts of the US, including here in New York. We've just had an increase in our threat level. It's gone up to medium. That's because of this new Omicron variant, BA2. This is going to potentially become quite a confusing picture. Thank you very much. Sarah Walton there, our correspondence in the United States, talking about that mask mandate being dropped on some forms of public transport. That's us for the day. Keep I do it.
