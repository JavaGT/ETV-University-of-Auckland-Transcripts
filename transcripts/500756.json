Kia old and Melissa, thank you. Yes, we've all been there. Court off guard driving down a bus lane and only realizing when it's too late. And one very short stretch of road in particular is catching motorists out to the tune of $12,000 a day. 160 metres may not seem like a long stretch of road, but it's a big earner for Auckland transport. That's because this bus lane in Newmarket reportedly generated $4.3 million in fines last year alone. Yep, that's 27,000 fines of $150, equalling around $12,000 a day. So how do you make sure you don't get caught out? And is it time the rules changed? For more on this, we're joined by AA policy director, Martin Glynn. Martin, thanks for joining us tonight. Why are so many people being fined? Are the rules a little bit confusing? It's a very tricky intersection, sart it? I mean, the rules itself is pretty straightforward. It's hard, 50 metres isn't much for motorists to judge, but where we're talking about in Khyber past, as it approaches Newmarket, there's very little space after the bus lanes for motorists to get into the correct lane if they want to turn left. We think that's the main issue. Martin Auckland Transport has defended the fines as enforcing the law and encouraging public transport use. But are the fines actually working? Well, clearly they're not working if so many people are getting caught out. AT has time and again said it's about compliance rather than revenue gathering and if that's the case we think it really needs to take a look at this bus lane and see what it can do to help motorists to comply. Martin is this a nationwide problem and what do you think needs to happen? It's certainly a problem in Auckland and it's going to become an increasing problem as we see more bus lanes around the country. There has been public education in the past. The issue seems to often be when a new bus lane pops up, or one that's in a particularly tricky location like this one, makes it really difficult to comply. So we think there needs to be ongoing education about it. And what is your advice for people who've been pinged for being in a bus lane? Well, they can apply online to have a, you know, look at their ticket. Usually AT can actually provide the image as well. But if they've infringed when the bus lanes in operating hours, then there's probably not much chance of AT waiving it. Yeah, it's a case of stiff cheese. All right, thank you so much, Munn. You're welcome. ASB in 7 Sharp Keeping you one step ahead Yes it really sucks doesn't it $12,000 a day and fines That is a massive figure But I've actually got a little secret tip A little secret tip for going in the bus lane Without getting fined Tell us Catch the bus Simple, right? Simple, stupid Right with the board is finally open again Many of us are preparing to take off around the world, either for a short trip or the big OE. But with the pandemic ruining everyone's travel plans for the last two years, do we even remember how to fly? Kiwis have been grounded for more than two years. Now with the border's reopening, many of us will finally leave the nest. But with the lack of practice due to COVID, do we need to go back to travel basics? Is it as simple as just renewing your passport? And what about travel insurance? Just how much more do we have to do to get to here? And for more, we're joined by the man behind those videos. Travel influencer Logan Dog, great to have you with us. It has been a long time between trips. And for many, it's their delayed first OE. So what are some key travel tips that Kiwis may have forgotten during COVID? I think no doubt everyone's got itchy feet to get out and get overseas. So I think the first and foremost and probably most obvious one is checking your passport, making sure that's up to date. And then obviously leaving yourself enough time to get it renewed. But, you know, 2020 is the year of the year. So get out and get involved. When planning an overseas trip, Logan, what's your key piece of advice for a successful holiday? Yeah, of course. I think they're having options, getting a travel agent, that extra bit of admin of fees definitely key at the moment. You know, that cuts all the middlemen out and you can, you know, you don't sit on the phone for hours if need to change. Sort of booking platforms like booking.com, they help out. They've got a lot of free cancellation policies. So we're in the midst of planning our UK trip at the moment. So it looks like everything's booking up fast. So definitely recommend getting on that. Should you plan it fully or leave some room for a bit of spontaneity? Traditionally, a bit of a spontaneous man myself. But it looks like everyone's getting out and getting involved so leave yourself a little bit of wiggle room but just plan key dates and then you let yourself go from there so yeah the year of the yes definitely give yourself those opportunities to be a bit of free spirit and when packing your suitcase ogan are you a folder or a roller? Well that's a tough one I definitely a little bit of an overpacker, so I'm a folder, but I think you should leave yourself a bit more room, I'm a bit of an overpacker, but yeah, leave yourself a bit of room and then, you know, you can always go to Commando if you get cut short. Thanks, Logan. Great tips. No worries, thanks for having me. I'm definitely a roller. You're a roller? Yeah, if it's a long trip. So hang on. It's so much more in. Do you? Yeah, you just roll everything up really small, really tightly. Is that science? Definitely. So a roller as opposed to a folder or a scruncher. Sounds like toilet paper, eh? Yeah, no, no. I, my one tip is always keep your shoes in a bag, a separate bag inside a suitcase. So organised. Yeah, no, it's really organised. For 80 odd years now, we have been pasturing our milk in Alteodor. It's when the milk companies heat our milk up to kill bad bacteria. But it's actually legal to sell raw milk, unpasteurised milk, and those who drink it, swear by it. Julian Lee reports. The New Zealand State Highway is full of curiosities, like the Tehorro Milk Stand, conspicuous for somewhere like the Northern Capiti, specialised Italian-made vending machines dispensing milk, teat-cup lighting. Does it taste better than the supermarket? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it's different. And being in the glass, you know, the plastics. But even more remarkable, it's all raw milk, unpasteurised. We like the raw milk. I think it tastes a lot better than the stuff you get from the supermarket. First and last name and your position here. Stacey Faith, Parano. We're very on faith in pharmacistence. And son. And son. Are you surprised with how successful this has been? Oh, definitely. Bl pharmacistence. And son. And son. Are you surprised with how successful this has been? Oh, definitely. Gron us away. Yeah, we had no clue it was going to be this popular. It's awesome. Quite a lot of countries like Australia, Canada and many states in America don't permit the sale of raw milk. New Zealand does, as long as it's regulated. You get the cream on top that you can either pour out to use as cream or mix it together and have the premium milk. Could you explain the taste difference? Probably a long time since you've had supermarket milk. It's not watery. Yeah, a lot of our customers say, look, by the time we get home, we've already drunk a bottle. Raw milkers claim all sorts of health benefits, relief from diabetes, asthma, allergies, eczema, fever and respiratory infections, some lactose intolerant people say they can actually drink it, because it comes straight from the sheds to the vats a few hundred metres away. These old farmers have been drinking raw milk for, well, forever, haven't they? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Well, I go to the supermarket when you can get it straight from the vat. What do you reckon about the raw milk? Oh, awesome. It's just going to take me right back to do the whole cup of cream milk. You know how to separate it? Yum, yum, yum. Faye Farm Fresh is one of 24 registered raw milk sellers in New Zealand. Straight to the point, you come in and get the freshest milk you can. Yeah, I'm going to grow some now. What's a lie? It's fresh, cold, and you can tell, it's natural. But there's a catch. It's fresh, cold and you can tell is natural. But there's a catch. The Ministry of Primary Industries says between 2014 and 2018 there were 112 cases of illness associated with drinking raw milk. And pasteurising milk basically kills the bugs, and they're the bugs that can be dangerous. So drinking raw milk of itself is relatively risky. But raw milkers say the risk is a load of bull. Regardless, the faiths test their milk anyway. We test for E. coli, total coliforms, Simonella, Listeria, caplabacter, positive staff. They're a reputable, good provider of raw milk. They're doing their very best to make sure it's safe. Do you worry about the health warning or anything like that? No. Have you ever had any health problems or anything like that drinking this stuff? No, no, never. The science suggests overall that any perceived benefits are probably overtaken by the risks. Look at what the definitive science tells you and really think carefully about feeding it to the young, the elderly and the vulnerable because if it goes wrong or go wrong badly. Of course, it's all sort of moot in a way. You can just pasteurise milk at home if you're worried. That's just 70 degrees at one minute to boil on the stove. You can get most of the benefits of raw milk, but doing that sort of heat treatment will reduce those bacteria and the bugs in your milk. Otherwise, the red shed on the side of the road with the fibreglass cow on top will continue to dispense its dairy delicacy almost straight from the other. The way, at least some insist, it was always meant to be. Delicious. Coming up on 7-Sharp, find out if two comedians really could be the perfect solution for the shortage of housekeeping staff.

We've all got a little too much on our plate Who said a roast Can't be a pre-cooked chook You're welcome It's okay to have breakfast for dinner And if it doesn't turn out like the picture on the recipe No biggie All right Because whether you want to make it or fake it, it's all good. Because at New World, there's always something cooking. I wasn't actually invited. Oh no. No, you know. What's your name again? If I won Powerball, I'd get a yacht for our fishing trips. Nice.

Mercedes Strutt wants all children to reach their potential. So she's helping provide one-on-one attention for those who, as she puts it, have unmet needs at school. Her charity, Mentor Ed, came about after watching some of the children she fostered struggle with learning. It now operates in six schools in Palmerston North and her dream is to take it nationwide. For her dedication, Mercedes is this week's ASB's good as gold recipient. Mercedes is a very warm person. Mercedes is a very caring, compassionate, loving, just all about other people. In 2017 she started a charitable trust called Mentor Ed, where volunteers go into schools and work one-on-one with children. Usually the lower-decile schools who maybe don't have enough funding for more teacher aids and things like that. She sees the potential on every child. These children can thrive. These children are more than capable of being amazing human beings because they already are. She's got a heart of gold, you know. This is called ASV Good as Gold Award. Her heart is pure gold. Like she's the most compassionate person you'll ever meet. He deserves it 100%. Mercedes is in this classroom over here with her number one helper, Rocco the dog. Here we go. Mercedes. How are you? Good, thanks. How are you? What's going on here? We're just having a little bit of Rocco reading time. So the kids come and choose a book and sit and read with Rocco, who likes to listen to the stories. I think they quite like Rocco. Oh, yes, they love it. Especially if they're reluctant readers. They'll come and read if the dog's here, you know. So why are we here, Mercedes? I'm not sure. Well, let me tell you, I'm Michael from 7 Sharp, and we've been hearing some really, really lovely stories about you getting alongside the Tamariki of Palmerston North, being a mentor, showing them love, support, and more than anything else, just good old passion friendship. Yes. And for that reason, Mercedes, I'm delighted to tell you that you are this week's ASB Good as Gold Reciprociful. Oh, that's so lovely. So the ASB would love to give you $10,000 in recognition of all the work you do, all the voluntary work you do. Wow, that's amazing. And we're thinking maybe $5,000 for your charity. Yes, most definitely. And how about $5,000 for your charity. Yes, most definitely. And how about $5,000 for you and the family? Oh, my goodness. To go and have a little bit of a splurge. Oh, that's wonderful. It's just such a lovely surprise. I mean, the work itself is rewarding, but that makes it really extra exciting. And I think even Rocco's got a smile on us yes he'll be very happy about extra dog treatment what drives me is the joy I see when I come into schools with or without our therapy dog and the delight on the kids faces it fills my cup every day there's genuine cut-thruh oh most definitely or without our therapy dog and the delight on the kids' faces. It fills my cup every day. There's genuine cut through. Oh, most definitely. It's all about feeling supported, building their self-esteem, knowing that somebody's there to listen and be their biggest champion. Having the time shows that you care. Yes, yes, yes, because everybody's too busy these days and teachers have got so much pressure on them and they've got so many kids in the class and so if the community can come on board and help alleviate some of that pressure in a collaborative way, what's not to like? When your head hits the pillow at night, what do you think? Oh, I feel quite exhausted but also happy. The curly black one is like a magnet. Yeah, it is indeed, isn't he? They come running. They just come running. In relation to the money, what are you thinking? I'm thinking that I would like it all to go to the trust. We can do masses with it, and it changes lives what we do. Well, shall we make the executive decision? Yes, if that's okay. Talk to the trust. Great. Thank you. If you know a deserving New Zealander, nominate them at ASBgoodasgold.com.N.Z. She definitely deserved that. An amazing woman and an amazing dog as well. That was cute. With a wave of international travelers hitting our shores, hotel workers are in short supply. But never fear.

It is more than enough pillows for me. So like three, four, five, six, seven pillows on the bed. Seven pallets for two people? We make our bed with three sheets. The way we place our telephone, the TV remote. We have four color coded clothes. We got red, red for the toilet area. Green is for dusting, blue for the mirror, and the yellow one is for our dishes. Do you know that your cloths are the same color as the wiggles? Yes. Yes. Yes. When you finish, you go. Oh, we don't do that. Alright, Mineta, I'm ready to get started. Show me the room.

All right, come on in. So sweaty. Yeah, you are sweaty. I can see that. Hospitality corner is not done. What's this? Come have a look at the sink. And I managed to do it all with one cloth. Okay, that's kind of not good. What should I do with the glasses? Should we rinse properly and then dried with a yellow microfiber cloth? All right, out of ten. What do we think? Out of 10. Probably two out of 10. Okay, here we go. Room number me. What do you think? First impressions? Speechless. This is not the setup for our pillows. Oh, okay. Why does he put about a creative flair? Just say it, it's a dog's breakfast. Nice and clean. Yes, that's right. Just used hot water. Yes. Good job. What do you call this? I didn't know how to dry them. I just kind of improvised, you know? Not good? Not good. Improft skills, like you. Okay, Melita, out of ten, what do I get? Two and a half out of ten. You can't be crap. Two and a half out of ten.
