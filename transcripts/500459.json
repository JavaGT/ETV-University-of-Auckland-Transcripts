Please come close if you like to. I had a smaller room yesterday so I feel like I don't know what happened we've been put in a big room so thank you very much for coming. Now the title's a little bit different from what it said in the program but it's still the same talk. I've been doing some work looking at a new 21st century school and so I'm going to use that as an example of some of the challenges, some of the problems involved in the whole 21st century vision idea. So since the theme of the conference was to be disobedient, we can be disobedient in this room, I feel, and perhaps question some of the aspirational ideas that lie behind the 21st century literature. It seems to me at the moment most of it is aspirational, great ideas, interesting ideas, searching for solutions to education's problems, but there's little empirical evidence to suggest that what we're suggesting even in New Zealand will work. So I think we need to perhaps just take the foot off the accelerator for a moment and consider a number of issues that it seems to me and another of other people working in this area are lying behind the 21st century idea. So we can have some disdemeanent discussion in here. This is the plan of the talk. We've got lots of time, so I'd appreciate anyone interrupting and questioning and seeking clarification as we go. Yesterday we had some really good side discussions about the issues, so please feel free to do that. You'll have to speak loudly if you're at the back. So I'm going to frame the talk with this an idea of three futures. Actually one of them is really the past, but we'll call it Future One. And I'll explain future one in a minute. It's about the old days and the gradgrind image of education from the past. I don't know if you're familiar with. Mr. Gradgrind, anyone know who I'm talking about? No. It's a character in hard times by Charles Dickens, and we're going to watch a little extract for Mr. Gradgrind in a minute. Sometimes if people talk about a gradgrind approach to education, they're thinking about Mr. Gradgrind from Charles Dickens. You'll see what I mean in a minute. Future 2 is where we are at the moment. And Future 3 is a big question. Where should we go in the future? So I just use that idea to frame the talk. Then I'm going to look at some ideas about a model for curriculum design. And we'll look at the current options that appear to be open for the future. One we're probably quite familiar with, but we'll look at the current options that appear to be open for the future. One we're probably quite familiar with, but we'll look at it in a bit of detail, is the 21st century learning design type, as espoused in this document here, which many of you may know, supporting future-oriented learning and teaching in New Zealand perspective, a report to the Ministry of Education by Rachel Bollsted and Jane Gilbert and a lot of other people, which is an important document guiding many innovations in the sector. So we'll compare that with something I'm going to call a progressive knowledge design type, which is a little bit different from the 21st century one. And then I'll use some data from the school I've been looking at to highlight the relationship between the models and what's actually happening in the school. So please feel free to interrupt as we go. So I'm going to set up this context by using the three futures so that partway through the talk when I say Future 1, Future 2, Future 3, you'll just know it's a shorthand for a bunch of ideas that we're going to shove together. So let's think about the old days first, the good old days, when everyone knew what was to be taught and everyone knew how to teach it. So, what sort of values are expressed in that image? What do you want to offer a suggestion of what you can... Conformity, thank you, lovely. Sorry? Compliance, conformity, any more C words? Teach a direction. Control. Abedience., imparting knowledge. Someone said yesterday one size fits all, which I thought was a good one, one size fits all. So this is the sort of the negative image we have of education from the past, that it was one size fits all conformity, and the teacher was the font of all knowledge. It's a homogenous group, very good point. No, it's not diverse like we have now. So I'm repeating things people say just so everyone can hear. And, no, that's good. And of course, what other sort of political ideas are lurking behind the image then? If we dig a little deeper into the lack of diversity in that image, who had access to knowledge at that time? Who had access to education? It's probably an old British school. I'm not really sure, actually. But of course, not everyone had access to education. Yeah, there seems to be an assistant teacher. Yes. Yeah. Maybe he's responsible for the cane or something like that. Okay, so we sort of know about the past. Well, here's a little bit from, let's hope this clip will play. So it's the only clip I could find of Mr. Gradgrine in action. So let's see. Now on, children. And in this school, you'll be brought up on it too. Stick to facts, sir. That is your charge here. Girl number 20. Who is that girl? I don't know that girl. Sissy Jube, sir. Sissy is not a name. Don't call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Sicilia. But his father always calls me Sissy, sir. He always did. Then he has no business to do it. Tell him he mustn't. Who is your father? He belongs to horse riding, if you please, sir. We don't want to know anything of the horse riding here. Don't tell us of that. And tell him there must be no more sissy. Give me your definition of a horse. Give me your definition of a horse. Girl number 20 unable to define a horse. Girl number 20 possessed of no facts in reference to one of the commonest of animals. Some boys' definition of a horse. Yours. Quadraped. Grammeneverous. Forty teeth, namely, 24 grinders, four eye teeth and 12 incisors. Sheds coat in spring and in marshy countries sheds hooves too. Hooves hard and requiring to be shot with iron. A horse, sir. Cecilia Jew. Cecilia. Okay. Poor Cecilia. Okay. When you read it in the book, it's sort of seems quite humorous. When you see it depicted, it's sort of not so nice, it's not so pleasant. So what sort of parody or what sort of comment is Dickens trying to make about? This is 19th century, isn't it late 19th century or something? So what sort of things is Dickens was already noticing about his own education system, do you think? Depersonalized and an obsession with facts, just the recall of facts. So let's talk about future one as under-socialized. an obsession with facts, just the recall of facts. So let's talk about future one as under-socialized. It doesn't recognize the individual student. And it's sort of an induction into a sort of closed set of knowledge, as if knowledge is already decided, and someone's decided what knowledge it is and who has access to it. If you like, the traditions that keep things dominant. And the pedagogy is characterized by sort of that one-way transmission. The teacher tells you, you learn it, and you regurgitate it through memorizing and wrote learning. It's sort of like this dreadful horror of transmission. Education is transmission that we now have. We're not allowed to do that anymore. We have to be co-constructors, don't we? So we have to be ingenious about, how are we going to impart this knowledge then if we can't transmit it? It's a good question. I'm transmitting right now. Is that okay, or should I stop? Or are we co-constructing while you sit quietly? I hope so. I hope the little brain cells are working. Yes, filtering. You'll be filtering. Excellent, okay. So there's probably a place for teacher talk, even though it's not fashionable. But yeah, let's move on then. So we don't really want future one. We don't want that back. Even though some people want to go back to the good old days, don't they? I'm not sure they were so good. Okay, well, let's call this now. I should have called it before and now and in the future. But anyway, future two. What's happened in this photo? Completely other one, apart from the fact that it's coloured. What's happened? Sharing, dialogue. Sorry, social constructing. I beg your pardon? They're all still white, yes? Could be, yeah, well. Blame the internet for that. Who's... They look engaged, don't they? They look like they're actively doing stuff. Okay, so that suits us, our ideas very well. Who's missing? Okay, the teacher is now sort of not really there because we'd like to do away with ourselves as experts. We're not allowed to call ourselves experts because we're actually co-learners with our students. So the teacher's sort of not really there but hovering perhaps, having set up. I'd like to argue that in some ways this future is over-socialised. It's too obsessed with the student at the centre. And in some ways, it's creating very weak boundaries between what schools were set up for and what society and politicians seem to now be asking schools to do. But I'll talk about that a little bit more. I think it would be true to say that we've got an under specification of knowledge now. It's almost like we were so fearful of future one, we've swung into this future too as a response. And in some ways lots of things have now become un-PC or considered bad, like the teacher as an expert, the teacher transmitting, and leaving schools and teachers free to decide what they're going to teach. I suggest our curriculum is quite empty of indications about what we might teach, which is both a strength and a weakness if you think about it. So the teachers become the facilitator. The teacher has to be learning all the time as well. We're all going to become lifelong learners because that way we can be shifted and shunted around the economy in any way we like to. Okay. But at the same time, we've got funny contradictions coming from the ministry. We're told to be co-constructors and to let the kids be a sort of... What was that? Exploratory, thank you. That's what it is. At the same time, we've got John Hattie breathing down in neck telling us, no, visit learning should be visible. Put your learning outcomes up the front. You know, we have our do-nows, we have our learning outcomes. We're quite explicit about what the kids are supposed to be doing. Aren't those two things contradictory? Perhaps not? Perhaps so. So I think future too is a little muddled at the moment and as a result, naughty things can happen. Okay, so this is a bit of light entertainment to show you if we're not careful how far the student-centered ideology can go. Hello, Mackenzie. Are you ready to retake the exam you failed, as is the right of underachievers all over the state of Texas, under a new and ridiculous state law? I am ready to ace the exam. What is it over? It is over the seven words the class had to memorize for the test you have already taken once before, yesterday. Each of those words has a maximum of three letters each, so, I am sure the studying you've done since you initially failed will make this test cake. Also, prior to the exam, I gave the class the exact answers during our review for which you were present. I'm sorry. During your class, I have been very busy texting my boyfriend, trying to plan the next time we are going to get wasted, and when I get home I've been doing way more important things like watching all of the episodes of Jersey Shore and wishing I was hanging out with Snooki and her friends, instead of having to waste time and school. I see. Do you not realize that you must pass this class in order to pass high school and move on to the real world? I don't care about grades or passing. I plan on becoming a star just like Snooki, which will only require me to know how to dress like a slut and drink like a fish. Do you understand that the chances of that happening are even less likely than the chances of me being able to retire before age 70 with what they are paying me, as a teacher? I can do anything. I can be president of the United States, an astronaut, a lawyer, or a doctor. My parents told me so. Are you calling them liars? If I can be anything, that means I can also be the next snooky. I will be partying all day and all night as soon as I turn 18. No. I am not calling them liars. I am just saying that it might be beneficial for you to graduate from high school first. Having a degree will allow you to get a real job if you cannot be the next snooky right away. Are you saying you don't believe in me? You are a teacher. You are supposed to say only positive things to me. If you don't, I will go tell the principal all sorts of lies about you to get you fired. No, no, no. I just said you might not become the next snooky right away. I do support all of my students in their dreams, but I also try to be honest and help you to be realistic. If we're being realistic, I might as well tell you that if I take the exam, right now, I will probably get a zero on it. If I do, can you just give me the 30 I got the first time? I am sure that I can still get an A in your class, because, my mom said I am a genius. No. I am sorry. The law requires that I must average your two attempts and give you that number as your grade. Well, if I get a 40 on this exam and you average that with my 30, that will make 70, right? No. That is adding. I am talking about averaging. I am sorry. I don't know what you are talking about I have never heard of averaging I am doing the best in your class out of all of my classes with math being my lowest grade well I don't know what else I can do to help you I offer tutoring every day during my lunch period and I stay to tutor two days of the week for two hours each day after school without any compensation. Would you like to come for tutoring before retaking the exam? No. I don't have time for tutoring. I have to go with my friends to the mall, every day after school. During lunch, I am very busy making out with my boyfriend in the hallway. Also, I am a genius, remember? I don't need tutoring. Of course. I forgot. So, what do you want to do, then? I will just keep the 30. I am sure I can raise my grade on the next test. In order to pass the next exam, you must know the information from this one. Also, there is only one more week left in this grading period, so, I cannot guarantee you that that will be enough time for you to raise your grade to passing. I'll pass. Things always go my way. If I do not pass, I will blame it on you for being a mean and horrible teacher. All right. Well, I must rush off to get some lunch. I have my next class in 10 minutes since we talked for so long. I am so glad I skipped eating for this. I love my job. Okay. Do we need to deconstruct that or? It's pretty clear, isn't it? No comment. You probably recognize some things in there, I certainly do. So, that's a bit of humor, but there are elements of truth in there, and I think our future too has certainly moved an alarming way in that direction, in terms of our students-centered, perhaps sometimes at the expense of a sense of objectivity in the world about things that could be true or more true than other things, but that gets off the subject a bit into relativism and stuff, so we're not going to go there today. So what are we going to do about the future? There are a number of options, it seems to us. And I think competencies in project-based learning seem to be sort of leading the popular vote at the moment, with new future schools appearing, future 21st century learning school, sorry, appearing, and a lot of other schools interested in setting up project-based learning and interdisciplinary approaches. So the pace of change, everyone says, is so great that this has got to be the answer, because there are unknown futures. Hmm, unknown futures. Have there always been unknown futures? I'm not sure our grandparents would agree that they haven't seen a great deal of change in the 20th century right up till now, or even my parents. There's been knowledge peripheral, people say, well, there's certainly a lot more information around, and the more information, surely the more critical our students need to be about what knowledge actually is compared to information. They're all connected, apparently, all the time, as we know. Again, what does that mean? Does it make them more intelligent or does it make them more connected? And they're going to be training for ever-changing job prospects, apparently. Well, all these predictions, I wonder if they're going to come true. And they're going to need ever-changing skill sets. Even we're told we need them, we need to become lifelong learners. And apparently the education system hasn't equipped people to be adaptable, creative, and to cope with change, that's us. Are we coping? Are we changing? Are we thinking? Are we creative? Okay, something must have worked for us somewhere along the line. But no doubt it didn't work for most people. Maybe we're in the minority. So the idea of opening up the access and democratizing education is a really important one. The question is how do we go about doing it? So we could personalise the learning, we can get techno-savvy, we want to be creative problem-solvers, adaptable, can work in groups and connect with the real world. Those are things we all want and I think we all agree with. The question is, how are we going to bring that about? How is it actually going to look? So what I want to suggest is that we need to think for a moment about the essence of a curriculum design and what is that schools are really there to do? I think Basil Bernstein, a great sociologist, said schools cannot compensate or education cannot compensate for society. And I think now we are asked to compensate all the time for society. And I'd like to suggest that we've forgotten what the prime purpose of schools is and what it is that schools can offer that no other institution can. And by the end of the talk, I hope you'll realize what I'm suggesting that is. There's one special thing schools can offer that really is not available anywhere else. Actually, we could argue it might be available on the internet, but probably not in the way I'm talking about. So I'll leave that as a secret for later, you know. Okay, so I'm going to start from one major assumption for curriculum design. We need a theory of knowledge because the word is bandied about, usually coupled with skills, but we don't really stop for longer. What is knowledge? And the 21st century model has a new view of knowledge, which will go through in a minute, and I'm suggesting, as it's esp through in a minute, and I'm suggesting as it's espoused in that document and in the documents that that document feeds on, it's under-theorised, I'd like to suggest. I don't think it's a safe one for us to build a new model. So I'm going to suggest a different one that we'd need to start thinking about. So I'm going to suggest we need a theory of knowledge based on curriculum structures, and that sequence is a key factor in this model, and that out of the curriculum structures, out of the theory of knowledge, we create an engaging pedagogy. It seems to me at the moment in New Zealand we're a bit obsessed with pedagogy. It seems to me we're going the other way. We talk about pedagogy all the time. The ministry seems to be obsessed with finding the pedagogies that will engage all learners, priority learners. But no one says, what are you teaching them? Is there a relationship between what you're teaching them and the pedagogy you're going to use to teach them? What is it we want for their brains? What is it we want them to know? If you look through our curriculum, you can't find stuff. It's an under-specified curriculum, isn't it? Which is, as I said before, it's both its strength and its weakness. It means that if you, as a new new teacher don't know what to do, the curriculum will not help you. Where can we go? We've got some other things, haven't we, lurking, that help us that sit beside the curriculum? Can you think of some things? Pardon? In the senior school, we've got our default curriculum, the achievement standards. That tells us a little more. What about in the primary school? Where do we look for things? National standards and other support materials. We can find more as we need it. But there's no sort of big picture. If you compare our curriculum document with the UK version, ours is quite empty. Okay, so what do we need in this model? I'm suggesting we need a theory of knowledge before we have the theory of pedagogy, although they'll be intertwined. So let's think about this model for a moment. I'm not going to try and polarise them, but I'm just going to try and think about the best things in both of them. I'm not interested in saying that one is bad and the other is better, but I don't think we've found the right recipe yet, although a number of schools all around the world are trying different things. I visited a school in Sheffield a couple of weeks ago called the XP School. You might want to look them up. Very interesting, quite similar to the school I've been looking at here in New Zealand. Okay, so I'm trying to identify the distinctive features of each type and to analyze the theory of knowledge or epistemology if you want to get fancy, the fancy term underpinning each type. So let's start with the 21st century one, which if I said is this important document from the report to the Ministry of Education. And its theory of knowledge is drawn from a lot of what we call postmodern writers that say those things that I talked about before. The rate of change is so great. We need to focus on people's competencies and skills, yes? modern writers that say those things that I talked about before, the rate of change is so great. We need to focus on people's competencies and skills, yes? In interdisciplinary ways, we need to start there and think about what they need. I would say that's not a theory of knowledge, it's a theory of something, I'm not quite sure what it is a theory of action. And out of this we've got this idea, you know, from people like Castells and DeLawes and New Zealand Jane Gilbert, who talk about knowledge as a process now. They say knowledge is a process. And it's not knowledge, in fact, some people say knowledge per se is not very important, because it keeps changing all the time. Now I'm not sure that's true. And we got got a lot more information and we do have a lot of knowledge development but I think a lot of the disciplines, a lot of the core fundamental principles in the disciplines change quite slowly actually. They change quite slowly. Thinking of my area of music, so it's very clear in music that the world of music has changed incredibly due to technology but I still music that the world of music has changed incredibly due to technology. But I still argue that the fundamentals of what's considered to be an acceptable or good example of music in various genres is generally accepted. And even though the face of music has changed the fundamentals are still there. There are some things if you know about music like the tonal system of organizing harmony. It's still there. It's like a core. It's changed its shape in many ways but its essential principles remain. And I'd argue that's the same for physics and most subjects have a sort of core. So even though it seems like there's massive change, I think at a deeper level, perhaps not so much. And one of the arguments I'm going to make is there could well be a danger when we head the project way that we weaken the sense of what a discipline is. And we might end up with students who have no core knowledge about those disciplines but a very weak and superficial knowledge about some of them because they've been encouraged to put these disciplines together before they know what the essence of the discipline is first but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself there let's look at this. The key principles here personalised learning is theorised and I'm reading from the document, as a genuine involvement of students in decision making about their learning through a synthesis of their input such as identifying interests as well as what teachers know to be important knowledge. So that's good. There's a balance there, what the kids want, but also what the teachers know to be important knowledge. And we see personalised learning in all sorts of different ways going on, differently in different schools. And it's become a bit of a buzz phrase in the last couple of years, hasn't it, personalising the learning? Okay, so we want to... In fact, I've seen something on the ministry website that says something like, learning should be relevant to students' lives now, not, I can't remember the exact phrase, not stuff from the, irrelevant stuff from the past. I find that an extraordinary statement. We're only going to teach them what they think is relevant to their lives now. How extraordinary. And nothing from the past? I think they should take that off the web straight away. Anyway, the next one, equity, diversity and inclusivity. Very important, of course, in our increasingly diverse society. I think it was, wasn't it Maychen yesterday, talked about where one of the, or the third, did she say, most diverse city and fourth in the world. So this is incredibly important. And it aims at developing deeper links with communities. So there's a more diversified sense of the markers of success than is currently the case. And I think it's a very important statement. So I'll say it again. More diversified sense of the markers of success. So there are going to be multiple ways to be seen as successful. And what that exactly means, I'm not sure. It might mean that to be a musician as successful and Gardner would say, Howard Gardner would say, it's one of the, what are there seven intelligence as he says? Yay, music's one of them. Yay, at long last, we've got something, haven't we? Yes, okay. one of them. Yay, at long last. We've got something, haven't we? Yes, okay. And so on and so on, so on. Different ways of being successful. Again, I'd argue that there are some dangers here in shifting those markers. Are we not obsessed at the moment that everyone, we want everyone to have NCL Level 2, no matter what that means? Let's just give them a credit in whatever it is, and they'll feel good and we'll We want everyone to have NCL Level 2, no matter what that means. Let's just give them a credit in whatever it is, and they'll feel good, and we'll feel good, and Heke-Per-A-Per-to feel good, and everyone will feel good, and we'll have met the quota. We may not have actually given them anything of any value, but we might have met the target. So that's an interesting one. Who decides what's a value, of course? Well, we could spend all day arguing about that. So now the knowledge thing an interesting one. Who decides what's a value of course? Well we could spend all day arguing about that. So now the knowledge thing, next one, using knowledge to develop learning capacity, well that sounds pretty logical, who would disagree? But the theory of knowledge lurking in the document is this one I've suggested about, that I've mentioned, that people see knowledge as a process now. I find it a little bit mystifying, but I'll read it to you. Knowledge is the process of creating new knowledge. It is a product of networks and flows, coming into being through interactions and intersections on a just-in-time basis to solve specific problems as they emerge. Networks and flows, yes, I care. That's that group thing. Sounds to me a lot of this language seems like, maybe it's come from a sort of business model, I'm not really sure. Maybe it means a lot to scientists, I'm not sure it makes a lot of a sense. I think of music, yes, networks and flows. Absolutely, playing chamber music together, playing in a band, writing pop songs. It's all that. Actually, it's the process of creating new knowledge. Yeah, networks and flows. Comes into being interactions and intersections are just in time basis. The just in time, of course, is that it's due next week. Because it's going to be assessed. Okay. So there's this funny idea about knowledge floating around there. Okay. Now, this is fair enough, isn't it? If we think of Mr Gradgrind in the video clip we watched, it's very important that we rethink learners and teachers' roles. And we know we are encouraged by the ministry to be co-learners with our students and to co-construct. And all those things. What else have I said about that? I think that one's pretty clear to us. It's the idea of, of course, learners being involved in the decisions about their learning, being able to, you know, thinking about thinking, metacognition, all those important things, and being actively involved and challenged by the tasks their teachers set them. Now number five is interesting, a development of a culture of continuous learning for us. So this one's really about us and the impediment we may be to the change that the policy seems to want. So you better watch it, you're in trouble. You need to buy into this culture of continuous learning. And Bolstead suggests that all the ideas presented in the principles are open for critique, all these ideas here, she says. But it seems to me there's a bit of an underlying assumption that some form of system changes is required and we need to buy into that otherwise it's not going to happen, because we're still the supposed experts in the system even if we try and pretend we're not, we're co-constructing. So this means the report says that education systems must be designed to incorporate what is known about adult learning and cognitive development. And there's now some projects going on through NSCR looking at how teachers have been responding to these sorts of changes. And there's now some projects going on through NZCR, looking at how teachers have been responding to these sorts of changes. And there's some interesting quotes. Teachers getting so excited about these ideas that they say that if you're not going to buy into them, you should sign out now. That's a bit interesting, isn't it? So if you're not going to buy into them, you're not really the sort of professional we want. And the last one are the new kinds of partnerships and relationships that schools need to create with their communities. That's not only the communities of the parents and students, but nearby businesses, all those sorts of things, connecting with local government perhaps, all sorts of ways, so that schools are no longer siloed from the community so those are the main principles the six main principles and some of the solutions suggested in there are presented as forms of pedagogy and curriculum arrangement. So how can we make those principles a real within a school setting? Okay, so I just want to talk briefly about a different model that I'm just calling the progressive knowledge model because I don't want to get confused. If I call it the knowledge model, what would you think? You'd think it was obsessed with content? What else might you think? Oh, okay. All the answers. Gosh, that would be great, wouldn't it? It also might conjure up images of the gradgrind approach that, you know, there's one set of knowledge and I'm going to give it to you and you're going to have to write it down and memorize it. Well, having said that, memorization is an important part of learning, isn't it? We do have to memorize things, and our brains don't develop if we don't. That's why we learn nursery rhymes and times tables. It's not just because the teacher said. It's because there was some logic, I think, to doing it. Okay, so this model says, actually, let's's start with knowledge and let's try and talk about what knowledge in each discipline is fundamental to that discipline and some scholars have called it powerful knowledge because of that. So if we had to say, okay, you have to tell me, I'm going to put six physicists in a room and six musicians in a room and whatever and say you have to come up with the foundational concepts that you think all kids need to have access to for their sense of that discipline to develop. And the argument goes, if we can give access to that powerful knowledge, it will change students' ways of thinking and give them options for seeing the world differently. And they will develop this key thing that schools can offer, which is the ability to think conceptually, conceptual progression. Okay. So it's progressive in the sense that it says, no, this knowledge is for everybody, and it will help everybody, all priority new ones. We've got a bit of a tendency to water down the hard stuff, to make knowledge equivalents available, to say that, I don't know, a unit standard in picking up litter is of equivalent value to level three physics. Is it really? Pardon? You end up with a clean school. Yeah, clean school would be great. Yeah, okay. But what these questions raise are deep questions about what we value as a society. And this obsession we have with, I think getting a little confused between not wanting to put down the human being and not being able to separate knowledge from the human. So we want to say that the knowledge is equal. The knowledge cannot be equal, but I think our motivation is a sort of moral one. Let's give something of value to these students who struggle because they're as valuable as anybody else. But have we really done that or have we cut them off at the past? Okay, so to explain this one, I need to just give you a little bit of background theory and just to explain where it comes from and to show that there is a theory of knowledge behind this one. So this guy, Dirkheim, really, really important sociologists, considered the father of sociology, if you like. And one of the key insights of his work as an anthropologist and sociologist was he realized and brought to our attention that all cultures, all societies, have differentiated their knowledge. And this differentiation has led to progress and specialization. And he called it a sacred and profane. You're probably familiar with that term and maybe not know where it's come from, but it's come from him. So societies had their sacred knowledge, which was essentially in earlier times their beliefs, actually, and profane knowledge, you know, how to go and get enough food to eat. So our sacred knowledge in the West was religious to start with, and you're probably aware that universities developed out of that sacred tradition, and it was quite well gate kept, if you can say such a thing, by the monks, because the rest of us couldn't read, only the priests could read, so they really had the power to tell us what God's word was, because they wrote it down, and we couldn't. But gradually our sacred knowledge has become secularized. It's available now. A form of it is available in schools and another form of it is available in universities and places where knowledge is produced. So this differentiation I think is actually quite important because the knowledge is different. How is the knowledge different? Well, sacred knowledge is structured in systems of concepts. Profane knowledge isn't. It's just a response to a context, like I need to learn how to do up my shoes. I need to learn how to find my way from the Sky City car park to the convention center and find my car again. That's going to be a challenge. That's profane knowledge. But sacred knowledge is something different because it develops in a sequential way through concepts. Now if we don't have access to those concepts, then our learning can become muddled. So that's a really important thing. There are different sorts of knowledge. What we've tried to do lately is to blur this boundary. We've tried to say that social knowledge is just as important as disciplinary knowledge. And we want kids to bring that knowledge to school and we want to celebrate it and we want to give them yet another assignment on their own family and community. I know a little girl at primary school that said, if she was going to scream, if she had to do one more assignment project on her own fun hour and so on. She wanted to find out about ancient Egypt or something. So we can become a little bit obsessed. So this Basil Bernstein, developed Durkheim's ideas, and he really thought more about this differentiation, and he's theorized it very interestingly, into what he calls horizontal knowledge is the profane knowledge and the vertical discourses. He calls them vertical, because they're structured, our disciplines are structured, with some degrees of verticality in them. Like if you want to use, if you want to know about music, there are some basics you find out about. You know, you learn about duration, and then you might learn about how to notate. And there are these steps through the theory of music, and it's the same with maths and science, and even English literature has its own sort of modes of learning and the social the arts and humanities are quite different from the sciences and Bernstein noted that but nevertheless there's a sort of a sequential essence to these disciplines and he calls them internal structures of knowledge they're the internal structures of the knowledge. Or what some people call the episteme. It's the core of how things get put together. Now in maths and physics, for example, we know that you can't get to this step on the ladder if you don't know some of the fundamental ones. And some of the arts you can scoot around sideways and come in later and make it. But in a lot of subjects you can't, and in an under-theorised, underspecified curriculum, this means teachers have to know this, teachers have to be aware of it. So this theory is saying, I think we need to stop and think about this. And the other key point is that these structures will affect the pedagogy. So these structures need to be taken account of. Now Michael Young, it's been to New Zealand a few times. He's just written this book. So if you're interested in these ideas, I suggest future knowledge in the future school by Michael Young. Curriculum and Social Justice as a good read for ideas that contrast a bit with the 21st century vision. Now Michael Young's really interesting. He's developed Bernstein's ideas some more, and he's coined the phrase, powerful knowledge. And what's really interesting about Michael Young is he was the darling of the left movement in the 1970s in the UK, what we call the new sociology of education. In fact, you might have, even if you did some work in educational university, you would have probably come across his work. He wrote a lot about knowledge and power, what he called knowledge of the powerful. That idea that knowledge was kept politically, for political reasons, from many of us in society. Now fascinating, he's now 80 and he's now saying he was wrong. He said he made a mistake. The mistake was that he was unable to see that there was an essence to knowledge that can be separated from people and its political use. The two became conflated, so everyone said, bad, evil, nasty knowledge. It's keeping our kids from succeeding. Nauty knowledge, terrible. Let's focus on pedagogy, and let's have all this new knowledge come into the classroom. And let's even mix them up and do them across disciplines. It won't matter because it's more democratic. He's now saying, big mistake. Actually, there's this thing he's coined the term powerful knowledge. There's some knowledge that is incredibly powerful and that allows students to cross the boundaries into other ways of thinking and to change the prospects of their lives. That's what I was talking about before, these generative concepts in any discipline. So he says we need to start with this knowledge. And we need to make sure we're clear about what it is that we need to teach, and we will shape our pedagogy from that. The other key insight he's given us is this distinction between curriculum and pedagogy because they often get blurred and confused. But if you're really sure about what curriculum is, i.e. the key fundamental knowledge we want all students to have, then we can think about the best pedagogy for that. So, what else have I got on here? So in the 70s, some of the ideas he proliferated and put in writing were things like questioning the very idea of disciplinary knowledge. What can we say about it? What's one obvious criticism we can make of disciplinary knowledge? It is Western, apparently. It's Western. Or is it, if we go that far enough, we discover that lots of our ideas actually came from the east. Is it just Western knowledge? When you hop on that plane and fly, people fly all cultures, many countries around the world, or you see people using their mobile phones in Africa or wherever it is, is that Western knowledge? Or has Western knowledge always been openly available? So there are all sorts of political ideas hiding behind it. He says, no, actually, I think we were wrong. I think this knowledge is human knowledge, and it's universal. It's not always sorted out, but it's available for everyone. Because we've headed in a direction that says cultures have their different knowledges, and they're all equally valuable. The argument here is that our social beliefs are equally valuable, but some knowledge is more powerful than other knowledge. When you think about it, it's absolutely true. Some knowledge is more powerful than other knowledge. It allows things to happen. It's better knowledge. It works. Okay. Okay. So he's having a big rethink, which he thinks is quite interesting. He says more and more we're diluting disciplinary knowledge with the everyday knowledge and personal knowledge. And Bernstein calls this pedagogic populism. We just bring more of the horizontal stuff into the school. Now in music this happens a lot because in music kids already know what's important before they come to our classes because what's important is what they like, as you can imagine. I don't know, does anyone here have this happen in geography or math? The people, students arrive and say, no sir, please don't teach that. That's a dumb thing to teach. We want to do this. We have this problem in music and in the hearts. So we feel this intersection between, if you like, the sacred and profane very strongly, and we've had to question quite deeply what our sacred knowledge is. Should we throw it out the window? Or should we say to these kids, no, you have to learn this stuff because it's good for you. And in five years' time, you'll say, thank you, thank you. But I didn't know at the time. that could well be the case and it's one of the problems we've got how do we make powerful disciplinary knowledge accessible and interesting for students well if we knew how to do that we would we would have won the world so I'm not saying it's a problem that's being solved I think it's still floating around so this argument is we need to start with the knowledge the fundamental I'm not saying it's a problem that's being solved. I think it's still floating around. So this argument is we need to start with the knowledge, the fundamental concepts, and think about how to make them accessible with an engaging pedagogy. So it's nothing like Future One, and it's less like Future 2. Listen to this statement from Michael. He says, we should ask this to start with. Is this curriculum... No, no, he's sorry, he said the current orthodoxy is to say this. Is this curriculum meaningful to my students? Sound familiar? He says, no, what are the meanings that this curriculum gives my students access to? What are the meanings? What will it do for the students? Rather than, is this meaningful to my students? Gosh, if I'd only been taught what was meaningful, what I thought was going to be meaningful to me, I wouldn't be in this room today, that's for sure. I'm glad I came into contact with stuff. I didn't know I was going to be interested in. So that's the danger with the, it's one of the dangers, I think, with the over-socialization of future two. So now I want to... Okay, so you've got a sense of the both models? Does anyone want to ask any questions about those two models? There's a lot in there, and I've talked about a lot. So you want the same thing at the moment. Yeah. Two questions. First one is that the very first thing you show of a traditional English, I presume 1880 or something or other school for the nation, that was what the society at the time required them to do. And if that person tried to teach in what we call a modern day one now, that he would have lost his job without him. And was that an important volunteer? Well, that little nation we got on conflict, but it had the biggest empire probably the other day. Okay, so it worked at the time. And so each time you go through, so now what we're looking at here is a new model, I'm wondering if in the future, you know, long way away like 10 years, people will take the tape of this particular session. We're running now and show up and everyone will roll around laughing in the aisle because it is so no longer what society wants that is so outdated. That is the first question. Do you want to give this? Yeah, that's not any question. How is it not a question? What was the question? The question is, is how do you know that you are not just doing what society wants right now exactly the same as what happened in the past? And we, in and we in fact in fact are just repeating the whole idea of education that they take what society asked you to do it and do it there so what's the change well I like the model I'm presenting isn't what society is asking for what society asking for at the moment in the New Zealand context is a much more student-centred no I don't want to really get into that use of that word, but you know what I mean? There's an over-socialised sense of it. Now, so in terms of will they be laughing in the aisles, they may well be, my point is that we need to have the discussions and put different models up for assessment in the best way that we can, and perhaps trial things. That's all we can do, isn't it? I'm not sure that's a satisfactory answer or not. Second question. Yep. Second question is, if you move away from traditional knowledge, so that perhaps when I was at school, I learned that Robert Dean Lee's horse was on track. And I was at school I learned that Robert Lee's horse was named Trave. And I knew Robert Lee, Robert Lee, you're a friend of mine. Anyway, the, so we did things like that. Now, if you, these days, when you say to a class coming what Robert Lee, they don't know if Robert Lee was or anything else, but they can go to that and Travers got numerous websites of the time, the course, has all the way of through, and they can look it up very quickly. But if you haven't given them the basic knowledge, so you haven't gone through the ideas of Hitler and Pol Pot and things, okay, you pick on one group and discriminate east them, then you have a whole generation who's not prepared to do that. So when the party turns up and says, and you've got a housing crisis, it's all the Chinese hole, and no one says a word, you're in exactly the same situation, and you're all downhill to get smoking back. Yeah. So you have to have that basic knowledge, and do you think you have that basic knowledge put on to people, even though you might say, and look that up at the time I want to on the web, but if it isn't in the back of the brain, it isn't there, then you run a danger that they haven't got the basic stuff in the back of their brain to be able to use for remains in future situations. That's what you're saying. Yes, you're saying that's the same thing. Yes, you're absolutely right. And I think that's exciting is that we don't know what's going to be like in tea is and yes, we could acknowledge that Michael Young is able to say, well I thought there isn't current or more. Actually, that's what we should be in celebrating the race and the fact that we can't. We change. And we've had to be part of all that. And that was up and I really like to do this. Have we not been adapted to? Because you have to say that the means for a man in our schools. We have. Can I add one thing to do about what we're talking about. I think there's a difference between concepts and content. And we need to be sure that in fact what I'm talking about here is actually the concepts. What are the core fundamental deep concepts of a discipline that change very slowly? They can be illustrated with different content, and they will be illustrated by different content as the world changes. So if I want to illustrate a great piece of music, I might choose Michael Jackson, or I might choose Beethoven now. I wouldn't have chosen Michael Jackson 30 years ago, say for example. So the content has changed. But the fundamental principles that allow me to say this is a great piece of music are accepted within the discipline and generally agree to because they get debated. And so we know what they are and we can say. Now you can say that, so as a historian you're saying, what are these key fundamental principles we're working with as a historian? And you will use all that content, which at the next level down is about the name of somebody's horse maybe, because it makes it real. So that's part of it. But I'm talking about here the systems of meaning that gives structure to a discipline. And the essence of my argument is, I might as well jump to it now anyway, is that if we go the project way, an interdisciplinary way, we run the risk of diluting that essence, and it sounds really cool, and it sounds exciting, but what I've seen at the school I've been looking at is that the level of connection between different disciplines will be quite, can be quite superficial. It can end up with one teacher teaching there a bit and then the other teacher teaching there bit. Is that what we mean by interdisciplinarity? Can you really expect kids to be interdisciplinarians when they still don't know what it means to think like a historian? I'm skeptical about it because what's... Tell me what's structuring... What is structuring the approach to knowledge in the 21st century vision? What is giving it coherence and structure? Can anyone tell me? Well, themes are projects, problems? Themes, projects, problems. Inquiry, these are general things. How can we do a good inquiry? How can we investigate a problem really well? What do we have to know deeply? We have to have a discipline to start from, something critical to start from. So it seems to me that we're swung round the other way and we've said, oh, we've swung to pedagogy. We've swung to pedagogy. This is what we should do to make it interesting, but we've forgotten that in fact that might have nothing in it. There's some examples in Rachel Ballstead's research about people making bags for environment conferences. And they questioned these kids at the end. I think it was environmental science or social science. What did you learn about environmental science? Nothing. But we learnt that we could make some bags and sell them at a conference. So we need to be sure what the core content is. Can I leave that for now? Because I want to talk about, don't you want to hear about the school? Do you hear a little bit about the school? So these are the ideas floating around. Now, my argument is that I don't know what the answer is, but what I'm suggesting is, in light of some of this literature, he's onto something here that we need to be careful. We haven't thrown the baby out with the bathwater, and that in fact inquiry, interdisciplinary, all these things, personalised learning, sound democratic, sound wonderful, they appeal to our sense of fairness and rightness. But have we considered what it is that's at the center of what we're trying to teach here? And my argument is that this is what schools can offer. Kids can look up that stuff on the internet, but they will not know what the system of meaning behind it is until they meet you. Because you are the historian. You are the modeled historian. You're the model musician. You are the one that embodies what it is to be these, to be associated with these disciplines. You are the one. Andodies what it is to be these, to be associated with these disciplines. You are the one. And you can't find that. You can find some words, but you can't find it, I don't believe. So, what does school offer? Epistemic assent, that's what it offers, or another fancy word for it conceptual progression. Now, that means moving from lower order to higher order understanding. Vagotsky talked about it. He said, kids come with their everyday knowledge, and the role of the school is to transform what they know about the world by introducing them to scientific knowledge. By scientific, we mean the disciplines. We don't just mean science. He said it. We all worship Vagotsky because he was picked up by the constructivists. But what he meant was, if you read him carefully, construct knowledge to bring this about. This is what schools are for. To bring about the change in the intellectual capacities of students. Now that's not to say that the affective and social elements of the school are not important, because as we know, if they're not in place, this is unlikely to happen. But my argument is this needs to be at the centre of what we're there to do, because this is what cannot happen anywhere else. That's what schools can offer. So I'm arguing conceptual progression should be at the centre of what we do. I say our curriculum doesn't give it to us, the achievement standards hint at it and a lot of us know it tacitly. If we've been well trained in our discipline, we can sort of sort out what conceptual progression means in the various dimensions of our subject. And we probably do it, maybe more or less explicitly. So I'm saying that it needs to be a core component. Now, this new model says knowledge is a process. It's about doing things. Knowledge is not a product. Knowledge is not a sort of thing like a theory or a set of ideas. And we're going to structure the school around lots of projects and modules. Can you see an immediate problem, Ben? Now if you don't agree that conceptual progression is at the call, then you're not going to agree with anything I've said and that's fine. You don't have to. But can you see what the problem might be? The challenge might be for a school that wants to set up a structure based on projects and interdiscipline. I think surely some things are jumping out at you that are going to be a problem. If we think conceptual progression should be one of the central things we're doing. Any of the conclusion of a bit of something to put a lot? A context. Yeah? It could be delusion of a bit of a rub going to think what he is just knowledge and he did and then A bit of a rough going to think what you have trouble. And the other one for kids, who's going to track. That's a need to know what you're going to know that. Lack of coherence is a real one. It's in trouble. And the other one for kids is how you're going to track? Who's going to know? Who's going to know that this student has covered the fundamental concepts in year 9 and 10 science? If they're popping around going off to modular model, this seems to me, this is not to say that this would not work, but there are some extra problems and they're not talked about in the document because I believe that the theory of knowledge is not in the document. So I think there are some problems. Okay, we'd better look at the school. Because I'm going to run out of time. Okay, so this school, I'm going to read a bit, actually, because I followed a student around, and I think it's nice if I just read the little story of that day. So I arrived at the school and was paired up with a boy called Connor, a year nine student, he's age 13. Now at this school when I visited it was in its first year of operation and this year is its second year operation so it's only got year nine and ten cohorts in it. And each day begins with students congregating in their learning hubs and the learning hubs are the therapeutic, or core of the school, I call it. Therapy, we would have called guidance, I suppose. Maybe it's still called guidance, I'm not sure. The aim of the hub is to create a caring environment for small groups of students, up to 15 in each hub as the school grows. Students start each day there with 10 minutes, and there are extended times of up to an hour and a half on three further days. So this amounts to 17% of the curriculum time. The plan is that students will remain in the same hub with the same learning coach all the way through their school time. So it'll be a strong personal guidance connection for them. Now because students can choose from a variety of thematic-based modules of learning, a significant role for the Learning Hub coach is to ensure that the students choose a balanced disciplinary diet. So someone's looking at that as well to say, okay, Susie Lou, you've chosen six models this term and they're all maths. This is not good. You need some English literature or whatever it might be. So the hub is also the site of academic tracking in that sense. Okay, so I was with Connor and we had this nice congregation with his hub family and his learning hub coach and then we moved off down the corridor to his first class which is called Spin. So these are special interest, that's what Spin stands for, and the students choose three per term. And spin is allotted 17% of the time if you work it out of the timetable. Now Connor had chosen three spin classes of the term, and these classes have got wonderful names, so they're not going off to English for science and maths. Okay, so Connor had chosen full flight from beat poets to beat boxing and the apprentice. So those were his spin classes at this time. And on this day I accompanied him to the apprentice. So in this class students were learning about entrepreneurial skills. So what sort of a class might have been labelled in another school? Economics or social studies. And it was, yeah, okay. So they were learning about Richard Branson and Larry Page and they were sort of dissecting what had been what you know what sort of things had made these people very successful so there's an that entrepreneurial thread of the curriculum was running through that particular class that day and then after morning break we went off to another spin oh no sorry I'm I'm mistaken I can't read my own writing we went off to my time. Oh no, sorry, I'm mistaken. I can't read my own writing. We went off to My Time, that's right. So in My Time, student can choose to do something, like work on homework or on particular projects, or they might go and seek out teachers in their different hub areas for advice. And that's 11% of the time. On this particular day, Conner sat down and did some homework. So following my time, we did go back to his second spin, which was full flight. Oops, I've gone too far. We're still in spin, aren't we? So I'll tell you about spin. This was a very, a full flight. This was a very interesting class. This is what the course booklet says about it. So the kids get this course booklet with all these fabulous names on them and there's a description. This was the description for full flight. The science of planes and parachutes, examining the forces that let planes fly and parachutes fall slowly. So Connor was working in a group with two other students and they were working at recognizing key concepts, the principles of flight. So quite high level stuff I think for year nine. They were talking about, they were trying to group the various concepts that they principles of flight. So quite high-level stuff I think for year nine. They were talking about, they were trying to group the various concepts that they'd been given and set up defining them and thinking about the relationship between the concepts. So quite high-level stuff. They were looking at thrust, lift, drag and so on. And they were going to make a design of a flying machine. So project based drawing on science, physics. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Now in the afternoon I experienced a small learning module. Now these are, as you can see, take up 44% of the time. And these are the interdisciplinary modules that two teachers teach. Now when the school first opened they had three teachers, three disciplinary areas together, and they discovered quite quickly it didn't work. And so they moved to two. So look at the titles you can choose from. What would you like to do? Bombs away, the science of delicious. It's about making ice cream. Yeah. The mechanics of me, welcome to the danger zone. Collision course, horror in hotel, I think was about horror genre in English and some design. So what had Connor chosen? Well, he was often, it's not rocket science, which is not listed, but that's because I'm saying it now. And in this one the module was to test by prototyping a propulsion powered product to share by pitching your product and the market's designed it's designed for. So we've got a meshing of what two disciplines here? Economics and science, yeah. Okay, but in this particular class, physics was dominating the curriculum, although there was this thread of managing your resources and marketing your product that was running through it as well. Now, Connor was testing his flying device, and he went outside, and I went with him, he went onto the tennis courts and measured the height of his first flight by measuring it sort of roughly against the basketball hoop. Then I was back inside, and I heard a really interesting discussion between a teacher and a number of students, and they were talking about Newton's laws and how to draw a force diagram. And one student had measured the height of her rocket flight and she said to me she used trigonometry. So I said, where did you acquire this trigonometry knowledge? She said, well, in a maths module. So I thought that was really interesting. There was this nice connecting across the disciplines there for her and she'd used trigonometry in this other module so I was quite impressed about that now the other dimension to the curricular learning is the big projects which everyone's involved in and I think this could be all sorts of things connected to the communities I think one project was thinking about the school in its new environment, connecting with the local council, and they devised a musical drama production. So everyone was involved in some way in that. So that's the structure of the school that I want to share with you. So some initial findings. I'm going to have to go quite quickly through this because we've done a lot of talking, but it's all good. I've dividing up, I've talked to, I think about interviewed nine or ten teachers and a focus group with six students. So, and I've been to the school maybe eight to ten times. So I sort of feel I know them reasonably well, although things change fast in schools as we know. But I'll just share with some initial findings that I've divided up into two main topics. One's the vision, and the others are challenges in curriculum design. Just to quickly show the sorts of things are going on where a school is pretty much trying to... It's not my impression that they use this as some sort of Bible. There are certainly other things going on in the approach, but it's pretty closely modelled on these things. So, what about the vision? Well, I found that the vision is founded on this idea of growth mindset, which some of you might know about with Carol, it's Carol Dweke, say her name, a growth mindset. And the principal told me, and I quote, we appointed our first round of staff, middle leaders, based entirely on mindset and leadership disposition and didn't even look at curriculum coverage. So they wanted the people with the right sort of attitude to cope with this new environment, which of course everyone's interested in watching and seeing how they go. So the mindset was really, really important. So here's also the principles definition of it, which you can read, explanation of it which you can read explanation of it. Okay, great. It's sort of like teaching is often like that. Always was for me, I don't know for you, but most of us are never satisfied and we keep questioning as we keep going. But being in a school like this takes these sort of challenges to a new level. And I think many, as the year progressed, many staff found it quite difficult in some ways. There were tensions arising as in any sort of new school. So trying to look at the data, I sort of some differences across the data from the teachers. So I've utilised a little device developed by some other researchers. Using the descriptors faith stuttering and awkwardness. Now faith means that there's a real correspondence or alignment between the teacher and the vision of the school. Stuttering is where there just seems to be a little bit of a disconnect beginning to happen and the teacher might not even be particularly conscious of it but there's something in the words that they're saying that makes me suspicious and then so faith stuttering awkwardness is where a teacher's clearly saying they're finding some difficulties with the vision and they're not not really sure whether they're buying into it anymore and I saw examples of all those three things in the school. Here's an example of... This is the level of awkwardness, I would say. If you're critical of a particular aspect of the school, I think you are seen as not really buying into it. You don't have a growth mindset. Whereas I would have thought that actually is the very definition of growth mindset, the questioning and the challenging. It's a really interesting statement to make. So we're going to have a growth mindset, but it's got to be the right sort of growth mindset. Otherwise you're in trouble. And this teacher felt that they couldn't particularly speak out because it might have been a context where a teacher may have been arguing for something that was perceived as perhaps a little bit too traditional. So we've got a bit of awkwardness there in relation to the vision of the school. But then again we've got a different teacher who I think noted the difficulties, had problems with it, and has moved back to faith. Moved from faith to stuttering and back again. And as a result of that, this teacher is saying, you know, we're going to have to be open about how we bring other teachers into the vision of this school. And to keep checking on it all the time because managing change is a tricky business. So we've got this sort of difference going on, this faith stuttering and awkwardness all present together, which is what you might expect. I mean, what school is in agreement with itself. But at another level there's something else going on that came out of the literature, which is, sorry, out of the data, that there seem to be a tension for some teachers between their disciplinary identities, their sense of, you know what I talked about before, being a historian or being an English teacher or whatever it is, and at times in tension with the vision, because the vision is very much about, what is the vision about? It's about the student, actually, very much about the student and the structures that have been put in place to empower students. And some teachers felt that it was sometimes in tension with perhaps what I've argued, though these are not the words of the teachers, but access to powerful knowledge is what I'm talking about. Is there enough and is it clear enough? And do the kids have a sense of where they're going? Some of the kids told me in the interviews they were a bit worried. They didn't have a sense of, they had a sense of fragmentation at times about, not all of them did but some of them did. Okay, so those are the key things I wanted to share on the vision. So it's interesting for a new school to be working through those issues and how it will go. But at a more concrete level, perhaps the challenges in the curriculum design process also very interesting. Yeah, sure. I'm going to keep what I say because some of their staff are at the hitting distance off me. Oh, really? Oh, really? And they are brilliant staff and things the eye have absolutely no doubt about that. I know some of them and that thing. But you've missed out, you haven't had any stage questions to the parent and what they think, and the parents in many cases is a major influence on who goes to what schools. And you still have the parents clamouring to get into traditional schools like grammar and far less choosing to go to our tender schools. I agree with you that we're getting this is a great design and it's a really modern thinking etc. But inside your asking how is this going and this of this do you think you should have consulted the parent as well? That's not my question. It's not my recent question, no. But it's peripheral to what I do. What I'm looking at is the curriculum design and is conceptual progression present in what I see. That's my real focus. But I'm sharing with you some of the contextual stuff. Of course. May not succeed unless the parents take into account. That's possibly true. No, I think you're right. But it's not my focus here. So, yes, of course the parents have to buy into it, otherwise they're going to take their kids away. And parents are often not so well informed, so the school needs to connect as the document says, to connect in many ways with its community. That might be one of the key ways to connect versus what are we actually doing here and what's guiding us in making these decisions. So this is the principle again. Just read that. You'll be familiar with the ideas I've said before. So the principle's not so keen on the separate disciplines, but we saw in the structures before, some of the classes are more discipline-centred and some are not. So that obviously is having an effect on how things are. So how are things organised? Well, if they're not organised around disciplines, then they'll... But things are linked to the curriculum, of course. Teachers are working really hard to link things to the curriculum. And as the school moves towards NCA next year, the achievement standards will have their impact as well. But really, I would describe it as the curriculum is really organized through themes or external organizers. Now why do I call them external? Because they're external to the knowledge. They're not internal to the knowledge. They're external. They're a problem or an idea or a theme. And my argument is that's interesting, but does it give us the coherence and the internal structure to the learning that we need? I suspect it doesn't, but I'm not sure. Hi, Glenn. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I do work in store and if I do as learning to life on. Just in response to that last point, those are fully intrinsic to knowledge because we deconstructed the curriculum and we have done a huge mass work around our knowledge, pulling out key to fresh our concepts and skills and the future scheme. And the way we chose those things to work likely whether they were concepts that are cleared in this, the very and the community and pretty much. That's where we've got their own reviews those excuse me per term over the first eight terms of the first two years they were all like we were born to the concept of and they didn't make the big common thing unless they were in the next three learning here it so for example another one will start there is relationships which in english and scientists and maths in English and science and mathematics and science and everything we've called those concepts in the music they're going branch of concepts so we've both all the conceptual understanding across the discipline and we actually worked really hard to build conceptual progression that's my absolute drawing before so it's interesting yeah what you want to when you heard and certainly can't you but I don't show you some of that kind of the same but I'm surprised if you're used to that at the cost yeah well it's still in the very system yeah um well I would still But I'd surprise if you can't see that at the process. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's still in the process. Yeah. Well, I would still argue that such things are not sufficient. They don't give us any sense of what the concepts or the progression is going to be. So it's at the next level that it gets fleshed out, isn't it? And that's the important bit. And I would say our curriculum doesn't particularly help us, so teachers are going to have to do it. And if you're lucky enough to have a staff with very highly trained in school teachers, you'll do it. But I think a lot of work needs to be done and what that really means in each subject and what the conceptual progression is going to be. But this is another comment from the principal, what's trying to be done in this school is innovative. And his argument here is that, well, are you asking other schools if they do it? Now in other schools in more traditional structures, some of these things are tacit and they're sort of in the structures themselves. Like you move from year 9 to year 10 to 11, there's something happening there in year nine maths and then year 10 maths and so on. But in the project-based model, the challenges are greater, aren't they? So what the school has shown me is that a great deal of extra work has to be done to figure these things out, including how to report that to students and parents. How are you going to report this? And the school has struggled with that. And it's interesting that that's the learning design model, which is a cool global model, but it tells us nothing about actually what kids are going to learn, in my opinion. This is a model based on process. It's all about things that kids are going to do. But it doesn't give us any tangible content there. Of course it's got to be linked. This is the overriding thing and you link that to the curriculum. Specificity, I'm sure. I found it interesting by the middle of the year there still wasn't a unified and meaningful tracking system that had been developed, suggesting that the priorities had laid with the vision more than some of these more sort of concrete things. And I know that the school has made a lot of headway into finding a more meaningful reporting system. And this is what one teacher said about the interdisciplinary approach. So again, I think this points to this problem that it is a much deeper issue to try and put subjects together than it appears. I think it would be challenging for highly trained professors in a particular discipline to really sort out how disciplines would meaningfully connect. I certainly find it hard. So there's a danger in the rush to make this terrifically appealing and accessible. My argument is that we need to be careful that those foundational core concepts are still kept an eye on and kept in check. So what's the future three going to be? Well, ideally I'd like to see a combination. I'd like to see knowledge much more explicit and clearly at the centre because I think that is actually the most powerful things schools can offer students. That's my personal opinion and I think it's backed up by a lot of philosophical thought anyway. But perhaps one point we should notice, we don't know if the school's going to work. We don't know if other 21st century schools are going to work. It seems to me there's very little empirical evidence out there. And of course, educational research is a fraught area because how do we know if something worked, why it worked? The variables are so incredible and so various that it's very hard to pin anything down. So I just leave you with that thought at this stage that perhaps we need to be careful about where knowledge and foundational disciplinary knowledge in particular sits in the whole picture and my argument would be there isn't a theory of knowledge in particular sits in the whole picture and my argument would be there isn't a theory of knowledge in you can disagree with me that's fine this is just my presentation there isn't a theory of knowledge in the 21st century vision there's no no fear of how the knowledge is constituted I think that's why we need to bring in the epistemology ideas, marry them with the 21st century vision. But it will be interesting to see how the school progresses as they move towards the increasing specialisation of required of NCAA. I guess that will be really, really interesting. Okay, so thank you very much."}
