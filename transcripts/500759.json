He hoking for some of the black who, after the arotake new to the team and the re-hainatang of the cari-a-e any environment that has to go through something like this, it's not easy. I feel for him, you know, we had a good connection, good relationship, and for me, just to know that the team is probably going to be doing something like this, it's not easy. I feel for him.

There's 21 girls who want to make the play, the whole of the year that's the whole people that get named and unfortunately not everyone gets to go so when we're out there you're fighting for a spot every single day which is pretty tough at times obviously it's not easy we're bloody competitive we have people five people in one position we're all fighting for it and we're going to put our hand up for the coach as much as we can. We love each other, love, hate each other on the field. But when you're coming into the environment, you're 19, 18 and you hear two of our leaders scrapping on the field because someone's off-side or someone's that are high-tackle, that's just a pure competitiveness and I think that's what makes us great.

Now you can keep fit while you sit with Cubie, the world's leading compact, seated elliptical. Cubie gives you active sitting, letting you burn calories and keep moving in an easy and low-impact way. All while you work, read, or watch TV.

Qube was named a top 10 gift by Time Magazine and has been featured all over the world with thousands of five-star reviews. My QB for me and my family has been a game changer. I feel young again. Qube is a lifesaver for me. Cuby has developed a unique patented technology that fits anywhere. It's Whisper Quiet while it works more than half your body's muscle groups.

The low impact can assist your rehab or physical therapy and keeps you moving for better health. And you can monitor your progress, see your strides, calories burned, and duration of use, or turn up the resistance. And it's perfect if you're just starting on your quest to revitalize, suffer from joint pain, mobility issues, or just want to burn extra calories while comfortably sitting. The QB is awesome to me.
