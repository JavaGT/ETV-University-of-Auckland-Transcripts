I think that's important to know that sometimes students actually don't know why they've come to you. Sometimes they just know that internally something's not right, but they don't necessarily understand it themselves. If someone has a broken leg, usually it's really obvious what's wrong but if someone has a mental illness it can be much more confusing with the person so it's really important to just bear with them and if it takes them three four ten fifteen attempts to get it it's okay.
