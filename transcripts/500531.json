Do you think that you would be able to turn the patrol car on and make it run. You could. Okay. Do you think that you would be able to turn the patrol car on, make it run and maybe drive down the road a wee bit? You would. But what is the age for driving a car in New Zealand legally? How old do you have to be? It is 16. So why? Why is it that the law says you have to be 16 before you can drive a car? What's some reasons why? You might not be mature enough? Mature enough.

You can probably hop onto any application or download an application like Facebook and you could make it work really well, couldn't you? You could probably actually make it work a lot better than someone who's older like me because you're very tech savvy. But they have age limits on those applications so that the people that are using them can use them safely. They have the skills and the maturity to keep themselves safe using them and if something did happen where they become unsafe, they would know what to do or where to go to get help to keep themselves safe. So that's the reason why they actually have those age limits on those applications. But the really important thing is if you are using them that your parents know, they give you permission and they can actually help keep you safe while you're using them. Does that answer your question? Yeah. Perfect."}
