Thank you very much for joining us and of course thanks to our partners chorus. course, good morning, Ryan. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, good morning everybody. Friday, short week. And a long weekend to boot. Now this morning, I actually, we just had Tia on the program. Lovely Tia, who is going to be our reporter in Wellington. So we're very excited. Tia's going to be moving to Wellington. And this morning I ran into the newsroom to get some footage for something and I said, I thought it was Tia, who was sitting down in the newsroom. Oh no. And I said, Tia, have we got that footage from Japan? And she said, she sort of looked at me and I thought, that's odd, she seems a bit off this morning. Mistaken identity. Yeah, um, Jasmine, I believe? Oh, Jasmine. Lovely........ This Jasmine. So I was informed about this afterwards Jasmine I'm sorry. The thing is they're both absolutely beautiful they both have long dark here and they were wearing masks. This is the thing it's a mask issue is it not? It's the mask thing that creates so much confusion. Well we can blame it on the mask but sometimes it's eyesight as well. I remember walking, I had a previous job to the lift and it was in the morning and someone was walking along and I thought it was a friend, you know, a colleague that I knew, so I was standing at the left. Hey good morning, hi! And they kept coming to the lift and then they stood there and I thought I don't know who this person is, so we stood in silence awkwardly next to each other like, oh that was awkward. I've done that down the street where I saw a guy who, like white wear ads or I don't know was one you know chain store, hey and he blinked me complete another road and it wasn't complete another road and it wasn't until I got to the car thought oh my lord that guy doesn't know me from Adam, he's on the telly, he's on the tally, yeah he probably, he's, he. At least you're only waving. I mean there is nothing worse. No I waved and gave it the old hype. I think there's a big old response. But there's nothing worse than when you go, you know, when you're in the office or you're at a party or something, you go up and you know, slap your friend on the bum and only to find out, it a correct. Literally. All right, what are we doing? We've got a lot on the show today, by the way. We are all over the place. The Johnny Depp trial, as you know, the case that's going on, we're going to get an update on that. We are obviously going to talk to some veterans today because it's Anzac Day on Monday. Hents the Poppies. fun today. William is out with a bit of Dancing with the Stars preview so look out for that. Of course he's our resident expert isn't he? He is indeed. Right it is six o'clock coming up on the show this morning. We're experiencing the highest inflation the last 30 years and it looks like the worst is yet to come. Can we keep blaming international factors? Labour Minister David Parker and Nationals Deputy Nicola Willis debate this at 10 past 7. New Zealand is negotiating an information sharing agreement with Japan for closer ties over security issues. So what will China make of this? International Relations Expert Robert Patton is with us at 20 past 7. And as we've just discussed, the Johnny Deat trial is getting ugly with claims of drug use and abuse. U.S. correspondent Sam Rubin is following the cases with us in 10 minutes. And later this hour we talk to a man who's turning 102 today. We join him to celebrate. That's just before 7. It's time for the news. At muddy, it is 6 o'clock. Flash flooding for a v evacuations for a number of Rekhiahat's residents near Ashbooten overnight. Heavy rain in the South Island was too tough for the river's mouth to handle with around five households facing water damage. Kevin Alfield speaking on behalf of local civil defence says the deluge came so quickly there there was no warning. The old shop that's covered, but they can't get the water run out of there. And there's two or three others here that have got it, one just here. One bedroom's flooded in their land, they're going to sleep the spare room. The one on the far end, it's wet, but those sleeping upstairs. officials will be assessing the damage this morning. Just under a turn and the Japanese Prime Minister will negotiate an intelligence sharing agreement as New Zealand looks to strengthen its ties with Japan amidst current tensions with China. Newshow political reporter Amelia Wei to is with the PM in Tokyo and sent this report. With Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China signing its Solomon security pact, which means it could bring warships, into our backyard. The meeting tonight will be about making sure Japan and New Zealand are on the same page on key issues because it's becoming increasingly important we have as many friends as possible with us in the Asia Pacific. The United States has pledged a further $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. Heavy artillery weapons, dozens of long-range canons, and 144,000 grounds of ammunition will be included in that package. Civilians are taking up arms as violence escalates in the East, and official scramble to evacuate more than 100,000 civilians from Maruyu Puyl. United States President Joe Biden says it takes a lot of bravery to use the weapons the U.S. is sending. You gotta admit, you must be amazed at the courage of this country, the resolve that they're showing, not just the military, but the average citizen, men and women, young men, young men, young women as well. Meanwhile, accused of being forming outside the Russian embassy in Ethiopia as men volunteer to fight against Ukraine. The UK's party gate scandal in Darling Street has escalated dramatically following an historic vote in Parliament. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will now be investigated over claims he misled MPs when he denied partying during lockdown. A police investigation into the gatherings has so far issued more than 50 fines to lawmakers and their associates. UK opposition leader, yes, Dama, says while Johnson had already lost the public's trust, today he lost his parties. None of his MPs wanted to vote against the Labour amendment. And I think the political mood changed today and you could feel it in the House of Commons. Speaking from his trip to India, Johnson says he's not worried, adding the whole scandal is a complete waste of time. There's no Indian sight for global supply chain issues as China continues to battle their COVID-19 outbreak. Shanghai is in its fourth week of a strict lockdown and operations at the world's busiest port at taking a major hit with productivity down by 40%. ITVs Debbie Edward told Newshub live at 8 Manufacturers warning supply issues could get much worse if things aren't back on track by next month. It's going to have a severe impact on their global trade, on global supply chains as you've been mentioning earlier, the economy already suffering and this could really worsen that further. There are reports, entire communities of people in Shanghai are being moved to control the spread. In sport, new blackferns director of rugby Wayne Smith says they need to put the Gleen Moore situation behind them as they look to defend their World Cup title later this year. The 65 year old's appointment comes after Moore's shock resignation over the weekend. Smith hopes to help guide the Blackferns to success at the World Cup. That is aware they've got to put all of the off-field drama behind them. Gone through a process of acknowledging it and girls are able to speak about it and then get on with what we've got to do now. It's just a reality. An outstanding first-half performance has guided Cronala to their fifth win of the NRL season as they held off a Gatsi mainly sighed 34 points to 22. Shak Center Siyo Sifa Talakai was virtually impossible to stop scoring two tries before turning provider for three others as the home side raced out to a 32 milleaded the break. The Sea Eagles stood their best to stage a second half comeback outscoring Cronala 22 points to 2. but they ultimately fell short as they suffered their third loss of the stage, a second half comeback, outscoring Cronulla 22 points to 2, but they ultimately fell short as they suffered their third loss of the season. That's the very latest from Newshub, it's 4 minutes past 6. Thank you very much, Bernadine. Now I did watch the Warriors on the weekend, and I was with a bunch of people who were very, very animated about the ref. And they were just hurling their opinions at the television. I couldn't possibly repeat what they said. But we were going to talk about this yesterday. This is criticism of referees in all sports I suppose, but particularly in these professional codes and rugby and league and the rules that seem to be in place around it, post-match, where it's like don't speak ill of the dead. You don't talk about the ref, you don't criticize their decisions directly, and certainly that was reflected in the post-match interview. So I just wonder this morning do you think that players should be able to freely, openly and honestly express their opinion, get it off their chest and criticise a ref. Feedback at amshoe.co.Nx.org. What do you reckon? I feel that there is a process to go through and I feel like airing that kind of criticism straight after the match is not the best way to go about looking into a referee's conduct. I don't think that the court of public opinion is the right place to make those decisions. But it's such a public sport,'t it? It's such a public occasion. Everybody's watching. So you need a release film don't you? You do and you do that in the privacy run home screaming at the TV. You know that's the good place to do it. The thing is there are rules in place for players and coaches. They can't just come off and sound off after the game because it's a part of protecting the referees who are doing their job aren't always going to get it right. Frustrating as it is. So that's what you think this is about. This is not about, you know, sort of protecting the integrity of the rules system. This is about the individual refs. Well no, I think it's both, isn't it? You are protecting the game, you're protecting... you can't do it and it sends sands are rules so this is global just New Zealand players cannot come off and say the reef was shite yeah but yeah but why not I mean if the ref is made multiple bad calls well you will you be a better reef wouldn't you be a better reef wouldn't you? No no if you're human you're not always going to get it right no you won't always get it right but if you consistently get it wrong then maybe there's an there's an issue an issue with you and there's an issue with you and there's a process to the same play and there's an issue with you. And there is a process to go through. Yeah, you do. I was speaking to the TMO from one of the games on the weekend. He was on the same plane as me and he was saying, we're having a review, it's probably not all going to be good for me. He knew that Patsy didn't get all the calls right and he was dreading it. In the meantime, everyone throwing hurling abuse at the television and they don't feel like the players are able to share in their misery. I don't know, I think it's weird. I sort of think like free speech, right? For me this feels like a little free speech issue. And free speech is like farting, you've just got to get it out. Better out than in thunder when it's rules like this. It's just not going to be heard. You've got to go through it process. Actually, I suppose now that we say that there are rules to farting. You don't want to do it in public places. Or a lift. In a lift. You don't want to do it in front of lots of people. So maybe you've got a point. There is a process. There's a proper process to go through for a fart. But on the referees that would be great. Let's head to William now. William did you ever argue with the ref? Voice your concerns on the field? More than, ah, I did a couple of times, I'm not arguing, I'd go, oh come on ref and then he'd go, what was that? And then I'd sort of go into my shell and sort of hide away. But I scream at the TV all the time, I think the worries are really hard done by all the time. So I'm always like at home, like what Burns said, I'm just shouting at the TV when it's my own team. Like, come on, Rat. But anyway, I've got William in the dark, a special surprise. I've found some coumura. we found some coumura. these huge kumirate and it brings me back to a little story of my auntie fiddimuckle and uncle Pungu Pungo they had a kumirate patch and these are a little bit on the smaller side compared to their ones just that photosynthesis the fertilizer all that so they were traditionally probably weather weather weather people in their own right knowing just the photosynthesis side of it so let's head to the weather around the motor. and the Coromandelion Peninsula and now also for Baya Plenty and Gisman. Those down south taking the Crown Range Road and Milford Road areas be on alert as there is an orange snow for warning in place. Moving on to the rest of your weather, morning rain clears for a mostly fine afternoon for the lower south and the strong southerlies die down by this evening. Mahuna Queenstown 13 degrees and Otipotti Di Dineyrdenen 14. It's a cloudy day on the west coast with a few showers this morning, Kawatiri Westport 19 degrees and Marfera, Grandmouth 18. Canterbury and Marlborough has a mostly fine day but watch out for some morning rain and gazsu afternoon southerlys, terai haarakekekae blenem 20 degrees in all totahi Christchurch 16. It's a wet start for the lower north. There's heavy rain buckets down this morning, but it's only for a bit that will die down, that will die out before lunch. Tefanganui, Atadaw, this afternoon. Now Mutu, New Plymouth, 21 degrees in Topo, 19. Moving on to the East Coast, and the rain remains heavy with downpaws and thunderstorms, the sun will try to pop through though, but it won't start clearing until the evening. Aherdira Napia and Taurang are both 22 degrees. And right up there, the top of our country, you have a lot more rain headed your way with heavy falls again, more thunderstorms. this eases to the odd shower by the afternoon and clears tonight. Darmiki, Macota, Auckland and Kirikirirar, Hamilton, both on 21 degrees. Looking ahead to your long weekend and Saturday is looking great with a few showers for the upper north-east and lower south-west coasts. Sunday will be wet along the west coast for both islands but fine elsewhere. Okay guys I've got a a bit of a proverb a multi-proverb a little little thing I used to tell our camera man actually when somebody's being a little too arrogant and talking about themselves a bit and about how good they are at camera work there's a little cumeter thing that, a little moldy proverb which is never tell anybody, the cumeter never tells anybody how sweet it is. So Leon, just for something you remind me. And Leon's defense, he is pretty good. So use that one. Yeah, but it's just a he shouldn't say it himself. Good advice William. We'll be back with you later on mate. Good to see you. And I love it how he got stuck into the ref too on national television. Good to see isn't it? Love seeing that. It worries refs, you're a little dig when he can. 11 minutes past six. The trial of Johnny Dep is getting being laid bare in the defamation battle with his ex and be heard. For more on this, our US entertainment correspondent Sam Rubin joins us. Sam, I don't even think a Hollywood script writer would write stuff this bizarre. What is the latest we've heard? It's extraordinarily bizarre. Mel, here in the United States we had a television show for many years called Divorce Court and this seems like an elongated and particularly horrific horrific horrific version of that TV show. This has been going on now. Johnny Depp in his third day of testimony, the first two days he was speaking to his own lawyer, so there were friendlier questions, and he told a horrible tale, a tale of extraordinary abuse he endured as a child. It led to a variety of personal problems for him. Then he discussed his initial romance and attraction with Amber Hurd, and then their marriage, and then he said essentially things changed. And all disputes, all violence, all bad behavior, gee, it was all her fault. He squarely points the finger at Amber Hurd, saying he never raised a hand to Amber, to any woman, he never would. That was that. Now, now that Amber's lawyer is questioning Johnny Depp, they're focusing in on Johnny Depp's extraordinary use and abuse of alcohol and drugs. Just a little earlier this morning, they shared with the courtroom and thus the world a photo of a completely passed out Johnny Depp with an ice cream cone melted on his trousers. He said that Amber handed him the ice cream cone, knew he was high and knew that this would be an opportunity to take a picture that would make him look bad. So essentially, they just keep muddying one another up. There have been things that have made Amber Heard look terrible as well. A phone call, a recording of which she sounded just shrill and angry. So, so far, we've endured almost entirely, he said. At some point, and it could be as soon as tomorrow, Amber Heard will take the stand on her birthday, no less. And then it's she said. Again he is suing her for $50 million she's countersuing him for a hundred million. So it could be interesting when the tables turn. There's been some big names dropped in in the testimony too. Just hours ago two major names that I think will generate a lot of headlines. Johnny Depp talked about how Elton John assigned his own personal drug counselor to meet with Johnny and try to wrestle him away from drugs. So Elton's name was mentioned. Then the actor Paul Bettine's name came up quite a bit and a variety of text exchanges between Johnny Depp and Paul Bettine. Mostly what was focused on text that Johnny Depp sent to Paul Bettany, where he called Amber Heard, a witch, and a variety of other words we won't use on morning television and New Zealand or anywhere else, but really shocking and vulgar texts. And again, the idea, I think, simply, and this is a smaller jury than normal, seven jurors and four alternates sitting in a Virginia courtroom weighing the fate here. Who do you believe? And in terms of the legal case, Johnny Depp, I think, has a very, very difficult burden of proof because he has to prove that not only did Amber Heard lie about him, she did it deliberately and with malice. What is the center of this case is an article Amber Heard wrote for the Washington Post. The Washington Post has their printing presses in Virginia. That's why the trials being held in Virginia, because that's where the article was printed. And she never in that article mentioned Johnny Depp by name, but Johnny Depp said people clearly knew who she was talking about when she said she was a survivor of domestic abuse. Again, for his part, Johnny says none of this is true. It's entirely her fault. When we hear Amber's side of the case, I feel the accusations will go exactly the other way. And what's the circus around this like? Are there lots of people outside court? Are these stories leading headlines all over the US? You know, it's very interesting because unlike the trial in Britain where cameras were not allowed in the courtroom, I think this is generating a degree of attention because cameras are in the courtroom. But one thing, and this is sort of a media remark, but I think it bears repeating, Johnny Depp speaks very slowly, very haltingly. To use a television phrase, he doesn't make good sound bites. So the story is getting some attention, but it's not getting nearly as much attention as I think it would if he had sort of better sound bites I think you ever heard is yeah I wonder about you know he's an actor he knows what he's doing doesn't he I'm always the entertainment correspondent Sam Rubin thanks very much for being with us this morning on the latest with the Johnny Depp trial well it's just it's a slow-moving it's a slow-moving train wreck isn't it it's a slow-moving train wreck isn't it? It's a hot mess. It's almost like not I don't want to watch actually. Yeah, yeah. It's kind of getting to that point isn't it? I mean there's cheating and then there's drugs and then there's this really toxic relationship. Whatever was going on it wasn't good for either side.

Tonight we get to know some of the contestants of Dancing with the Stars who are about to grace our screens. And the new book that's helping young Kiwi kids cope with grief. The project's 7 p.m. on 3. Häm, the feeling of New It's 21 minutes past six. And right time to talk health care. You could be about to pay more for your child to see a doctor and some kids could miss out altogether. One thousand GPs and urgent care clinics across the country are sounding an alarm bell this morning saying the government funding is not keeping pace with rising costs and free visits for under 14s might need to be scrapped. joining us this morning Dr Angus Chambers, the General Practice Owners Association Deputy Chair, good morning. So let's start with some of the services that might need to be cut back or scrapped or or that aren't being fully funded. There's the under 14, free for under 14s. What else might be on the chopping block? Well I guess community services cards have a, holders have a reduced fee so that's another area that people could opt out of the schemes to to to enable that lower fee. I mean and then you've got all your kind of business as usual which is you know people getting cervical screening and and you know chronic disease management the costs go up people will potentially miss out because of that. Okay so let's talk about how this works. So your costs have gone up you've said between 14 and 17% cost inflation why? Well I guess health is an area where there is a lot of costs and a very big area is a nursing costs. With the district health board settlements with their nursing teams, you know, the difference between a well, if the pay equity came, claim goes through, difference between wages will be close to 30% so there's extreme pressure there. There's a lot of staff shortages around the country, certainly doctors, but also our nursing teams and reception now. And so the pressure is going on wages as well. Medical supplies, there's increasing costs in there. So all through the business you lot this this cost increases. Okay so you've got these costs increasing you say for GP clinics between 14 and 17 percent and then on the other side of the ledger you've got what the government gives you for these services like free under 14 healthcare and as you say the childhood immunisations how much are you how much is the increase you get for that? Is it meeting, is it keeping pace with your costs? Well there's a kind of a formula that's used to try and anticipate increased costs and to, because the government clearly would like to keep patient fees down, but this year the formula delivered, well in the last 12 months, a 2.78% increase. Okay well that doesn't sound very good. Well you know we've the the GenPro has challenged the formula and the district health boards and Ministry of Health actually agree that the formula is not this purpose but they've declined to do anything about it. Okay so now doctors GP's energy and care clinics are left in this position where you're trying to make up the short fall and you're trying to balance the books right so that you can keep the healthcare happening. At what point do they say we can't keep doing free for under 14s and are they allowed to stop offering that service? Yes, well the three under four teams is an opt-in service so you are allowed to opt out of it and go back to the situation that was there before three under four teams. So I guess it's a business decision and I think no one would like to do that because we all value the health of our children so much. But, you know, I guess it comes down to calculations in the end. And if you're losing money on providing a service, you have to think carefully about whether you can continue doing it. I think you mentioned childhood immunisations. We significantly lose money on childhood immunisations but I would be surprised if we stop doing them because we are very big believers in immunisations and have been for a long time and you know, so some of the things will continue because we'd like to think we're ethical as well. Okay, we'd like to think you are too. But there will be some people watching this morning, Dr Chambers, who might be thinking, well, you know, those doctors, they drive around and flash cars, are doctors screaming it, you know? I mean, do they have huge profit margins at these GP clinics and these after-our clinics? Well, look, you know, I'm not privy to everyone's business arrangements, but I'll say there'll be some people doing reasonably well, but some people are not well at all. And, you know, I think you've got to understand that the pressure on the workforce is quite intense and there's competition throughout the world for staff. So there's very high pressures on the wages in that sense. But also in some of our rural areas where there's small practices with that, a lot of support and you know in our socio-economic areas people, people will be really struggling and there's a very very big difference between the wages of general practitioners and hospital doctors. Yes, which is which is an issue I think for another day, but a one well raised. Thank you very much for your time this morning. We appreciate it. General Practice Owners Association Deputy Chair, Dr Angus Chambers, it is 26 after 6. It is 26 after 6. Interesting they are basically wanting the funding that they get for some of these services to keep pace with their rising costs, which it sounds like like for everyone are going up. Yeah more than the 2% and I think a lot of people across the board do think that that under 14 healthcare is free but GP practices can and do choose to not offer that when they just can't justify those costs.

Just Sandra Dern and the Japanese Prime Minister have met for the first time discussing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent tensions in the Indo-Pacific region after China's security deal with the Solomon Islands. Political reporter Emili Wade sent this report from Tokyo. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a major focus of Justinda Arduin's first meeting with her Japanese counterpart, Prime Minister Fumio Kashida, which is just wrapped up. Both leaders said they are both committed to raising the cost of her. They're calling the architects of Russia's illegal actions. We share a sense of common purpose in our response to the current crisis in Ukraine. And I acknowledge the strong leadership offered by Prime Minister Kashida. We discussed this conflict at great length because we are at a critical juncture. The pair are also worried about China, saying they had grave concerns about the human rights situation in the Xinjiang province and the erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong. Rakh residents were struck by surprise overnight with flash flooding hitting the small village. Officials will be addressing damage this morning which was caused by high river levels following heavy rain across the South Island. Police say three homes on Pacific Drive were evacuated shortly after nine o'clock with other properties facing water damage. Climate change advocates are making their voices heard on Earth Day, handing over a petition to government, calling for an immediate ban on new fossil fuel boilers in New Zealand. 350 altiadouroure will hand over the petition with 19,000 signatures during a gathering at Wellington's Midland Park this afternoon. The government has already committed to being carbon neutral by 2025, but the advocate group says banning new installations of fossil fuel heating sources will take concrete steps towards its goals. Earth Day is celebrated globally with the target of bringing awareness to the impacts human actions have on climate change. Ukraine's president is pleading with the West to speed up supplies. The United States has pledged to further $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. Heavy artillery weapons, dozens of long-range canons, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition will be included in the package. But Ukraine President, Vlodimizolens, says for the people of Marjupol, every hour counts. The situation is difficult, as you know. Nearly 120,000 civilians are blocked in Marjopold, according to our latest estimations. Zelenski says in 57 days of war, more than 1,000 Ukrainian towns have been occupied occupied by invaders and millions have been forced to flee. There are warnings that inflation could spell the end of free GP visits for under 14s and other essential health services. General practice, owner's association deputy chair, Dr. Angus Chambers, says it will come down to what individual GPs can manage. No one would like to do that because we all value the health of our children so much. But, you know, I guess it comes down to calculations in the end. And if you're losing money on providing a service, you have to think carefully about whether you can continue doing it. Barrett who has a red card track record will be on the sidelines until the middle of May which Scott Robinson says gives him plenty of time to work on his tackle technique. At that moment, you know, he could have been better and you know, he's got a few more weeks to work on it technically which is part of the three weeks of Ben and then also just on the mental service game. The Crusaders clash with the Rebels on Sunday night. Formula One star Lewis Hamilton and tennis great Serena Williams are among the investors backing Sir Martin's bid to buy Chelsea.

Hamilton and Williams have pledged money into the bid along with world athletics president Lord Sir Bastian Co. Finally at 630 researchers in Japan have developed taste-enhancing chopsticks. I've been designed to make food more enjoyable for people who have to eat bland food due to health issues using electric pulses pulses. The sticks move sodium iron into the tips replicating the taste of salt recent data shows the daily salt intake of Japanese adults is about 10 grams double the amount of the world health organization recommendations I just need help with my chopstick action not the taste that's the very latest from Newshub it is 24 to 7 could be useful for people who a lot of people will say that they've lost their taste buds after COVID so maybe that could help spur it help 24 to 7. Could be useful for people who a lot of people will say that they've lost their taste buds after COVID so maybe that could help spur it on a bit. So it mimics the taste of salt but you don't actually get the salt but you don't actually get the salt intake because I don't know about you but when I make my eggs in the weekend you know eggs on toast I'm just like howing that grinder that grinder and moderation and a little bit of salt's all right stop the cramps you know you know but that's I think I'm howing the grinder too much there's a lot of salt going on the eggs that you're having... I only have sticks with sugar so I stopped the little salt tree, that's a good idea what else could we put on there little chocolate chopsticks? alcohol a little bit of wine yeah it tastes like you're having it you're not where's a fun in that? We were speaking earlier about whether you should be able to criticize the referee as a player after the game or whether there is another process that you should go down. You have a chopstick that makes you feel like you've abused the ref. But you have it. That's called like an electric prod. Well Doug says, I don't mind the players being able to say things about the refs after the game providing the refs can say things about the players. Oh true but they do they kind of do on the field. Yeah and they have microphones now and they get some of them were quite sassy with the players too are they? One more bit of feedback before we go to William with the weather. Kelly says sorry Barney says we can get over one or two bad calls but nearly half a dozen in a game. Come on, take away their match payments if they officiate a really bad game. The players get fine thousands when they criticize the officials. It's only fair. So there we go, lots of views this morning. yours appreciated too, feedback at amcho.co.org.az.com.

Right, there is plenty for rugby fans to look forward to this weekend as the trans-Tasman super super rugby round kicks off. So what can we expect? Sallik Sport Time, it is called a to 7. Good morning, how are you?. Good thank you. So this is called the Super Rugby round kicks off. So what can we expect? Sully Sport time. It is called it to seven. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Good, thank you. So this is called the Super Rugby Magic Round. Correct. So a player's going to disappear. Is there rabbits out of hats? Is it a rabbits out of hats? What's happening? No, it's not quite like that. It's Magic Ground. Everyone. Everyone's going to be playing in Melbourne over the weekend, so I think that's about six games are going to be played on Friday, Saturday, and then Sunday. So it's a pretty entertaining weekend for those that are in Melbourne that can get across to the game. And it's the first time, you know, we're heading over to the Tasman, the Kiwis taking on the Ozzy, so that rivalry back in action, so it's pretty entertaining. It's very cool, it's an exciting format, I think, is what you would think, is what you would say what you would say, that are's the point of it? Is it just to create a bit of hype, bit of buzz? Yeah, it is exactly that. It's create a bit of hype for those that are in Melbourne, those that want to, you know, get along to the game, that want to enjoy super rugby, you don't get to always see the best teams in Melbourne. So, you know, it's a, question. I mean, personally, I think it's a great place to play any sport. It's a great sporting city. I'd, you know, prefer to go there over Sydney, anything like that. But yeah, it's a great, an occasion. We should just be... Well, it's a thing COVID related. Well, Sydney streamed with Eneral at the moment, isn't it? So you probably don't have it a venue available available. coming through with the facts. Burning nuggets. Just guessing. No good point, good point. Hey the Phoenix, their second home game at Eden Park. Yeah the first game was pretty sad to watch being a football fan myself. Yeah four nil thrashing was not what you'd want to come home to when you're in Wellington, you know, all those fans came out, 18,000 I think, so it was a bit unfortunate to come out to a loss like that. But you know they can make a mens at Eden Park this Sunday. They're taking on the Western Sydney Wanders. So they're a little bit further down the ladder. So that's a good opportunity for hopefully Phoenix fans to be able to celebrate a win this weekend and what a win hopefully will do is launch them into the top four and hopefully if they can hold on to that. they can come home for an elimination final, maybe in the next month. Huge weekend of Anzac sport, of course. The test, the Warriors and the Storm, how are they going to shake up, you think? Yeah, I mean, being a betting man, I definitely wouldn't put money on the Warriors. They haven't had a good run of form in the last few Anzac test. I think it's like the last five they've lost. they've lost against, they're losing streak against the Melbourne Storms extended back to 2015. So it doesn't really bode well for them, so you know, hopefully they'll be looking to break that whoo this weekend. And I think the way they played against the Roosters last week, albeit they had a few calls go their their way, unfortunately. I think they'll be in for a real good shot and you know they get up for these Ozzy New Zealand rivalry matches every year so I wouldn't put it past the Warriors but money is definitely on Melbourne to win this one. Do you think that players should be able to criticize the referees? Like go for it like like open slathers. Yes, good so do I do. Sully's on my side. I think I think it creates a bit a creates a bit of controversy. It gets a bit of controversy. It gets a bit of controversy. It gets a bit of controversy, it gets the news out there. I know it's not always the news that people want to hear about, but you know I think the NRL are great about it. While they do find their players for when they come out with these outrageous comments and whatnot, it's something maybe Super Rugby can adopt, you know, I thought Aaron, what, Aaron Smith came out with the other week when he was in that Harlander's game was exactly what we need. Yeah and the thing is everyone at home is thinking it and unless the players say it you just feel like they're being gagged you know it's it's almost like what's the point. Is it different in the in league to union though because the rules are so much more complex in union right? It's clear more clear cut and as a league player you can say whatnot that was wrong but in union it's like was it wrong. we'll have to look through the book but they too also get sent shouldn't fine don't it's almost like the ausies don't care they'll say it anyway and cop the fine yeah all the coaches Wayne Bennett that's so vocal so outspoken which is I love to hear I love to hear that authentic like what do you actually think you know you always you know go through to press conferences know you know you know you know you never really ask the the hard truth of it will just like wants to know why they made the mistake. Why did you do that? Why do you why do you think you got it wrong? And they always... It's chiptoeing around. Sally do you reckon it's to protect them? to protect them and their integrity and who'd want to if you're going to get abuse. look at kids sports. you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know?... you get parents abusing the rest. But then make better calls. You know, if you don't want to get abused for making bad calls, make the right ones. Have you ever been told off Ben on the sidelines? I'll tell if you tell. Well, I haven't personally, my mum, I think, did get banned from the netball courts. Sorry, mum. And on that note, thanks, Sully, Sully. Good.. And on that note, thanks Sully, good to see you.

Well, Dad, you've experienced a lot and you were a telegrapist in the Navy through the war and you had six brothers also went off to war and they all came home which is quite an achievement. The achievement is that I'm very proud of. Mommy had to wait for six of us for overseas. I only went to Australia to... A Fiji. VG. And... And... Dad was a signalman, a telegrapist monitoring the Japanese signals around the Pacific. And... Ah. And the... What's he going to be doing on Anzac Day, Ken? Well, I think Dad might be one of the few WW2 veterans remaining, certainly on Capitol Coast, but over the years he's been active in the OTACI RSA and has regularly gone to one of their ceremonies during the day. I'm not sure that we'll be making it this year, but if dad's up for it, I'll certainly take him along. I don't think so either. Ken, what is the secret to your dad's longevity? Kulin, what's the secret to your longevity? Oh, whipped cream and whiskey, probably? Whip cream and whiskey? Yeah. That sounds like a pretty good tip. We'll get onto the whipped cream and whiskey very same. I have one whiskey a day. Come on, yeah. In fact, it's interesting. When dad was born, he wasn't expected to live more than a few days. He was underweight and premature, and the hospital in Gore said that he probably wouldn't survive more than two or three days and here we are a hundred and two years later. Wow. That's where I got the Wallace from. My first name is Wallace and it was Nurse Wallace that kept me alive she found in Glexo. Yeah. I can eat Glexo. And, uh, but was in the main hospital. Grecso. Yeah. I can eat Grecso. Yeah. And, uh, I was in the hospital, in the main hospital, not, not, not, the nursing home. And, uh, Wow and here you are at 102. Amazing. Well you nearly share a birthday with a Queen and you've probably, well you would have had a letter at 102, surely you should get, you know, I don't know, some kind of gift from the Queen. That had a lead from the Queen, the Prime Minister and the Governor General at 100 and we haven't received the Queen's run yet but I think we can understand that the Queen's not in the best of health at the moment. Well Ken and Kewin Shirley we thank you both very much for joining us and Kewin have a wonderful one hundred and second birthday. How I'm very cool is that? Thank you Melissa. Happy birthday from all of us here at AM and thanks for your service as well. What a lovely story about nurse Wallace at Gore Hospital. Yeah very cool. There'll be nurses watching in that this morning and I mean that is why you do that job isn't it? Because he has lived to a hundred and two years old and expected to last a couple of days. Ken Shirley was the member of Parliament wasn't? Yeah he looked familiar and he was was um... he was in cabinet I think Ken Shirley. Anyway, I digress it is 7 of April, you're with AM. It's wonderful to have your company and lots coming on the show this hour, we're being worn to expect more pain in the pocket with high inflation likely to keep rising. But can we keep blaming international pressures? Labour Minister David Parker and National's Deputy Leader, Nicola Nicola Nicola Willis, debate this in 10 minutes. New Zealand is closening its ties with Japan, negotiating get this intelligence sharing. This is spy stuff. So what will China make of it? We ask an expert that's coming up just before 730. Later in the show we speak to two war veterans to hear their stories of service ahead of a very of a very special Anzac day. That's at 714. And Dancing with the Stars starts Sunday night here on three and William is with this year's competitors just before 730. Right now time for your news. To money it's 7 o'clock. There are warnings that inflation could spell the end of free doctor's visits for under under 14s as GP clinics come under increased pressure. General practice owners association deputy chair Dr Angers Chambers says it'll come down to what individual doctors can manage. It's a business decision and you know I think no one would like to do that because we all value the health of our children so much. But I guess it comes down to calculations in the end. And if you're losing money on providing a service, you have to think carefully about whether you can continue doing it. Just under Adirin, the Japanese Prime Minister have met for the first time, discussing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent tensions in the Indo-Pacific region after China's security deal with the Solomon Islands. Political reporter Amelia Wade sent this report from Tokyo. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a major focus of Jacinda Dern's first meeting with her Japanese counterpart, Prime Minister Fumio Kashida, which is just wrapped up. Both leaders said they are both committed to raising the cost of who they're calling the architects of Russia's illegal actions. We share a sense of common purpose in our response to the current crisis in Ukraine and I acknowledge the strong leadership offered by Prime Minister Kashida. We discussed this conflict at great length because we are at a critical juncture. The pair are also worried about China saying they had grave concerns about the human rights of the human rights of the This is just this conflict at great length because we are at a critical juncture. The pair are also worried about China saying they had grave concerns about the human rights situation in the Xinjiang province and the erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong. Police have had some success in their search for a missing fisherman in the Bay of Plenty. A coast guard plane found a chili bin washed up on on Whale Island which is believed to belong to the man. Search efforts will resume this morning along the coastline from Waihi Beach to the Motu River mouth. Ukraine is fighting back. Russian claims that the port city of Marjupol has fallen. Vladimir Putin has declared victory in the city where fighting has seen the death and displacement of thousands. But in an address to the World Bank, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zalinsky says the fighting is far from over. We're renewing transportation lines, building up temporary bridges on the rivers. Active combat action is going on. Russia is still trying to build up and new and atrocious offensive. A fresh investigation is being launched into whether the British Prime Minister is an offensive operation. Meanwhile Russia has turned to Ethiopia to recruit more fighters with people lining up at the embassy to enroll. A fresh investigation is being launched into whether the British Prime Minister deliberately misled Parliament. Boris Johnson this week apologised for attending a party breaking the lockdown rules his government had set. But MPs have since approved the Privileges Committee launching an inquiry once the police have finished their own investigation. Speaking from his trip to India, Johnson says he's not worried. Adding the whole scandal is a complete waste of time. The man fighting Scott Morrison's next Prime Minister has tested positive for COVID. Australia's opposition leader Anthony Albanese has been on the campaign trail ahead of the country's federal elections in May. He tested positive during a regular PCR test late last night. Albanese says it's a bit of blow but he'll continue campaigning from home while isolating. In sport, new Blackfoons Director of Rugby, Wayne Smith says they need to put the Glean Moore situation behind them as they look to defend their World Cup title later this year. The 65-year-old's appointment comes after Moore's shock resignation over the weekend. Smith hopes to help guide the Blackfoons to success of the World Cup but is aware they've got to pull all of the off-field drama behind them. Gone through a process of acknowledging it and girls are able to speak about it and then get on with what we've got to do now. It's just a reality. Warriors coach Nathan Brown is refusing to offload the blame for his team's lost to the Sydney Roosters last weekend. The kibby side or on the receiving end of some marginal calls from referees which resulted in the club slipping to a 22 to 14 defeat against the Roosters. But Brown would not point the finger at official saying he's still not ready to let his team off the hook that easily. Our main focus has got to be on, you know, as a coaching staff, what could we do better last week and what can we do better going forward and the players need to look at, you know, how can I do better, what can I be better, how can I prepare better, how can I play better, how can I play better? That's the very latest for Newshub, it's 5 past 7. Thank you know professional. And this is after the Warriors and a couple of things with Aaron Smith etc. Josh is I feel like the players get criticised for poor performance by anyone. The media, coaches, teammates and my dad on the couch who doesn't even know what sport he's watching. Why can't we be honest about a referee's performances as well after the game if a player wants to let rip why not let them it's kind of hard to argue with that isn't it you can't do the same so you can't let rip at your bosses in public yeah but they're not but the rest not the boss well he is on the field and he's officially and he's officially once the games the games over he's over he's and he's officiating. Yeah but once the game's over he's gone. Okay so once you come off there you can go and mouth off if you're not happy about something. I do regularly. I go straight to their desk and I say do I go straight to their desk and I say do you know what I mean is is that comparable? I think so but I but again I think you know it's free speeches like a fart better out than in. But do you want to keep your job? Probably. Well yeah but you also want to be able to you know express yourself don't you? You do but there's ways and as Melissa said this process. Yeah I think there's a way to go about it. Let's head to William who is bringing back some old moves behind the stage of dancing with the stars this morning. Hey William anything you want to get off your chest William? No you get down to the fields and test No, Zero, as a ref, I've just got down at domain, so I thought it'd be good to come down here and actually get down to the fields and test out what, you know, what they'd be going through in these moments. But it's so, like, gloomy, you can't see anything, hey, it's incredible. Down here, you can usually see all the skyline, you can't see anything, it's such a misty morn. But let's here, to the weather, I around the weather, to the weather, I around the motto. Tomorrow's weather brought you by nature turned into power by meridian. Severe weather watches in the North Island including a heavy rainwatch for Mount Taranaki, lower Northland, Auckland, Waikato, the Karamandal Peninsula and now also for Bae-Klinti and Gismund, those down south taking the Crown Range Road and Milford Road areas be on alert as there is an orange snowfall warning in place. Now moving on to the rest of your weather, morning rain clears for a mostly fine afternoon for the lowest south and the strong southerlies died down by this evening. Thahuna Queena Queena Queenstown, 13thoen, 13thoena Queenstown, 13 Tahuna Queenstown 13 degrees in Otiporti, Dunedin 14. It's cloudy on the west close with a few showers this morning. Kawatidi West bought 19 degrees and Marfira Greymouth 18. Catabria Malbra has a mostly fine day but watch out for some morning rain and gusty afternoon southerlies to Waajara Kiki blendim 20 degrees and a total hae Christchurch 16. It's a wet start for the lower north as heavy rain buckets down this morning but it's only for a bit it will die out before lunch to Fanganui Atara Wellington and the Capite Coast 20 degrees. There's more heavy rain for the central plateau this time with the side of thunderstorms but this also starts easing by this afternoon. namuu two newume 21 degrees in Topol 19. Moving on to the East Coast, and the rain remains heavy with downpaws and thunderstorms. The sun will try and pop its nose out later on in the evening. Ahuriri Napea and Tohang are both on 22 degrees. And right up the top of our country, you have a lot more rain headed your way with heavy falls and again more thunderstorms, this eases to the odd shower by the afternoon and clears tonight. Damke, Macota, Auckland and Kerekiridore, Hamilton, 21 degrees. Looking ahead to your long, long, long weekend and Saturday is looking grey with a few showers for for the upper North East and lower South West Coast. Sunday will be wet along with the West Coast for both islands but fine everywhere else. I love it down at the domain. You really feel those vibes and people running. It's such a dynamic morning. It's good to see everyone out there keeping fit regardless. It's awesome. And how many runs in a row are you up to now, William? Dogs. Two years, one month. Now, two years, one month in a row. So, how long have we got to go until your goal? What are you trying to get to? I'm looking at a thousand, but because I feel so good after doing it, I want to keep on going.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... it going. I don't want to stop. Thanks very much. We'll see. William we'll catch up you a little bit later on. Ten minutes past seven. Now the cost of food is an issue weighing heavily on our minds and on our pockets and the overwhelming feedback we received from you after our interview with a food grower yesterday is proof of that. with an 18% increase in fruit and veggie prices since this time last year, we wanted to know if growers were making big profits, but found out the converse is true from Jay Clark of Woodhaven Gardens. I'm howing up Iceberg lettuce by the hectic every day at the moment because the price that the retailers are willing to pay for it is so far below our cost of production. To discuss those costs, I'm joined now by Labour Minister David Parker and National Party Deputy Leader Nicola Willis, good morning to you both. Good morning, Hays, you're coming in. David first of all did you know that truckloads of good food is that truckloads of good food is being turfed out because the growers cost are so high? I didn't know of this particular incidents but I've known of it in the past, yes, so they're complaining that the price that they're being offered by the supermarket is too low to cover their costs and so they're plowing their lettuces and instead of selling them to the supermarket. Well, one of the reasons is because their costs are so high and they're saying that is partly due to international pressures like fertiliser and fuel, but there's a lot of domestic pressures too like their wage costs have gone up 60%. immigration settings, mean they've got a shortage of workers, there's huge regulatory costs, I mean these are all costs that the government can do something about, right? Well wages haven't gone up by 60% in New Zealand, so I'm not quite sure how that number comes to be, but but in respect of some of the other pressures like fuel, yes it is true that fuel costs are up. I think there's also a market competition element here. We have an inquiry into the excessive or lack of competition in supermarkets and we're reporting on that in the next month as to what we're going to do in response to recommendations to improve competitions in supermarkets because there's only two buyers, big buyers of letters of letters in New Zealand, the two supermarket chains and maybe they've got too much market power. Nicola, these are regulatory costs too that are affecting them. They're saying they have to get resource consent for to grow, then a separate resource consent to wash and to irrigate. These are costs that you could bring down? Yes, absolutely. Look, I've met with Jay and Woodhaven Gardens and what they tell me is the government just puts on costs without thinking about the impact that will have and of course any extra costs they face, ultimately they pass on to us as consumers in the supermarket. So this is really a time where the government at every possibility should be thinking how can we make sure we're not adding costs, we're not putting more pressure on, we're not adding red tape, we're not adding compliance because in the end we all end up paying for that. But in 2017 Horticulture New Zealand put out a report, this was back when National was still in government and on the issue of needing more land to grow, it said that high quality land is being turned into houses. Sure people need somewhere to live but what uses a house without infrastructure or enough accessible food to feed the household. So have successive governments ignored the importance of being able to grow domestically? Well look it is important that we maintain those really productive soils but New Zealand doesn't lack for land. What we have lacked for is planning laws that allow houses to be built where we want them to be built and nationals actually been very constructive and worked with the government on reforms to the Resource Management Act to make that easier and that will mean that we can keep that productive land for fruit and vegetables. But I tell you the other thing that really matters to these growers and that's getting workers and that's getting workers and and they look at the fact that there are 55,000 more people now on a job-seeker benefit than when labour came to power and they ask themselves why is it so hard to find people to pick the fruit and pick the vegetables because that's a real constraint. Why is it so hard? Well unemployment's lower than it was when National Left Government it's at 3.2% at the moment is very low very low. Can I address the issue around the highly productive soils? We do need to better protect them and we've actually got an instrument covering under the RMA to actually protect those RMA to actually protect those soils from being encroached upon by too much housing. But I do agree with Nicola. One of the answers to that is you've got to have more intensive housing in growing cities. And so we have to work with the National Party to pass legislation to enable more intensive housing development both to bring down housing costs but also to protect those highly productive soils. But yeah, they're saying, you know, it's illegal to plant in some areas and if we want to protect our domestic food production, we have to make it easier and cheaper for growers to be able to access this land and not be paying red tape costs for the land first of all and then to just be able to irrigate and watch them. I too have been to this farm. It's actually quite complex there, Lake Horafenua which is adjacent to this farm, we're very near to it, is so polluted you can't swim in it now. Right, okay let's make that's another issue entirely. Let's move on to RAM raids. It's been revealed that 88% of RAM raids are under the age of carried out by people under the age of 20 and that in actual fact the majority are under the age of 17. So what do we do about it? We asked former police Minister Paula Bennet who was on a m yesterday and she said she's been talking to frontline police officers this was their idea. Police would say why don't we have a special law that is for an exceptional small proportion of young people that have done multiple crimes that means that we can do home detention, that means that we can actually have extra checks on them, that we can make sure that they're where they're actually where they're supposed to be and not where they're not, and give them some extra powers for a very few select under a strict criteria. Nicola, how about it? It's a smart idea. I think that when you think about these kids, it's tragic because clearly things are going wrong at home, aren't they? when you've got an 11-year-old driving driving a in a ram raid. So the idea of wrapping more intensive police supervision and more services around those kids really makes sense. I think about it from a social investment perspective. Let's put the intensive support in early so that those kids don't end up wreaking destruction and destroying people, families, communities for decades to come. Would you see it as support early if you're introducing a law to... Well I'm not sure what the law would say. This is already illegal behaviour. I do agree with Nicola that these problems are probably primarily in the home and I'm not sure that policing will fix that. You know there was that recent RAM raid where there were nine people they caught all nine of them in the police because we've got plenty of police. You know, we've got 700 extra police. So what would the law say, Nicola? Well, I think that the law would say that where police have concerned that young people are consistently putting themselves into dangerous situations that are threatening the safety of others, then they they have the opportunity to supervise them more closely. Well that's already the law. We can't just speak back David and say it's all too difficult don't worry we'll just let the rambourines continue let the kids go on their path of destruction that's all fine the law is I agree we need to do could be prepared to better could I get away it it's a headline it's already illegal it's illegal. You're calling for the police to do the social work. I don't think that that would work. All right. Thank you very much. I'm Nicola Willis, Deputy National Party leader and Labour Minister David Parker. Thanks very much for joining us. It's just gone 17 minutes after 7 o'clock now.

And it's great to have your company. Right. New Zealand is going to share classified security information with Japan in a bid to keep a lid on China's growing grip on the Asia-Pacific-Pacific region. Prime Minister Jacinda Adairn and her Japanese counterpart announced last night then negotiating an information sharing agreement for closer engagement on security issues. Joining us now is Otago University international relations expert Robert Patman. Good morning. Good morning Ryan. This is a very interesting development. How will China feel? Because given the history between China and Japan, how will China feel about this? Well, I don't think China will be a static about it and it may well sort of make some rumbling noises in diplomatic terms in the direction of New Zealand, but I think it's no secret that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and this government have been seeking to upgrade the relationship with Japan for for a number of years and There was making good good progress before the interruption of COVID-19 and I think developments in the last this year have given it added impetus Chinese the the China security agreement with the Solomon Islands and also of course the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these are both seen as, how should I put it, challenges to the international rules-based order which both Japan and New Zealand hold very closely. So... Yeah, the game's changing, the game's changing. But China should kind of expect that this is what would happen when you start to ever closer to our region, to our territory. I note that Australia signed a military agreement or an intention to sign a military agreement with Japan earlier this year and Beijing wasn't happy with that. They said they were stirring up trouble. Do you expect that we would get a similar response for this announcement? Not necessarily. I think decision-makers in Beijing have continued to make a distinction between Australia's closeness to the United States and New Zealand's slightly more distant relationship to the United States. We, of course, have a very good relationship with the Biden administration, but but historically we're not as close to the United States as Australia. The interesting thing is that in Tokyo the Prime Minister made a point of saying despite but despite welcoming this real you know almost breakthrough in relations with Japan, she said at the same time this is not a time to pigeonhole China as being closely aligned with Russia or words to that effect. So, this is not a time to pigeonhole China as being closely aligned with Russia or words to that effect. So I think there was a determination here on the point on the part of the government to try to keep a dialogue going with China and not in a sense buy into the argument that China is strictly aligned with Russia. I mean China has quite frankly been...... You don't want to bite the hand that you know that China is strictly aligned with Russia. I mean China is quite frankly being you don't want to bite the hand that feeds you do you? With China being our biggest trading partner obviously it's a tightrope that the Prime Minister is walking. For people who are watching this morning thinking well why do I care about this? You know why should I care what spy or intelligence information New Zealand shares with Japan. Why is this important? Well, it's very important for us as a country because, although we're a small player, we are globally active in terms of trade. We trade with more than 100 countries and we're dependent on something called the rules-based order. We're not big enough to make our own rules, so we need international institution to uphold them. And basically Japan and Zealand as well as the majority of countries in the world, CITWA on this and therefore this sharing of information is designed to make sure that countries which engage in unilateral actions such as China in relation to the South China Sea or Russia in relation to the Ukraine, These sort of authoritarian forces are held in check. Absolutely. Thanks so much for your time this morning and your analysis is always great to talk to you. Ataga University International Relations expert Robert Patman. It's just gone 25 minutes after seven. It's fascinating because as you know when I worked up in China the relationship between the Chinese and the Japanese is not good. You know, there's real animosity there from obviously years of war. So for New Zealand to be announcing something like this is I think going to be quite upsetting to people in Beijing. Will they take much notice? Does it actually mean something? This is the significance of sharing that information quite? I think so. I mean we heard from Robert there that they will definitely be taking notice. And they took notice when Australia signed or even announced an intention to sign a military pack with Australia, Japan. China said that they were stirring up trouble in the region. So I can imagine there will be some response from the Chinese embassy or Beijing in the days and weeks to come. It is 26 after 7.

There are warnings that inflation could spell the end of free doctors visits for under 14s as GP clinics come under increased pressure.

Just under Aderna and the Japanese Prime Minister will negotiate an information sharing agreement as New Zealand looks to strengthen its ties with Japan amidst current tensions with China.

Meanwhile cues have been forming outside the Russian embassy in Ethiopia as men volunteer to fight against Ukraine. accusing him of assault.

In sport, Blues First Five, Bowdoin Barrett says a couple weeks touring Australia is exactly what a side needs in order to mentally refresh after attacking first half of the Super Rugby season. After eight games against local opponents, the Auckland side lead the Super Rugby Pacific competition having recorded seven wins, just one loss. Now they'll embark on a two-week tour of Ozzy, a trip that Barrett hopes will reinvigorate the squad ahead of the back end of their campaign.

Shark Centre Siyo Sifa Talakai was virtually impossible to stop scoring two tries before turning provider for three others as a home side raced out to a 32 nil lead at the break.

This is King Tut by Steve Martin who performed the song on Saturday Night Live to millions watching around the world 44 years ago today. Let's take a look back on other events for the 22nd of April with this day in history. On this day in 1945, Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler admitted defeat in World War II after learning Soviet forces had broke into Berlin. On this day three years ago the Avengers end-game movie hit Hollywood Screams bringing in nearly three billion dollars worth of ticket sales and setting numerous box office records. 80 six years ago today the Rassiner Church and Labour Party sealed a historic alliance which resulted in labour holding all mildly seats in Parliament for the next 50 years. And on this day in 1823 RJ tires a fruit salesman from London painted the Rollito Rollersgate, one of the earliest known models. That was this day in history for the 22nd of April. It is now 12 minutes away from 8 o'clock. Anzac day is a time to reflect on our military history and bring attention to the sacrifices that Kiwi troops have made over the years. This year marks 100 years since the first poppy appeal was held and today we're talking to two war veterans. We're going to speak to a veteran of the war in Afghanistan shortly, but first I'm joined by Vietnam war veteran Ken Ford. Good morning. Morning. Thanks so much for coming in. My pleasure. What are you reflecting on this Anzac Day on Monday? I'm looking forward to meeting up with a lot of other vets at the Pervenuri memorial gardens where we'll have a stand to flaglaring and reef laying performance. Fantastic. Tell us about, because it was 1965 to 66, wasn't it, that you were in Vietnam. What was your job? My job was a radio operator as a Ford observer. That was one of the jobs and that job entailed if you had a contact or needed fire power. My job was to give the coordinates back to base for the guns and also the American Air Force. If we needed an APAR or whatever. That was my job. Handsome fella? Look at that photo of you there. Oh you dismissed it. Back in the day. It was quite a controversial war the Vietnam War wasn't it? At the time you know there was a lot of protest action. Were you... obviously it was difficult being there but but when you came home, how was that? When we landed at Fenurpi at midnight, we were told by an officer to get out of your uniform as quick as possible, go home, and I think we had two or three weeks leave at that time. And that was, we thought, that was a bit strange at the time. And why did you have to get out of your uniform? Well so we wouldn't be seen to be within the military. I don't know what their full reason was, but possibly because of the protesting that was going on. Yeah, did you, when people, and obviously people who knew you, knew you were in the military, what was the feeling amongst people in New Zealand at that time? How did people react to you? It was nearly talked about. I didn't even join the association for, until 20 years later. I didn't want to know, nobody knew even where I worked. I was a senior fisheries office in Christchurch. Before that I was Auckland for 10 years and a lot of people then didn't even know I was a Vietnam vet because we just never talked about it. So you've had this incredibly traumatic and bizarre experience overseas and then you're not allowed to talk about it. How was that? Hmm. Well, just let it go. Just let it go. I knew what it was about. And my mates knew what it was about. We talked together. And that was it. Yeah. I knew a feeling, really. A secret. And how does it feel now, when you look at images of the war in Ukraine, when you look at more modern wars like that? How do you react to those? We pick fault with it. I mean, that's quite a disgusting sort of episode that's going on there now. But I was a tank. I was in the tanks. And when I see the tanks rolling through the areas, and I think these people are not trained. They should be shut down inside the tank, not sitting outside the targets. That's the first thing that is me. This is the Russians. So you can tell looking at that these guys aren't properly trained. Right. Yeah. And when you see wars still happening, having been in one yourself, I mean obviously I'm fortunate enough not to have been and had to be in one. But what do you think? Sad? Waste of time. Waste of time. Yep. It's got to stop sometime. It's all over the world though, you know. Africa is happening everywhere. People just can't get on. It's not good.. Yeah. Well, thanks for coming and talking to us this morning, Ken. My pleasure. Good to see you. Now it is my birthday on the 9th of July, I'll be 80. So I expect a very small, but expensive gift from you people. All right? It'll be in the post, Ken. Thanks very much. Thank you. Have a good day on Monday. See you later. He's walking out of the studio. Oh watch your step. Watch your step. No you're all right. He's been in a war for goodness sakes. He'll be fine. V Vietnam War veteran joins us this morning. Alistair, good morning. Morning, O'Rine and thanks for having me on the show this morning. Thank you for being here. I wanted to start with the same question for you this this Anzac day on Monday. What are you reflecting on? What are you thinking about? from the poor war to especially the contemporary wars like Afghanistan and I lost a fellow com red right next to me in combat and so for me when that last post comes on I look forward to it but I don't look forward to it but I get I feel quite a lot of emotion when I hear that so whilst the services aren't obviously running as normal this year I will still be playing the last post then remembering all those four and then I've gone before us and thinking about my friend and also other friends that I lost in Afghanistan. It's Lieutenant Tim O'Donnell. Yes, correct, yeah. And that particular episode back in 2010 when the Taliban attacked, you know, the surprise attack, do you still think about that, you know, all the time now? Is it always in your mind? It's hard not to you. Now it's a traumatic event. And I think even with things like earthquakes and the terrorist incident here in Christchurch, I think people will always remember those things. It's hard not to forget any sort of trauma like that. But yeah, for me, I have a good vivid memory of it. and I think I'm re exposing myself myself to it sometimes can be helpful and make it a lot easier to get on with daily life, but it's yeah, it's definitely hard to forget it's it's always in the back of my mind. So yeah, and I'm not the only soldier out there struggling with that sort of trauma. That's exactly right. And the physical injury. Tell us about your physical injury as well. Yes, so obviously my foot was injured in an improvised from an improvised explosive device amongst, you know other things happening. I had a burnt arm as well in the flames that was going on in the vehicle. But basically my foot is still quite bad at the moment. It's suffer from chronic onset pain. So basically one day I can go around and go for a hike, but then I'll be in a lot of pain for the next two days or it might not kick in for three days later. So it's very hard to sort of manage I have to kind of work out my workload so I'm sort of you know that was 10 years ago and now the injuries injuries still impairing me but you've kind of got to move forward and unfortunately now I'm studying psychology so I'm kind of moving forward with with something towards mental health to you know, like the most of something bad that's happened to me but use it for a good purpose. Yeah, absolutely. As you said it is good to talk about the and kind of reliver I suppose to an extent to keep you know rather than you know have nightmares about it to talk about it. One thing I was reading about this morning was you your weapons when this attack happened and the the bomb went off and you was obviously you know basically on fire you went to reach for a weapon and you didn't have one. No so I mean I was a I was a heavy weapons I sort of specialized in heavy weapons and so I had a 50 kilobion machine gun and a 7.62 machine gun but basically both of them were damaged in the explosion one had one blow and clean off the turret from the blast and then the other one was pretty much half in flames or was charred I thought that might not be a wise idea to use that don't really want it going off my face so basically I was then you know vulnerable and so then my priority came to actually right what else is going on in this situation what else can I do? I'm being shot at, but there's not much I can do to shoot back. So I, you know, I realised that the rest of my comrades were in trouble and my priority came to try and help them and just hope that the rest of the team could get us out of there. And you did, but as you said, in the process you lost Lieutenant Tim O'Donnell, and that's who you'll be thinking about this weekend and on Monday and we really appreciate your time and our thoughts and prayers obviously with his family and a wider military family. Thanks so much for your time this morning we really appreciate it. I'll ask the Afghanistan War veteran there and Nelson this morning it is four minutes away from eight o'clock.

It's one past eight. Just under Adairn and the Japanese Prime Minister will negotiate an information sharing agreement as New Zealand looks to strengthen its ties with the country amidst rising tensions with China. In a joint statement, the two Prime Ministers say the arrangement is about protecting peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. International relations expert Professor Robert Patman told AM the agreement will help hold other countries accountable for international wrongdoings. This sharing of information is designed to make sure that countries which engage in unilateral actions such as China in relation to the South China Sea or Russia in relation to the Ukraine. These sort of authoritarian forces are held in check. Inflation could spell the end of free doctors' visits for under 14s as GP clinics come under increased pressure. General practice owners Association Deputy Chair Dr. Angus Chambers says it will come down to what individual doctors can manage. It's a business decision and you know I think no one would like to do that because we all value the health of our children so much. But you know I guess it comes down to calculations in the end and if you're losing money on providing a service, you have to think carefully about whether you can continue doing it. There are mixed messages from the besieged port city of Muriel Poll, as Ukraine denies Russian claims that the fight is over. President Vladimir Putin has announced victory in Muriel Pol, but Ukraine rejected the announcement, citing a surge in US military aid as a sign fighting is still very much ongoing. It comes as Russian authorities turn to Ethiopia to recruit more troops. Locals say they'll take any opportunity to leave. Life in Ethiopia is getting tougher and tougher. Inflation is rising day by day. Life is very hard here. The United States has announced a further $800 million worth of aid to support Ukraine. The UK's party gate scandal and Darling Street has escalated dramatically following an historic vote in Parliament. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will now be investigated over claims he misled MPs when he denied partying during lockdown. A police investigation into the gathering says so far issued more than 50 fines to lawmakers and their associates. UK opposition leader, Kiestama, says while Johnson had already lost the public's trust today, he lost his parties. None of his MPs wanted to vote against the Labour amendment. And I think the political mood changed today and you could feel it in the House of Commons. Speaking from his trip to India Johnson says he's not worried adding that the whole scandal is a complete waste of time. In sport, Feter and halfback Kendra Coxage is looking forward to picking the brain of rugby guru Wayne Smith following his appointment as the Blackferns director of rugby. Smith will oversee the team with less than six months to go till the rugby world cap following the shock resignation of coach Glenn Moore. The 65-year-old will have plenty of support with Sir Graham Henry to Wayne Smith both looked at our end-year tour stuff and end-year tour footage in great detail so they know what's going on in the space and we want to grab that and we want to use it because we've got to we've got to bridge that gap between us and the likes of England and France. Formula One star Lewis Hamilton and tennis great Serena Williams are among the investors backing Sir Martin Broughton's bid to buy Chelsea.

Finally at eight death-defying pilots are ramping up their training to pull off the world's first ever Mid-air plane swap. The pair will intentionally nose-dive their planes before leaving the controls jumping from one plane to the other. The planes have been given special flaps to slow them down as they barrel towards the earth at 225 kilometers per hour. The stunt will take place over the Arizona Desert on Monday. No. Why? Why? That is the latest from News Hub. It is five past eight. Let's now check in with the weather for Friday and into your long weekend. Tomorrow's weather brought you by nature turned it to power by meridian. For a lie it's not good there are severe weather watches in force for the North Island today including a heavy rain watch for Mount Taranaki lower Northland Auckland, Auckland, why cut or Coromand or Peninsula and now also for Bay of Plenty and Gersbin. Those down south tackling the Crown Range Road and Milford today be on high alert there's an orange snowfall warning in place. Having a look at the weather around the rest of the country, morning rain clears for a mostly fine afternoon in the lower south and strong southerlies died down by the season in Queensland, 13 degrees and even 14. a cloudy start on the west coast with a few showers this morning west port 19 west, west port 19, grey mouth expecting 18. on the west coast with a few showers this morning, Westport 19, Greymouth expecting 18, Canterbury and Marlborough, mostly fine day but watch out for some morning rain and gusty afternoon southerly's, Glenham 20 degrees Christchurch 16. It's a wet start for the low north with heavy rain this morning. It will die out before lunch time Wellington and Carpetty Coast expecting 20-1 for you more heavy rain for the Central Plateau as well as thunderstorms. This will ease by the afternoon. You plumb with 21 Fiyu, Topo expecting 19 degrees. Over on the East Coast, where the rain remains heavy. Downpours and thunderstorms, the sun will try to peek out, but it won't start clearing up until the evening. NAPian toadong are both 22 degrees today and to the top of the country. A lot more rain heading your way, heavy falls, and more thunderstorms. This eases just to the odd shower by the afternoon. It clears up tonight. Auckland, Tamiki Makoto, Kirikiriroa, Hamilton, both on 21 degrees. And look, can you head to your long weekend? and Zakdown Monday of course, and it's looking great with a few shards for the up and north-east and lower south-west coast, Sunday, worked along the west coast for both islands, fine elsewhere. Well poor William will be staying at home anyway because of course he found out this morning that he has COVID, he tested negative earlier this morning before he came to work and then tested positive positive. Does he though? it's a long weekend, Does he have COVID? Well you wouldn't want COVID over a long weekend you got to stay home. Yeah exactly it'd be lame. But he did turn up for work this morning so he only tested positive later when he was going to do a segment for it. I'm being mischievous. You are, it's enough from you. There's a funny survey well well I say funny, interesting survey this morning, out of Office Max. They're looking at expectations that workers have, and so it's got things like, you know, 67% say they'll only work for a company that has a positive impact on society, probably not surprising. What is surprising? Really? So like two-thirds of people say that they would only work for a company that's good for the world? Yeah, some kind of positive impacts. Really? So like you wouldn't work at BP or I probably shouldn't say that. Well they have a station and they have a lot of environmental innovations going on at BP. They're pumping gas, I mean, and the minds of some people that would be that would be dangerous territory I would think. That's a fair thing. You know? Anyway that's interesting. Not as I get into the specifics of companies. But a lot of people say that what is really important to them is workplace benefits and in particular 54% of people said an unlimited supply of hot beverages. That's you Ben. That's number one on your priority list of work places. But good beverages. Can I try that? But 40% of people said that free childcare was important to them. Oh yeah. What work workplaces are offering free childcare? Well croishes I suppose. If you were if you worked at a croche would they give you free baby care? If you worked there. Yeah. You probably still have to play percentage. Yeah. 44% say a gym membership. But it made me wonder are you receiving workplace benefits other than child care gym membership? Is there anything unusual that you get at your workplace? Or what is important to you? Well, I get, I know I get, what I get with my workplaces is great conversations from these two.

Right, 16 minutes after 8 o'clock now. Super rugby magic kicks off this evening. The event being the first of its kind in the league. The Super Round will operate like the NRL Magic Ground, giving rugby fans the chance to watch every team in the Super Rugby in the Super rugby competition at the same ground over 72 hours and bringing us all the coverage from Melbourne is news hub rugby reporter Ollie Ritchie Ollie good morning to you good morning male how's it going very good it's a super early morning for you so thanks for getting up for us right are you picking any surprises this weekend because of course it's the first time we're going to see that Trans-Tasmine rivalry. So what should we be looking out for? Yeah, I think there'll be some crackers to be honest, Malin. A lot of the storylines in the narrative heading into this weekend is just how dominant the Ki-we teams are and how the competition really needs those Australian teams to get some wins. and I think we will see them I think in that Brumbies Highlanders game is probably where we'll see one the Brumbies at the top Australian team the Highlanders have struggled this year down south and the bottom New Zealand team the Highlanders have struggled this year down south and the bottom New Zealand team and the the bottom New Zealand team and the L bottom New Zealand team and they're the bottomed in an upset because the Brumbies have actually been playing really well so I think there's a couple of chances in this round to see those Australian teams get up and I think you'll want to see that in the competition because as much as the Kiwi fans probably want to continue seeing Kiwi dominance no competition is great when it's just completely one-sided so I think for the good of the competition some of those Ozzy teams really need to step up I think we'll see a couple of them this weekend. In terms of the fans over there, they're probably likely to get in behind the Pacific teams right? Well, feed you and draw at least because Maulana Pacifica have had their game postponed again. They can't catch a break and they melt. It's such a shame for them because when they do play, they play great rugby and they show just why they deserve a spot in this competition and through no fault of their own they continuously have their games postponed. It will be postponed their match against the Western Force unfortunately an outbreak of COVID in the force camp so that game will be pushed back a little later on in the competition but yeah they can't catch a break I saw a Sikorpikupu yesterday down at Amy Park. He's over here already it's just such a shame they haven't really been able to get it going this year because of all those disruptions. It will be played again. Unfortunately, it just won't be in this magic round, which is a real shame for them. The rescheduling headaches continue, Oli. It's Bernadine here. I just want to say I've watched the the magic round for NR for NRail. It is the most kind kind of festival atmosphere and the Ozys really embrace it. Do you think they're going to embrace the rugby union side of it in this kind of format over there? Well this is going to be the big test, isn't it, Bernie, because rugby union isn't the number one sport in Australia like it is in New Zealand and the NRL very much rules, as is the AFL here in Melbourne. So you can see why the NRL has had a lot of success with it. This will be a real litmus test for Super Rope. Can they market this competition well enough? Have they marketed this round well enough to get people in behind it? to get people in behind it. Open borders at the moment of course. Flights and aren't easy. I wouldn't expect too many traveling in, but hopefully people's playing the Crusaders playing the Crusaders. people in Melbourne will get behind it. It's a big sporting city as you know they love their Ozzy rules here, they love their Melbourne storm, they've got the Melbourne Rebels playing the Crusaders on Sunday evening so a massive match for them. It'll be a real test for the Super Rugby marketers. Have they done a good enough job to get people to the stands over the weekend? Because selfishly it would be something that New Zealand would just lap up. This would be a great event to hold here. Can you have a little quiet word and see if we can get it shimmed over here for next time? Well I think that's a great point and a great opportunity for franchises to put their hands up to host. You know you picture Eden Park, a festival of rugby over the weekend, all teams in Auckland. You'd like to think the Kiwis would really get behind it, even down in Wellington potentially or down in Dunedin. The timing would be really crucial. I think it needs to be played at the start of the super-rapy season. That way you avoid any clashes with the NRL and the AFL over here. You soak up the last of that summer. I know they intended to play it at the start of the start of this season. obviously, and the border closures and COVID made that difficult so I think going forward you'll see this round push to the start of the super rugby season get more people in behind it change up the up the locations take it all over the show and hopefully turn it into a really special weekend of rugby. Hey Ollie we're talking about perks of the job this morning it's our talk of this morning have you got any per... I suppose actually with you being in Melbourne and you loving rugby so much, that's a perk of the job. Yeah that's a pretty good perk of the job being able to come to Melbourne and cover things like this. I got like one of those little iPhones like you were talking about before Ryan which is pretty cool but I'd say coming to spots like Melbourne for work, you know I feel very fortunate to be able to be able to go around the place and cover these call events and you know do it all for as part of your job is pretty special so that's a pretty decent perk already plus we've got pretty good pretty good coffee at TV 3. So I hear a news hub, rugby reporter Ali Ritchie, thanks very much. Team trip, team bonding, where is the coffee that he's talking. Oh you get a coffee every morning?

Good morning, good morning, believe it or not, there is a city hiding under there, it's Auckland. Rainy though, it should clear this afternoon, it's taking 25 minutes from the airport into the city and Hellensville to the city, 39 minutes, look at it, go, traffic updates thanks to our partner battery zone, your local battery expert. And there are presenters under here as well. Good morning. Great to have you with us. It's time for our panel of the day now at 25 after 8. We're joined by lawyer Marie Dieberg. Good morning. And nano girl lab CEO Joe Davis. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. ramrides and youth defending and said we need this. Police would say why don't we have a special law that is for an exceptional small proportion of young people that have done multiple crimes that means that we can do home detention, that means that we can actually have extra checks on them, that we can make sure that they're actually where they're supposed to be and not where they're not, and give them some extra powers for a very few select under a strict criteria. Marie you're a lawyer what's wrong with that idea or what's right with him? Unfortunately Paula has not kept up with the law because what she is advocating is some new law is already in place. You have e. in bail and support a bail already for youth offenders. So there's no law change needed. What you have to do is look at how it's an operation at the moment for these troubled youth. Well, it's obviously not working because the police tell us that they're locking, they're going out one night, they're arresting, these youth offenders, and the next night they're out again doing the same things. out one night, they're arresting these youth offenders and the next night they're out again doing the same thing. That's exactly right. And of course the big stick never works and you've got to have the restrictions in place but you have to have the support. When you have to have the support, when you think of the youth offenders we are really looking at a lot of them are coming from overcrowded and impoverished places. I agree with you and I know we need to look at those long-term issues but in the meantime Joe we have dairy owners and we have jewellery store owners who are literally petrified even in daylight now. So what do we do in the short term? I think there's no question that we want to stop it in the short term and that we want to see a police a police presence able to do that. we work in a company that they're already Am I right when she says the laws that they need to do that sound like they're already in place. Look, what we work in a company that's about creating educational opportunity, what I can tell you is that the answer to these problems is a long-term problem. It is a complex issue. The question is what could we have done ten years earlier, not really what do we need to do today? If the law is there though, are these cases actually getting to court? Because court numbers have been going down, but is that just trying to muddy the court figures and trying to keep youth out of court? The youth aid referrals are there. What we have to do, and think of what you just said, Joe, is police presence, community workers on the streets, but you have to work with the families, you can't just work with the offenders and you've got to get these kids, you can identify them way earlier than that, you know, we're waiting till the 15 and then... Well, interesting you say that because there was the idea of, Bill English's idea for intervening very very early on right social investment it was called. One family at a time Bill used to say right one family at a time great idea. Time we brought that idea back? Absolutely and that's what's missing you've got to bring the cultural values into the family of these offenders so if you're Marty or your Pacifica or you're a sort of pakiha, bring in and pay the, you know, for example, komatwa, bring in the social workers, work with the families as well, put it back on the schools and say, do not kick these kids out at 10. You front up and do your juicy, because you cannot isolate them either. or. and do your juicy because you cannot isolate them either. Let's talk about, sorry, let's talk about values of a different kind. Changing tack a week, but to workplace benefits and whether you have any workplace benefits, Joe, you work with your wife. And could there be a better benefit? That's what I'd say. The great hashtag blessed, right? The great privilege of getting up every day and working with my dear wife. Honestly for me, always run my own company so there's not the soda fountains and the unlimited beverages or whatever else. What I love is going to work every day and knowing we're making a difference. Do you offer anything to your staff, any little extra perks, hot beverages? There's an amazing little cafe around the corner from us in Ponsonby where they are very welcome to have a coffee on us any time. But honestly, the chance to actually work with purpose and make a difference in a team that cares for you is a pretty good benefit. Yes, we do the bonding, but I've always maintained time off. Don't pretend you're sick and I push and push my people that I work for is go on holiday take time take a long weekend wake up one morning and feel like I just want to be with family and friends and do shopping and just basically I'm tired I want a day off I believe in time off and I have done that for years and years and a mental health time and absolute part we don't keep a record there's no record, so it's not like you have X amount of days. Take the time. Are you hiring? You say yes. We'll all come and work. We're fully flexy time and locations and all the things. We're fully flexy time and locations and all the things. It's great for if you can do that., obviously if you can get? Mine's on Max but it has to be it looks small on me. Size of the brick. Yes. Actually yeah do you want to hold this phone? You're even bigger than I. It's just thumb and forefinger. I don't even know how you use it. I come and work for us honestly. It's tiny. Thank you both. Thank you both so much for coming for coming on.. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you guys so much for coming on the show. Thanks for having us. Great to have you with us. lawyer Marie Diaberec and then a girls lab. CEO Joe Davis, thank you very much. It's 831 and time for the news. Morning and a good morning. It is as Mel said 29 to 9. Just Sandra Dern and the Japanese Prime Minister will negotiate an information sharing agreement as New Zealand looks to strengthen its ties with the country amidst rising tensions with China. In a joint statement, the two Prime Ministers say the arrangement is about protecting peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. International Relations expert Professor Robert Patman told AM the agreement will help hold other countries accountable for international wrongdoings. This sharing of information is designed to make sure that countries which engage in unilateral actions such as China in relation to the South China Sea or Russia in relation to the Ukraine. So these sort of authoritarian forces are held in check. Officials will today return to Rokai Huts to assess the damage caused by flash flooding overnight. Heavy rain in the South Island was too tough for the Rekhi River mouth to handle with around five households facing water damage. Kevin Elfield, speaking on behalf of local civil defence, says the deluge came so quickly there was no warning. The old shop that's covered but they can't get the water run out of that. And there's two or three others here that have got it, one just here. One bedroom is flooded in their land, they're going to sleep the spare room. The one on the far end, it's wet, but they're sleeping upstairs. Meanwhile motorists are being warned of a large slip, which has forced the closure of State Highway 6 on the west coast. Three wide tarkily ranges walking tracks will open today, reopen after being shut off for four years. In 2018, the tracks were closed while mitigation work could be completed, bringing them up to safe standard for kodhi trees. Auckland Mayor Phil Goff says the spread of coe die back in the ranges needed to be taken seriously and the closure helped to slow the spread of the disease. The tracks reopening today took over the Tasman Sea and passed through Pija Beach. Ukraine is fighting back Russian claims that the besieged port city of Marupol has fallen. Vladimir Putin has declared victory in the city, where fighting has seen the death and displacement of thousands. But in an address to the World Bank, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski says the fighting is far from over. We are renewing transportation lines, building up temporary bridges on the rivers. Active combat action is going on. Russia is still trying to build up a new and atrocious offensive operation. Meanwhile Russia has turned to Ethiopia to recruit more fighters with people lining up at the embassy to enroll. The man fighting Scott Morrison to be Australia's next Prime Minister has tested positive for COVID. Australia's opposition leader Anthony Albanese has been on the campaign trail ahead of the country's federal elections in May. He tested positive during a regular PCR test late last night. Albanese says it's a bit a blow but he'll continue campaigning from home while isolating. In sport New Zealand football has confirmed a blockbuster international friendly for the all-wights which is said to be played ahead of the World Cup intercontinental playoff the Kiwis will take on South American side Peru in early June at Barcelona, which will be followed by a behind-closed all-up match against another team. Both games will form part of the All-Wites preparation ahead of their World Cup playoff match against Costa Rica, with that game taking place on June 15. Its official IX boss Erika Tenhag has been appointed as Manchester United's new manager. The 52-year-old will replace interim coach Ralph Rangnik at the end of the season on a three-year deal. Tenhag will become United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. That was back in 2013. 13. Worry's coach, Nathan Brown is refusing to offload the blame for his team's loss to the Sydney Roosters last weekend. The Kiwi side were on the verge of or the receiving end of its marginal calls from the referees which resulted in the club slipping to a 22-14 defeat against the Roosters. But Brown wouldn't point the fingerprint official saying he's still not ready to let his team off the hook than easily. Our main focus has got to be on, you know, as a coaching staff, what could we do better last week and what can we do better going forward and the players need to look at, you know, how can I do it better, what can I be better, how can I be better, how can I prepare better, how can I play better? That's the very latest from Newshub. Let's now take a look at the weather for Friday. Bill has COVID. I don't so I'm going to do it for you and let's also look into head to the long weekend. There are a severe weather brought you by nature. There are severe weather watches by Meridian. There are severe weather watches in the North Island today including a heavy rain watch for Mark Taranaki, lower Northland Auckland or Kaurauke, or Coromandelle, and Bay of Plenty in Gisbin. That's pretty much everyone. Those down the south, tackling the crown range in Milford roads, be on alert there's an orange snowfall warning in place. Moving on to the weather for the motto, morning rain clears for a mostly fine afternoon in the lowest south and strong sardherlies, die down by the evening in the evening in Queen in Queen Queen, Queen Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queenstown 13, to need a little warmer on 14 degrees. Cloudy on the west coast, few showers in the morning, West Port, 19, gray mouth, 18, candorberry and Marlborough. Mostly fine day, but watch out for some morning rain, gusty afternoon southerlies. Blenham expect 20 degrees, Christchurch, or the Tahay 16. It's a wet start for the low north. Heavy rain this morning will die out before lunchtime, Wellington and Carpetey coast 20 degrees. There is more heavy rain for the central plateau as well as thunderstorms. This will ease by the afternoon. New Plymouth, 21-footope or 19 degrees expected. And on the east coast where the rain remains heavy. Downpaws and thunderstorms, the sun will try and peek out at some stage, won't start clearing going until the evening. Napier and Todong are both 22 and to the top of New Zealand you have a lot more rain headed your way. Heavy falls and thunderstorms. This eases to the old Chaba the afternoon and clears tonight Hamilton and Auckland both 21. Looking ahead your long weekend, Saturday it's looking grey. a few showers for the up and east and the last southwest coasts. Sunday. A little wet along the west coast for both islands but fine elsewhere. Do be careful on the road that's long weekend. Keep it nice and easy. Absolutely, thanks very much Benadine and thank you for writing in with your workplace benefits. Lots of you have written into us. This is in response to a survey which found that 54% of people said workplace benefits was really important to them. Most of all, unlimited supply of hot beverages. But a lot of your workplaces go much further than that. Karen says at her work, she gets six well-being days off a year, $300 for personal well-being, so germ or shoes, fortnightly massages, and unlimited supply of breakfast, cereal, little delights of Easter eggs and things. Where's Karen working? It's fortnightly massages. I mean first of all nice to hear a Karen saying something positive. Did you have to go there? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Where did she work? Does she say? No, she doesn't say. At home probably. We'll get back to work. That's intense. Xavier says my work pays for my personal mobile plan, but I am always worried they contract how many times I visit seek.co.org on social media during work. I thought you were going to say another website. I thought yeah, I wouldn't be doing that. Which one? Well you know, adult one. Yeah, also a shout out, don't you? A shout out to Bill who is watching from Fiji, and says, I watch you live every day from Pacific, however, that's a perk of my work, and I get to take a nap when my daughter takes his. So a shout out to Bill and Fiji and also to all of our viewers across the Pacific and the Cook Islands too if you're watching. Thanks very much. And indeed around the entire world. Great to have you watching this morning. I tell you what, we are going to get to more of your pork perks shortly. I have an update from William who has COVID. He sent me a text.

It is quarter to nine and we are going to check in with our reporters this morning. Let's check in with Auckland first to Tier MacDoole. Tier, there is a tiger at the zoo. Yeah, I'm just continuing the theme of Earth Day today. Auckland has welcomed a tiger to Auckland so for the first time in three years. from this weekend.. you can head along and meet Salli, the Sumatrain. Sali has travelled up from Hamilton to Auckland's a part of Auckland's global breeding programme that they contribute to. The Sumachrin Tiger is from Indonesia and they are critically endangered. There's only about 400 left in the world, but it's a very good thing that Salli is up in Auckland. She's going to have a brand new enclosure, and then a couple months' time Auckland Zoo is hoping to bring in some male tigers, so hopefully later this year we can have the same conversation about some tiger cubs. That would be amazing. The new enclosure looks really cool. I spent a lot of time at the zoo, so I would know. Thanks very much Tia. Now we're going to head to Mitch, Christchurch. Mitch, good morning. Yeah, good morning. Good morning, good morning Ryan, how are you? Good morning Mel. Good, thanks mate. Have you got an update for us from Christchurch this morning? I do, it's actually on Queenstown. Yesterday the weather brought the plenty of lightning and thunder and and thunder and bad weather and it's kind of continuing today. Snowfall is expected in parts of Queenstown. Now it's thought to be a Met Service has issued a road snowfall warning which is thought to be the first this year and could bring a wee sprinkling of snow to the top parts of the Crown Range. Now the Crown Range is a dangerous road at the best of times let let alone on a long weekend right in the middle of school holidays. So Met Services are asking motorists just to take care and drive nice and carefully over that road. Brilliant. All right, so it's just gone quarter to nine o'clock now. We're going to let here go, and we're going to stay with Mitch. because Mitch, it was about a year for the weekend to visit a today actually, almost this weekend, that you were living in Auckland, you just gone to Christchurch for the weekend to visit your family, and we're going to play a video of what happened. You were driving from Auckland Airport, you've just been in Christchurch to see the fam and you were driving home and this happened. And that was our Mitch in that car. Mitch, what happened mate? First of all right I feel a bit silly talking about myself I got into this job to tell the news not actually be it but here we are I'd been in crisis for the weekend and had been working actually with the AM show at the time probably had a wee bit of lack of sleep with those three a.m wake-ups also had a friends 21st down here so there was a wee bit of drinking as well and supposedly the two don't go very well together and yeah I had a bit of a seizure on my drive home from the airport which meant no driving for a year so I'm bloody stoked to be honest to have my license back it's brilliant. Yeah and we do want to say that it was it was asked that forced that forced force this on you to force this on you. We wanted to force this on you. We wanted to force this on you. was us that forced this on you we wanted to talk to you about it because we saw it on your on your Instagram page so you basically you have this seizure while you're driving and then you can't drive for a whole year and you've just got your license back now during that time what did you do to get around? Yeah it was difficult at times and I was lucky to have sort of mom and dad's health and plenty of friends as well. I know they're all stoked that I'm back driving and not complaining about it anymore but there was yeah plenty of Uber, Uber rides, a bit of public transport too but then of of course lockdown happened while I was living in Wellington sort of August September last year which made getting around even more difficult from where I was in upper heart. so it was voluntarily an expensive year getting around but it's all good I'm fine everyone else was fine and I'm driving again so yeah it's one of those things though because we were starting to talk to other people about you know their experiences with having accidents and things and then they're having to pay to get around which is something we we we thought ACC might cover so we're interested to hear from people who might have been in a similar similar situation. much but but you're all good now and you've got your license back and you're back behind the world which is fantastic and hopefully not too embarrassed to talk about yourself. No, it's um yeah great to be back and I know I've got I have plenty of friends rides around Christchurch so that that will be coming their way very very soon I hope and hopefully no more crasheses. Mitch did you find out about the seizure itself and how common that is? in hospital a couple of hours later, but one of the first things I do remember was the doctor or the specialist that is saying that apparently it's super common for 18 to 21 year old blocks to actually have a one-off seizure, not with epilepsy or anything, but just literally a one-off seizure, but just literally a one-off seizure, but just literally a one-off seizure, and never have another one again. there on just how many people are having it but yeah the fact that the hospital mentioned it must say that it does actually happen quite common and there's plenty of other people around in the same situation. Right interesting well we're very glad you're able to get back behind the wheel and you're all well and thanks very much for talking with us this morning about it. Match our Christchurch AM reporter. Right Newshub live at 1130 is here later this morning and here here to tell us what's coming up is the lovely Alice Wilkins.

It's hard for an actor to get into character sometimes but a lot easier when the actor is the character. Nicholas Cage stars in a new release the unbearable weight of massive talent as Nicholas Cage. as Nicholas Cage but a fictionalised version of the unbearable weight of massive talent as Nicholas Cage, but a fictionalised version of himself. So he's here to tell us more as News Hub's entertainment editor, Kate Roger, Kate. This looks funny. It is so great, this film. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. I'm a huge Nick Cage fan, way back to Conair, whether it's Conair, whether it's the rock, raising Alabama, he's had an amazing career. He has played some Oscar worthy and in fact has won an Oscar for leaving Las Vegas. And then he went through the stage in his life where he took literally every role that was offered to him because he got a bit excited when he won his Oscar and bought like 17 properties all around the world. He had to pay his bills. He forgot to pay his taxes. So he literally said yes to every role that came his way. But he's turned into this cult kind of figure. And the idea and the notion that he would be cast in a film to play himself as an actor that is run out of money and has to take a million bucks to sort of show it as super fan's birthday party, it just feels so perfectly self-self-deprecating and so real and so funny. Petro Pascal pays Harvey who is his Spanish super fan but there's potential for him to be a bad guy and the CIA is following him around. And so Nick Cage has to become all his versions of all his different characters in order to help the CIA. It's so tricky. It's such a perfect description Mel because it's essentially two unknown filmmakers that wrote the script sent it to Nick Cage and he's like nah he said no four times he told me and then he got this beautiful letter from the filmmaker and he thought oh look what the heck I'm gonna do it and I'm not I'm not lying this is a five-star classic perfect cultish comedy that everyone's loving. It was a 100 on rotten tomatoes a couple of days. So it's's just one of those. He's just, you know how there was the McConosomps when Matthew McConaughey playing the actor everybody wanted to cast. I feel like we're getting Nick Cage back again and after his amazing film pig you'll remember pig. I'm sorry please you say that because he's he's weaky. He's not taking the Mickey out of him. He's so bonkers but he can he can he can he can he can he can he can he can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can't. He can. He can't. He can. He can. He can. He can. He can. He can. He can. He can. He can. He connects. He's so good. He is and he's passionate about film and it shows in this because it's not taking the Mickey out of who he is. It's actually, but it is, sorry I'm not describing it very well because he's art. It's just, but just not as we know. You have to have to have to have a look because... You have to have a lot. But it's just hugely entertaining, so I really recommend it for the long weekend. Neil Patrick Harris is also in it. And I said to my husband, I said, when I say Neil Patrick Harris, what do you think of instantly? And he said, well, if you're an older person, you'd think doogie-houser. And if you're younger, you'd think doogie-houser. And if you're younger, you movie Gone Girl, oh my God. No he has the capacity but he's actually got much more range than I ever thought and he's and he's and do he houses can I just say though my mind was drifting he's playing we noticed no no no but he's playing himself in a movie right? Yeah, nook cages and so he's talented but he's playing himself but he's playing himself this is the argument that the Kardashian family himself in a movie, right? That cages. Yeah, that cages. And so he's talented, but he's playing himself. This is the argument that the Kardashian family has always made. That they don't have talent, but they're always themselves. So he's now trying to make money out of playing himself. Is he just a Kardashian? Wow. You were really letting your mind wander there. I love having him. I love having him. That's not John Milkovich. Not let him do anything. A little bit being John Milkovich, anything. Sure, John Milkovich. Yeah. That's where I've been for the last three minutes. Yeah, no, I was aware. Somewhere else. I was just kind of glaze over and he looks like five minutes has plenty thank you. What else should we watch? Also out of range has just landed on neon and it's Josh Brolin who is outstanding and for me this TV show was the two things I love the most which is a Western but just what the heck there's a huge hole at the back of the of the range and is it is it is there something alien about it is it time travel is it his imagination? it is and it just gets? Is it his imagination? It is, and it just gets more and more juicy and complex with each episode, and I want to see Josh Brollin over 8 EPS. It's not enough in no country for old men, and he just holds this all together as he tries to protect his family. There's quite a bit of murder, and when I say that it's not for the kids, obviously, obviously, murder. is family. There's quite a bit of murder and when I say that it's not for the kids obviously murder generally isn't for the record and it's just... Or adults sometimes. Sometimes. Yeah, maybe but let's not let Ryan think about that for the next time. Yes, about murdering the kids. Yes it's a school holiday so let's not go there. Those thoughts do cross ones might. anyway, um anyway now my... go there. Those thoughts do cross ones mind. Anyway now, my eyes are glacial. Anyway, out of range is your binge recommendation for me for the long weekend. Where do you watch it? On your TV. Okay. No, it's on neon, sorry. Who watches binging on their TV anymore? Either on your device or on your television, but it's a it's now and it's brilliant. Thank you Kate. Entertaining as always. Edit, edit, even. Kate Roger. You should try watching a movie on that. Where's your microscope? That's what I've been doing lately. I was watching Netflix on this. All right, well thank you. That was very good. This is nearly the end of the program. It is a Friday before a long weekend So whatever you're doing this weekend, we hope that you stop and you reflect on our veterans and the service that they have given to this country But also take some time to enjoy your family and all that sort of stuff as well. Yeah, take some time out and drive safe. Thanks very much for joining us on a. A. We're back with AM early on Tuesday from 530. Kakitiano. See you on. See you next Tuesday.
