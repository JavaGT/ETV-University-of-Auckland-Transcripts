It's where they had the gladiators fighting. Oh, no. Okay, so a few years ago, a few years ago, that's it, that's it. And it looks like a whole lot of arches all the way around in a big circle. It is? A ruin, well done. Now, somebody a few years ago said a computer model of how to evacuate the Coliseum in the event of a fire, and they paralleled it with the Evac scheme for the Bird's Nest Stadium, which is in Beijing that was used for the Olympics. And it turned out that they could evacuate the Coliseum really, really quickly. And because somebody back then had been a fire engineer and had thought about how they were going to get everybody out. Now, the fire engineer will have had to think about all of this. And in fact, fire engineers did get together and put together a schemes document for New Zealand, which means there are rules around running lock concerts. There are rules around how many people you can cram in. There are rules around how you have to get them out. And with the very last person approaching the exit perimeter for both stadiums, it's time to stop the clock and see which one has performed best. For the Coliseum... Let's check the time. 12 minutes, 44 seconds. Yeah. I hate to say it. I hate to say it, Steve. And for the bird's nest. Oh! 12 minutes 57. You can't do that to me. I want a rerun. I want a rerun. That's not fair. You can't do that to me. I want a rerun. I want a rerun. That's not fair. Unbelievably in the ultimate stadium test of evacuation, the Coliseum has beaten Steve's Bird's Nest Stadium. I'm astonished. I mean, I'm astonished when we've run the analysis, but actually looking at the Coliseum, as we've said all along, it looks like a great stadium. So, you know, visually, it looks right. And then when we test it, it is right. So Roman engineers, well done."}
