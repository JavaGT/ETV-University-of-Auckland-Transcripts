The Reserve Bank lifts the official cash rate again, why some homeowners are now looking to break and refix their mortgage rates. Carmilla Harris speaks at the Pacific Islands Forum, but Fiji in chief wants real action on climate change. And Riko Yuani on what the all blacks need more of and what played a major part in their loss in Dunedin. Thank you, all, good evening. Police were given a stack of new tools to tackle gangs today, including a new offence of firing a gun to intimidate with a jail term of up to five years. The government's been called soft on crime after two feuding gangs shot at a number of homes in Auckland, and youth offenders committed a series of ram raids. It cost Porto Williams her job as police minister and her replacement Chris Hipkins said today we want to hit gangs where it hurts. Police will get expanded search powers and more opportunities to impound cars and motorbikes. And to crack down on money laundering, cash won't be able to be used to buy cars, boats, expensive watches and jewellery. Political reporter Amelia Wade has more. House after house shot up in a gang war. West Auckland knows it well. Don't feel very safe for the children walking out and about and for ourselves. It is getting out of hand. Look at what's been happening lately with the killer bees and the tribesmen. And hopefully the government, you know, step up and do something about it, eh? Enter the government's new law and order duo, cracking on with cracking down on gangs. I don't just want to drive the gangs underground and then say that's the problem solved. We want to drive their criminal activity out of the community completely. Hitting them where it hurts. We're going after guns, vehicles and cash. They've spent a month listening to police and are keen to give them new search and seizure powers and are closing a legal loophole. What's going on is that if you have a person who's shooting at a house with the intent to intimidate, yes, you can charge them under a summary offences for intimidation. The maximum penalty? Three months. I don't think New Zealanders would be satisfied with that. So they want to make it illegal to intimidate someone by shooting at them, including warning shots to ward off trespasses. If you are going out with the intent to intimidate any person with a gun and discharging it at them. And it will be credit or debit only for expensive blingin' boats. The minister's clearly listening and they're looking to take some action. And some of these things will have a real impact very quickly once those laws are passed. Lifetime black power member and community advocate, Dennis O'Reilly, says rubbish to that. I was disappointed that it was so shallow. He says the law changes are only there to make the government look tough on crime. Dumb policy is based on prejudice and jumping to conclusions. Smart policy is based on evidence. And we are not taking a breath and gathering the evidence. The Green Party agrees. A knee-jerk reaction, not based on evidence, they will not address the underlying causes of offending. The ministers not getting support from their left, but are getting it from their right. We will support them. They frankly don't go far enough. The law's landing in the middle politically, while Auckland stuck in the middle of gang crossfire. Okay, Amelia, so when will these law changes be made? Yeah, Mike, well, these changes announced today are an immediate response to, A, the rising gang tensions that we've seen recently, but also B, to soften the-crime calls coming from the opposition. We'll likely see these come in in August or at least in the next couple of months and having national on board will help their easing through Parliament. But what is going to take more time is the top of the cliff stuff, the stopping of the recruiting to the gangs, stopping children from joining gangs. Both ministers say that they are acutely aware that prevention is the best tool in the toolbox and so they're expecting more work to come on that. Absolutely. Amelia Wade, live from Parliament in Wellington, thanks very much. We've had another stark reminder of who our most vulnerable are in the COVID pandemic, the elderly. 20 of the 29 reported to have died with COVID today were over the age of 80. And of the total 1,737 people with COVID who have died in the pandemic so far, 60% of them were over 80. The second wave of Omicron is well and truly upon us, with 11,464 new community cases reported today. And 729 people are in hospital. That is an increase of 19 since yesterday. The Reserve Bank has lifted the official cash rate by 50 basis points for the third time in a row in an effort to slow inflation. Some homeowners are now looking at breaking their mortgage rates early and refixing to avoid a higher interest rate down the line. Zane Small has a story. Buying a home is notoriously out of reach for many Kiwis, and with interest rates up again, the goalposts have moved again. It will actually affect me quite a lot. Just have to be realistic about what you can buy. The Reserve Bank announced today it had increased the official cash rate to 2.5% as spending and investment demand continues to outstrip supply. The central bank said it will continue to lift the OCR until inflation is within its target range of 1 to 3%. Inflation is currently at 6.9%. The most popular mortgage term is one year these days and it's now almost a year since the Reserve Bank started hiking interest rates and those mortgage rates started to move. So there wouldn't be too many borrowers now who haven't either already been affected or who are expecting to be. One of them is 21-year-old Liam Patton, who, like many first-home buyers, has never known an interest rate outside of 2%. At the moment, my interest rates fixed till next year at 2.95%. So looking at a potential doubling of my interest rate is, like, scary. It's going to be maybe about 700 bucks, a week extra. He's now considering breaking his mortgage rate early and refixing it now to avoid a more painful hike down the line. Advice he's taken from his dad, Bruce, who's a mortgage advisor. We've had a lot of inquiry about, is it worth me breaking now and fixing it? It really comes down to if your loans coming due probably this side of Christmas, it's worth thinking about. If it's due next year, then realistically you're probably better to wait. Making matters worse is rising food costs. Statsn Z data out today shows grocery prices are up 7.6% compared to the same time last year. The Reserve Bank's lifting of the official cash rate is one of its main tools to curb inflation. What we hope is that we don't see them go too far the other way and push the rates up too high. An uncertain time for first home owners and hopefuls no longer having the advantage of the early pandemic error interest rates. Zane Small News Hub. US Vice President Kamala Harris has addressed Pacific leaders in what seen as a masterstroke from America amidst its geostrategic competition with China. But the chief of a small Fijian village is asking, where's the real action on climate change? Climate correspondent, Isabel Ewing, has a story. A short drive from Suva, the village of Veva to Loa. Here, climate change is a human rights issue. The creeping oceans forced more than 20 families out of their homes. You can look around. There's a lot of landslide taken by sea. It couldn't feel further from where the Pacific leaders are meeting to discuss the region's future. Village headman Suani Rauto says there's no future here. Raising of the water level is much higher than before. Just down the road, the jostling for influence in the Pacific ramping up. The United States muscling into the Pacific Islands Forum in an unprecedented move for a non-member, invited by Chair Frank Bainimarama, taking other leaders by surprise. Bulang and welcome. In the back row, eyes and ears from the Chinese Embassy, who weren't invited. In April, China Inc. a security pact with the Solomon Islands and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi toward the Pacific seeking similar agreements, and now the U.S. striking back. In recent years, the Pacific Islands may not have received the diplomatic attention and support that you deserve. So today I am here to tell you directly, we are going to change that. Rolling out a counter-offer to Beijing's... We will embark on a new chapter in our partnership, a chapter with increased American presence. Including opening new embassies in Tonga and Kedibas, developing a Pacific strategy for the first time in history and a better deal for Pacific nations in exchange for fishing in their waters. We plan to triple US funding. Harris saying that funding will contribute to climate resilience. But it's not guaranteed. It needs approval from Congress. Jacinda Ardern saying it's safe to assume the United States commitment includes climate action. It is the number one issue for this region and I think no one's under any illusion that that is where the focus is. But Pacific people don't feel the focus is there. You didn't consult the villages. So the Pacific bidding war between China and the US is on but for those dealing with the impact of the climate crisis now it's the same old talk talk talk no action. Well Isabelle joins us now from Suva. Isabel, any reaction from Beijing yet on Carmelah Harris' appearance at the forum? Well, Sam, we haven't seen any official reaction from Beijing just yet. But as you saw in that story, the Chinese government certainly has people on the ground here, keeping an ear and an eye to developments despite not being invited. And it is likely that China feels aggrieved at being excluded given the meeting of foreign partners, which includes the US, India and China, was cancelled in advance. And so really, if Kamala Harris is getting the call up, perhaps it would have been fair to extend an invite to Chinese foreign minister Wang Ye as well. But despite the absence of Chinese leaders and officials here in Suva in the official meetings, it is, you can bet that China and its power plays here in the Pacific will feature prominently in discussions and debate among leaders tomorrow. Namahe, Isabel, thanks so much. Shocking new evidence has emerged of the massacre that took place inside an elementary school in Yuvalde, Texas. Its security camera video obtained by news outlets who removed the sound of children screaming as the shooter moved among them. But we should warn you what's still in the video is both distressing and its fueling parents' anger. CBS's Janet Shamline reports. For the first time, we're seeing the horrifying moments the gunman entered Rob Elementary and Yuvaldi. The gunman walking down an empty hallway, stopping to fire into classrooms. A student spots the shooter as he rounds a corner and then runs away. Three minutes later, the first police enter the building. They're shot it by the gunman and they run away. The video released by the Austin American statesman then jumps to 19 minutes later. Now there's an even larger and more heavily armed police presence, but still, no entry to the classrooms or the gunman fired more than 100 rounds, killing 19 children and two teachers. It is difficult to watch. For long periods of time, officers stand in the hallway. One officer walking over to a wall-mounted hand sanitizer in the midst of the carnage. At 77 minutes into the edited video, the breach is made into the classroom, and a barrage of gunfire can be heard. The release has been part of a fight between numerous government officials and agencies, including the Yuvalde District Attorney, who opposed it. Those calling for its release, including victims' families, hoped it would help explain the delayed response and why officers put their own safety ahead of those of the children. But tonight, it has only raised more questions. Police have recovered the body of a person after the car they were in was swept away by floodwaters in Dunedin last night. Two more people were also in the car when it attempted to cross a Ford through Silverstream in North Tair. Kasha Brownley reports. Flood waters surging from relentless heavy rainfall. Late last night, a car with three occupants tried to cross Silver Stream River in North Tairi. Sadly, one person died. It's heartbreaking news to wake up to... It's a challenging waterway, and we made the call early yesterday afternoon to close that road. Graham Gale helped facilitate the rescue. When we got on the scene it was, you know, obviously dark and raining and low cloud and we actually ended up winching one of our water rescue personnel down onto the vehicle. This area of North Tairi is known for its dangerous conditions. Well, there's no lights around actually in that particular area. onto the vehicle. This area of North Tairiri is known for its dangerous conditions. There was no lights around actually in that particular area. And, you know, you're working with the elements. And, you know, we're only a few hundred feet off the ground and the cloud was just literally just above us. We always go out there with trying to make a difference and preserve life. And sadly, last night, that wasn't to be. Severe weather battered the entire country yesterday. The most rain fell in the Nelson Ranges, 200 millimetres fell in Coromandel, and 128 millimetres was recorded in Dunedin. In Christchurch, floodwaters began to recede this morning, revealing a car submerged in the Heathcote River. One person was safely rescued from the vehicle. Kasha Brownlee, News Hub. Heather's here now with NewsHub weather and the stats from all that rainfall are in. Yeah, and it's confirmed what everyone's been telling me for the last couple of days, that it has been wet. We're only 13 days into July. But already, Keri, Auckland, Fitianga, Tauranga and Rotorua have recorded a month's worth of rain. And there's more coming with another low approaching Northland, triggering another round of heavy rain watches. I'll have the details after sport. We'll see you then, thanks so much.

The horrors of the war in Ukraine may sometimes seem thankfully far away, but there are moments for even an international audience when it suddenly becomes personal again. And it happened today when a woman whose story became known around the world posted about her personal loss. ITV's Dan Rivers reports. Through the worst of the Russian siege of Harkiv, one young woman helped open our eyes to the unfolding carnage in a searing video diary. My city, Harkiv, is under constant attack, bombings, rocket fire, artillery fire, all day, nonstop. We're going to pick some water. An Asiya Parascavava's account moved viewers around the world after it was broadcast internationally. Her eyewitness testimony prompting hundreds to get in touch with offers of help. Last night was probably the most terrifying night of my life. This summer, we followed her and her mother on an emotional journey back to their home city where her father, Georgie, had remained through the worst of it. Two months apart, their reunion was a brief moment of hope in a country so in need of it. Yesterday, though, that optimism was shattered with this update. This morning, at 10, my father was killed by a rocket. So for those who saw that happy reunion, ITV news video, it's no longer relevant, unfortunately. Anasya had sent us a video of what's left of her family home. Her father had been standing on the balcony when the rockets hit. The local news showed the bloody aftermath. Anasya's mother left trying to find the words to sum up her grief and anger at this random, senseless violence, which nearly killed her too. A father who refused to leave his home, now remembered by the family who've been robbed of their only reason to stay. Sri Lanka's president has fled the country with his wife on a military plane to the Maldives.

A 34-year-old man's been charged with murder over the death of a woman in the Auckland suburb of Henderson. Police were called to an address on Newington Road just before 9 last night where they found a woman with gunshot injuries. She later died at the scene. A neighbour told News Hub they heard four gunshots as well as screaming before they called police. Police say they believe it's an isolated incident and the pair were known to each other. More images from NASA's groundbreaking James Webb Telescope have been released. They've allowed us to see deeper into space than ever before giving us insights into parts of the universe that are hundreds of millions of light years away. The James Webb is the successor to the Hubble Telescope, which is now more than 30 years old. You can see here the same image first taken by Hubble compared to how the new technology has captured it. And again here, the difference between the two generations of telescope is obvious. The James Webb is 100 times sharper than its predecessor. For more on just how remarkable it is, CBS's Mark Strassman reports. This is the vast Karena Nebula, 7600 light years from Earth within our own galaxy, birthing stars and planets. Here, stellar death, a gas cloud envelops a fading star. This image, Stefan's Quintet, shows five galaxies 290 million light years away. Baby pictures of the universe, majestic and humbling from a time machine now staggering NASA scientists. They're fantastic, absolutely beautiful, and they're a real hint at the power that the observatory will have. And liftoff. Launch last Christmas, the web space telescopes and engineering marvel, unfolding one million miles from Earth. 18 gold-plated segments form a giant mirror.

James Kingey is on a mission to raise awareness about what it's like to care for someone who has dementia through both the tough times, but also the really special times. It's a condition faced by more than 70,000 people here in Aoteiroa, including James' Koro Jim, who was diagnosed with dementia five years ago. DeAngelo Martin from The Hui has the story. Meet Jim Kingi and his mokopuna James. They used to buy me some cleats over there. Oh, okay. They've got a very special bond. They've got a very close over there. Oh, okay. Just here? Yeah, just there. They've got a very special bond. James is trying to jog his koro's memory, who five years ago was diagnosed with dementia. Out of the blue, sometimes he comes out with random things. Not the whole sentence is there. It'll just be like a random word or something like Rueh-Rura or Kangaro or Buddha James is Jim's main caregiver a few months ago he started a TikTok page to share their experiences Oh hey you unlocked it man you bloody clever That's how you've been getting you Just posting videos on social media showing the ups and downs of living with dementia to a following of more than 75,000 people. Some people have approached me and been like, oh, you know, thank you for what you're doing. I'm actually doing this at the moment and I've been a bit scared. Their daily TikTok posts has helped remove the stigma of dementia, a condition faced by 70,000 people in Aultearoa. Walk around with an adult, that should be looking after you, doing things that what a child or a baby does. You know, people feel a bit shame to deal with out in public. Being able to care for Jimmy at home can be tough on the Kingi Farno, but the mahi is worth it, says James. I appreciate him still being here. I love the fact that I can still touch him, I can still kiss him, I can still smell him, can still hug him and everything, you know. It's very much of their caro-a-to-your-go-Kingi.

A cruise ship with over 100 cases of COVID on board has been allowed to dock in Sydney with passengers free to disembark. They're supposed to take a rat test, but have told reporters it's an honesty system and nobody's being checked. 118 cases of COVID are aboard, but only four are passengers, the rest are crew. Sydney authorities say COVID's a fact and people must learn to live with it.

News have sport with Suzuki. Supporting our future stars with Bano Afina Plunkett. A senior all-black has delivered a warning to his teammates 14 months out from the Rugby World Cup. Start putting together consistent performances now if you want to be a force at next year's tournament. And while Rico Yawane wants consistency moving forward, he admits another C word, complacency played a major part in their downfall against the Irish in Dunedin. He sat down with our rugby reporter, Olly Ritchie in Wellington. Great to see you, man. How are you? You good? Rico Yuanese cutting a relaxed figure in Wellington ahead of Saturday's series decider, but admits the All Blacks failed to switch on at game time in Dunedin. Coming off the back of a loss last year into that first test, you know, we had that sort of knot in our gut which wasn't there. Did you get complacent after that result at Edom Park? I think there's naturally, yeah, there naturally was in game one and game two, the way we played. You know, it's a night and day. Defeat in Dunedin was more evidence of the All Black's prolonged inconsistency. Having lost three of their last four tests and with the World Cup creeping closer, Yuani knows they've got to get back on track quickly. The World Cup's not won on Saturday or even at the end of the year. But, you know, we've still got to be back on track quickly. The World Cup's not won on Saturday or even at the end of the year, but we've still got to be able to put the performances together in order to make that, you know, those steps. But as the pressure continues to mount on the all-blacks, former coach Sir Graham Henry feels the blowback has gone too far. No, I think we're going completely over the top here. I can't believe how bad it's been. And us New Zealanders don't believe anybody's any good apart from us. And so we just got to give them some credit. And we need to lift our own standards if we're going to compete. And Ioane is excited by the challenge of having to do that with the series on the line in Wellington. The big games are the ones that you remember and the ones that you want to be a part of. Saturday night shapes as the biggest of the Ian Foster era as the All Blacks look to get their year back on track. Olly Ritchie Newsub. Meanwhile, Angus Tarval's been suspended for three weeks following his red card during Saturday's loss in Dunedin. Taavall was sent off for what appeared to be an accidental head clash with Ireland's Gary Ringrose. The three-week ban could be reduced to two if he completes World Rugby's head contact coaching intervention program. Ta'avar would have missed this weekend's test anyway under the new automatic 12-day stand-down for a failed head injury assessment. Moldy All-Black's coach Clayton McMillans called for more games against leading international teams in the wake of his side's drawn series with Ireland. Despite the tourists squaring the series with a 30 to 24 win last night, McMillan believes their performances warrant more opportunities against the best. I saw this as a great opportunity to showcase Māori rugby and two wins would have probably applied a little bit of pressure on people that make decisions to keep finding us more games like this and hopefully it's seen enough. The Maldi All Blacks have played just six matches against Tier 1 nations in the last 12 years. The Silver Ferns will add the finishing touches to their preparations for the Commonwealth Games over the coming days with four matches in the Cadbury series. Alex Chapman's at Pullman Arena for game one against New Zealand A tonight. Alex, what are the team hoping to get out of the series? It's all about building combinations over the next few days, Andrew. They have around three players in each position, and who plays at the Commonwealth Games, will be dependent not only on the opposition, but the game style that Dame Noel and Toirua wants to play against Australia, England and Jamaica. Before they look too far ahead, though, they have to deal with a New Zealand side which has plenty of players with plenty of points to prove after they miss selection for Birmingham. A short time ago I caught up with Silverfern's captain Gina Crampton and asked her just what she's expecting from what will be a very determined New Zealand A side. We've come up against him a couple times in our last camp and it was a very physical battle. Obviously a lot of the players in that team could have been where we are right now so it's going to be tough, they're going to bring it to us for sure but that's exactly the prep that we need and that we want. I imagine it's been a weird few days without they know a lean total. How's been the US captain and what's been the difference with Deb Fulner in charge? Yeah, it's definitely been strange, and I guess it's hard when you lose your top leader of the team, and Knowles is such a big part of our group. But it's been nice. We've adapted quite well. Obviously, Debs has stepped in, and we're used to her as well. She's done a great job, and I think it's sort of been, you know, as much as possible. It's been business as usual. So for now, they have to not worry about that, Andrew. I'm told that they're still unsure whether Dame Noel Toto will rejoin the side tomorrow after battling COVID over the last few days. For now, though, the silver ferns have to worry about, as I say, a very determined New Zealand-Aiside. Alex Chapman live from Pullman Arena. Thanks very much. The biggest name in golf, Tiger Woods, has blasted his fellow pros who have joined the controversial Saudi-backed live tour, saying they've turned their back on the sport. It's the first time the 46-year-old has spoken on the matter since he turned down nearly a billion dollars to join the competition that's divided the game. And as Gordon Finlater reports, he also had some choice words for the man behind the breakaway tour. Tiger Woods started the Open Championship's 150th celebrations with legends of the game. But today, he's teed off on another. Greg tried to do this back in the early 90s. It didn't work then, and he's trying to make it work now. And I still don't see how that's in the best interest of the game Two-time Open champion Greg Norman Who is now the CEO of the controversial Saudi-backed live golf tour Wasn't invited to the home of golf I believe was the right thing Tiger wasn't done there though As he pulled out driver and let Rift at players who have joined the Ripple tour. What they've done is they've turned their back on what has allowed them to get to this position. Tiger turned down almost a billion dollars to join Liv and says those that signed up took the soft option. That is fantastic. What is the incentive to practice? What is incentives to go out there earn in the dirt? You're just getting paid a lot of money up front. And while there's no issue with Tiger's bank balance, the same can't be said of his body, still rehabbing from a 2021 car crash that almost ended his career. I'm able to walk a lot more holes, but also then then again I've got a lot stronger since then. Having won two of his three open championships at St Andrews, Tiger's competitors aren't ruling them out. It's going to be a game of chess this week and no one's been better at playing that sort of chess game on a golf course than Tiger over the last 20 years. A tiger roar on Sunday would certainly be a fitting celebration for 150 years of the Open. Gordon Windleater, Newsom. A 1-0 defeat to Germany has seen the Black Sticks Women's side knocked out of the Hockey World Cup at the quarterfinals. The Germans scored the only goal of the match early in the second quarter and while the goalposts and some fine work from Brooke Roberts kept the Kiwis in the match, the Black Sticks couldn't find an equaliser. It is a good feeling to be able to have our team play right till the end but that moment in the second quarter cost us. Yeah, it's a hard pill to swallow. The Blackstacks now turn their attention to the Commonwealth Games where they'll try and match the gold medal they won four years ago. Well, they made hard work of it, but the black caps have wrapped up their ODI series against Ireland with a match to spare, thanks to a three-wicket win in game two. Chasing 217, the black caps made a shocking start. Martin Guptal and Will Young fell to the first two balls of the innings. But half-centuries from Finn Allen and Tom Latham to the first two balls of the innings. But half-centries from Finn Allen and Tom Latham got the Black Caps' reply back on track. Well, was it? Smack one now to Cal Corner. All right, Skip, I'll do exactly that. Regular wickets kept Ireland in the hunts, but an unbeaten 42 from Michael Bracewell got the black caps home with almost 12 overs to spare. Kiwi cyclist George Bennett has been forced to withdraw from the Tour de France after testing positive for COVID-19. There was a different kind of disruption to stage 10 of the tour, with climate change protesters holding up the race for more than 10 minutes. The stage only resumed once they'd been dragged off the road. Magnus Court Nielsen went on to win the stage in a photo finish. Bennett's teammate Tade Pogaccha still holds the yellow jersey. Feels like there's a touch of irony about having a climate change process during a cycling races. I thought they'd be into spikes. They'd pick the wrong target there, I think. Anyway, good on them. Yeah, a little bit of a fail. Thanks so much, Gordy. Thanks, Andrew. Britain's Immigration Department has announced it will not be deporting Sir Mo Farrow. That's even though he's admitted in a BBC documentary to entering the country illegally and using a false name. Agencies that help child victims of people smuggling are unhappy at what they see as a double standard. ITV's John Ray has the story. He's a British sporting icon. Beautiful! But it turns out Mo Farrah has been living a lie. Most people know me as Mo Farrah, but it's not my name or it's not the reality. It is a stunning confession and who reveals a heartbreaking truth behind his glittering career. I was born as Hussein Abdi Kahan. His father killed in Somalia's civil war. He was smuggled to the UK on a stolen identity. As a family, we were torn apart. He became a child slave to a family of strangers in what to his young eyes was a strange land. Often I would just lock myself in the bathroom and crying. After a while I just learned not to have that emotion. He didn't start school until he was 12, where he found his true self on the athletics track. At the training ground that bears his assumed name, profound surprise among those who knew him. Shocked and, I guess, sad to hear Mo's early experiences. Very proud, you know, very proud of him as a person. Of course, his achievements on the track, but how brave he's been to share his personal story. Yeah, this is the visa. Although his British citizenship is based on a falsehood, the Home Office says no action will be taken. I know I've taken someone else's place, but... All that separates Mo Farah from the estimated 5,500 children trafficked into the UK is fame. There are many other children who are hidden, who are trafficked, who are victims. And the way the system operates is that it doesn't treat them with justice and fairness and equity. Special day! Mo Farah has won widespread sympathy. Whatever his real name, he remains a genuine national treasure. Northern Ireland has laid claim to a new world record and it's an unusual one. The world's tallest bonfire. The structure reached 61.5 metres in height well over the 60 metre mark previously set by Austria. The Irish then celebrated by setting the thing alight, a gesture that also marks a Protestant victory over the Catholics at the Battle of the Boyne. The Land of the Hot Dog has just come up with what must be the coolest capitalist popsicle on the planet. It's quite literally a taste of the rich and famous from Elon Musk to Jack Ma. The big tech treats are the concept of an artist's collective, aptly known as mischief, because some of their sales slogans are a bit risque. But for $10 a pop or popsicle, you can say which billionaire really sucks the most. Not sure if they'd be that into eating Elon Musk ice cream just quietly. Our top stories tonight, police were given a stack of new tools to tackle gangs today including a new offence of firing a gun to intimidate with a jail term of up to five years. And the Reserve Bank has raised the official cash rate to 2.5%. It's likely to hit mortgage holders with higher interest rates. And Statsen Z data out today shows grocery prices are also up 6.6% on the same time last year. Coming up next, we have news up weather, and another round of rain is on the way, Heather. Yeah, just as one low leaves, another one approaches. And this system will reach Northland tomorrow and then move southeast across the Upper North Island into Friday. There's still a lot of uncertainty as to the speed and track of the system, but heavy rain is expected. Your four forecast is next.

Turn it to power by Meridian. Kiyo-da, welcome back. It's been a full-on couple of days weather-wise. But good news, the low-pressure system responsible will continue its departure tomorrow off to the southeast. Bad news, another low is developing over the northern Tasman Sea, and it moves on to the north from tomorrow morning. So starting with Tewaipanamu, the South Island, rain will keep falling over the bottom section with snow to 500 metres tonight. Strong to Gail Sutherleys for the Deep South too. Tomorrow looks fine for the north but showers over Bulla, southland and Cluther and snow to 600 metres in the morning, light winds for the west. Occasional showers for most of Te Ica Amawi, the North Island, overnight with no westerly winds easing. Tomorrow the first front associated with the new low hits the north with heavy falls. Shows for Auckland and the Waikato turn to rain from the afternoon with fresh south. So the rain returns to Northland in the morning with heavy falls. Shows then turn to rain in the afternoon from Auckland, south and strong southeasterlies develop with the rain. Cloudy periods with morning showers for all here with northwesterlies dying out before lunch. The rain does arrive tomorrow night with sallysterlies developing as the rain ramps up. It's mainly fine for the east coast. Shows in the morning for Danny Burke. Then rain develops tomorrow night for Gisbon and Hawks Bay with Sal Easterlies kicking in late in the evening. Cloudy with morning showers for the majority here, Wellington will be fine all day but rain develops for Tomer Noe in the evening. Winds tend south east for most by the end of the day. Over the straight and mainly fine for Nelson but the west coast will be cloudy with showers. Westerlies die down in the afternoon with Sal East is developing in the evening. Over the divide and apart from some cloud, your day will be fine in the east. Shows do arrive for Kaikolda but not till late in the day with Sal westerlies from Christchurch south. The morning will be cloudy and showy for the rest of the island. The afternoon won't improve too much more for the deep south either. Sutherlies die down though tomorrow night. Right to the cities, Othipoti-Danidon will still be a tad wet tomorrow with scattered showers and snow above 600 metres at first. The south westerly is strong about the coast and it is cold. It is a dry day for you in Otautahi Christchurch with a few cloudy patches around for the day. Wind-wise, expect to sell westerly. The sun's out in Wellington and it will stay out till the evening when the clouds come over once again. It's windy though, with a strong north-westerly easing, then turning into a southerly. Looking fine with high cloud for Te-Matoa-Maua-Hawks Bay, there's a norwesterly wind that does die down in the morning and then develops into a south-easterly with rain late in the evening. More rain for Tauronga tomorrow, but not till much later in the day. After sunset, the saui-estrily picks up and heavy rain arrives for night. Shows for the Waikato and then that turns into rain from late in the afternoon. Winds aren't too bad during the day but a south easterly definitely picks up in the evening. And isolated showers before dawn for Tamukato, Auckland, but then it's cloudy, and then in the afternoon, rain arrives, heavy falls too, and saul easterlies. To Oz, and it's looking mainly dry, but a front does approach Perth from the Indian Ocean that will deliver showers. And the showers continue for New Caledonia, Fiji and Samoa, and spread to Vanuatu as well. Back home, it's wet and windy for the north again on Friday with just showers on Saturday. And finally, a dry and calm day on Sunday. Heavy rain at times for some on Friday, with showers clinging on Saturday, then it's fine for Tohunga for the end of the weekend. Similar weather for the weekend for the rest of the North Island, with strong or gale southerlies on Friday. It is looking calmer on Sunday, though. Nelson continues its dry run, but a few showers elsewhere for the end of the week, then the east dries out with the negative temperatures returning on Sunday. And snow lowers to 500 metres in the deep south on Friday, with showers clearing on Saturday. Overnight lows drop again for the weekend. So snow snow today for Twysalt but still plenty from yesterday to enjoy well fishing at the Twisal canals. I do have it on good authority. That's Steve the fisherman caught nothing. Oh, that's a bit rough. Well, there's always tomorrow. Thanks so much. Have another go. Cheers, Heather. And that is News Hub live at 6 for today.
