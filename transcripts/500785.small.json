Russia launches fresh attacks in Ukraine and fears it's targeting another country in Eastern Europe. We're live from Gallipoli ahead of the first Anzac Day commemorations there since the pandemic and has a self-proclaimed Gypsy King fought his last fight. Tyson furry drops a big King fought his last fight. Tyson weekend on the road. There's been 10 deaths so far including the four teenage boys in in Vekagal who police named today and there's been another concerning crash involving a carful of young people including an unrestrained four-year-old. Juliet Speedy reports. A bleak day in bluff reminiscent of the mood for many who live here today. Three of the four teenagers killed on Friday were from well-known families in the small community. Police today named the four teenagers a 17 year old Umara Huatau, Utifare Tafai Southland's Demon Softball Club paid tribute to Kaya posting. We are saddened at the tragic loss of Kaya Kennedy, a talented teammate and a fierce competitor on the diamond. He was a natural athlete and a pleasure to be around. It has been a shocking ANDAQ weekend on the roads. The horror smash here in Invercagal has contributed to the high road toll which is already more than double. That of Easter. Ten people have died in six separate crashes in just 48 hours. Foreign in Vekagal, one in Herakino, Raglan, Thangare, Thakitane, Livin and Ratahy. It is tragic. Unfortunately, you know, like we had four in Easter and we thought, oh, maybe there might be some changes, but no, sadly sadly there's not. In Vekagal's top cop, says scenes like Friday's horrific crash are now far too common. The emergency services right across the country, they deal with this unfortunately day and day out, and I think that's the message we've been trying to enforce for a number of years now is drive to the conditions, drive safely and slow down. Road safety advocates say it's the drivers that can change things. Be a safe driver and let's build a road safety culture in New Zealand where it becomes a norm to be good drivers in this country. Police say traffic will ramp up again during tomorrow's public holiday and they will have a visible presence on the roads. There's simple message to drivers, slow down and arrive. Okay Juliet on top of the awful road toll this weekend police have been dealing with another concerning incident involving young people in a car. That's right Mitch. This was a hit and run last evening in Topal. Police say they tried to stop a vehicle driven by a 17 year old who had two 16 year olds in the car and an unrestrained four year old. Now the car failed to stop for police, kept going and crashed into another car driven by an elderly person who received moderate injuries. The car then fled that scene too. Now police are calling this alarming, not only the dangerous manner of driving, but also the fact that such a young child was unrestrained in a car and also involved in a crash. It could have had deadly consequences. Police luckily did find the car and its occupants. They got the child safely back to family and the driver has now been charged with several offenses and will appear in the Rotorua Youth Court next week. Right Juliet, thank you for the update. The man who died after a stabbing in Invekagal has been named as Chad Parakura. A give a little page set up to support the 25-year-old's farm, says he was a young father who grew up in Lower Hudd and had turned his life around after moving to Invekagal to work in farming. A 22-year-old man who was also injured is in a stable condition in Southland Hospital. Police are asking anyone on Don Street at the time of the stabbing in the early hours of Saturday morning to get in touch. Russia's brutal war machine is broadening its attacks again today striking the southern port city of Odessa with cruise missiles. One hit an apartment block and according to local journalists a mother and her three-month-old baby are among the dead. Another effort to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Marjopold has again ended in failure. A Russian commander has revealed Moscow's planning to establish a land bridge across southern Ukraine to Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway Republican eastern Moldova. A Ukraine's president, Vlodomiz-Ljolenski, has again warned Europe that Russia wants to capture other countries. a day after day for eight weeks now. If this place is starting to resemble a lepo, it's because these are tactics Putin's troops learned in Syria. Besiege and destroy. Ukraine's Azov Battalion just released this video, we believe, filmed two days ago, showing the civilians in the bunkers of the Azov-style factory. Children play on their phones. We can go on, they say, but we want to go home, we want to see the sun again. These women are asked how long they've been down here. Since the 5th of March is the reply. Just outside Maripole, new satellite images appear to show a second mass grave being made during Russia's occupation. The Kremlin has denied trying to cover up the slaughter of civilians. But the casualties are increasing as phase two of this Russian invasion intensifies. Odessa was hit by seven missiles today and addressing the world's media. Ukraine's president could not hide his fury at this escalation. Eight people have now died in this attack. 18 to 20 people are wounded. A three-month-old baby has died. They killed a three-month-old baby. This war started when this baby was one month old. Can you imagine? Can you imagine what is happening? They are just scum. Just scum. I don't have any other words to use in this context. President Zilensky also had a call with the UK Prime Minister today. Boris Johnson confirmed more military aid will be sent to push back on Putin's latest advance. Tomorrow it is Easter for Orthodox Christians. Putin says there will be no ceasefire. A holy day, scarred like so much in this war. The New Zealand Defence Force has returned to Gallipoli and is preparing itself for a particularly special Anzac Day. It's their first event there since 2019. This year New Zealand is a ceremonial lead. Europe correspondent Lisa Raima reports. The once-war-troden hills of Gallipoli are back being traversed by New Zealanders. retracing the steps of a brutal battle that is etched in hearts and history. Standing with a Maori contingent slept in 1915, the New Zealand defence force today brought the Anzac spirit to guillipoli once more. COVID has stolen the Anzac Day show here for two years running. Now finally commemorations are returning to the peninsula. I do want to acknowledge the Turkish officials who have looked after our sons in their lands and have allowed us to come back and commemorate the ultimate sacrifice here. For Veterans Minister Meccafaitari, it's a first-time experience and a powerful one. She's not alone. This is the first time for myself. This is my first time. This is my first time. This is my first time. But the battle with COVID is not completely over and the small kiwi contingent has not taken any chances. As a bugler, I have another bugler who is currently down the hill about a view and there was, we had another one standby back home just in case because you can't have a ceremony without a last post. The traditional sounds and scenes and ceremony have been practiced and perfected and practiced again. With the care and attention deserving of the thousands of New Zealanders who were killed here. These were young men who lost their lives before they could live them and so it's up to us to come and honour them. New Zealand troops fought here for eight months. By the time the campaign ended more than 130,000 men had died. Of course you can see the apparent parallels between the terrible fighting that took place here and the terrible fighting that's going on today. It is not lost on anyone here this weekend that while Anzac Day honours the sacrifice of soldiers 107 years ago, right now that same tragic loss of life continues just north of here in Ukraine. That's why it's so important that we maintain a New Zealand defence force that is prepared and ready and is able to be contributing as in where our government determines it appropriate. The world's promise to remember them is more relevant than ever. All through the political and the governmental space, it's crucial that they remember the cost of war, so that they don't make it lightly. The names of our young Anzaks are grave and timely reminder of that cost. Well, Leslie joins us now live from Anzac Cove in Gallipoli. Anlea said it's not going to be a big day just for Anzac descendants. No, today is an incredibly important day for Turkey as well, Mitch. They will be holding their own national service here this morning. Both the Minister and our entire New Zealand Defense Force contingent will attend that tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers throughout the old Ottoman Empire died during this campaign and New Zealand has again expressed its deep gratitude to Turkey for allowing us to return time and time again to this peninsula. It will be a day filled with emotion but it has been a very difficult two years for people in this area. There have been no tourists, there has been very little business and locals have expressed to us just how thrilled they are to have people back here and relaunch themselves into this post-pandemic world with such a significant and meaningful event. Lissette Rama live from Anzac Cove in Gallipoli, Lissette thank you. creating one of New Zealand's most famous victories of the First World War. It's designing a living memorial in La Quinoa, where Kiwi troops liberated the northern French town from the Germans in late 1918. Kaylee Callaghan reports. This grand old mansion in the French town of La Quixois will soon become the new home of one of our most famous war stories. The Kiwi troops scaled the war using a ladder to get into the town and to chase the germs out and to capture them. But just what that recreation will look like remains a secret for now. Wetter Workshop is developing plans to bring to life the tale of the Kiwi triumph over German forces in the last days of the First World War. We have to be very careful about the sensitivities of the story and the people involved. One of those involved Leslie Avral, who was the first soldier to climb up this very wall, sparking the liberation. An occasion still celebrated today, locals marking Anzac Day commemorations early. The fact that this town was liberated by troops that had come from the other side of the world and that has a special place in the hearts of the inhabitants of La Canua. This is a fantastic opportunity for people to come in and see some of the history, the New Zealand history in France. Weta workshop has dived into our war history before creating Gallipoli, the scale of our war. More than 3 million people have been through the exhibition at Tipapa in Wellington. We really hope that the Living Memorial will achieve the connection and relationships between people that go there. No civilians died during the liberation, 135 of our soldiers did. The town has never forgotten. The sacrifice of our soldiers and the ties that have endured now as Madame La May said over 100 years. It's hoped by Anzac Day next year. This Kui story will have a new chapter to be told. Kaley Callahan News Hub. There was another dip in COVID-19 cases today with just over 5,600 new infections reported. Nine more people with the virus have died, the youngest aged in their 50s. For some it was only discovered they had COVID after their deaths. 490 people are battling the virus in hospital. 20 are in ICU or a high dependency unit. Some of the last remaining COVID-19 restrictions in several Australian states have now been scrapped. In Victoria and New South Wales, close contacts of positive cases no longer need to isolate for seven days. In bar and kitchen staff and many Melbourne venues have shed their face masks. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says he intends to have all restrictions gone by July. In France, voting has just got underway in the presidential election. It's a tight race between centrist incumbents Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Maureen Le Pen. Evesant reporter Rosie Bertrand joins us now live from Paris. Rosie is there a clear front runner yet? Emmanuel Macron is looking to secure around 55 to 57% of the vote so he is hoping for a win but of course that is a much tighter margin between him and his far-right challenger Maureen Le Pen than last time round in 2017 when Macron secured a landslide victory so the big question really here is where are the votes of the leftist candidate Jean-Lécémentain Saint who was knocked out in the first round but got around one in five of the votes? Where are they going to go? Both Macon and Le Pen have been courting the left in their last two weeks of campaigning, hoping to secure some of those votes. But around two-thirds of those Méron-suin supporters said they might either spoil their ballot or simply not vote-on-h don't want either Macron or lippens so a tighter race than perhaps the incumbent Emmanuel Macron would like. Those French voters are lining up now in that polling station behind me to decide who they will give the keys of the Elizay Palace to and both candidates, Le Pen and Macron finished their campaigning on Friday by calling all French people and all French citizens with right to vote to come and exercise that right to vote. Turnout is something that's very much on both of their mind and it's something we don't yet know how it's going to turn out throughout the day. Rosie Burchard, live from Paris, Rosie, thank you.

A section of State Highway 36 between Torong and Rotorua was closed this afternoon after a bus crashed off the side of the road in Nahuaro. The vehicle, which appeared to be a converted house bus, could be seen in pieces at the bottom of a cliff in the Mangorua Gorge. Two people were inside the bus at the time of the accident. One was seriously injured. The other suffered moderate injuries. A Hawks Baye we hope an almond growing study in the region will result in unproductive Maori land finally turning a profit. Scientists are looking at whether the region has what it takes to commercially grow the nutty fruit. Alexa Cook has the story. These are Tony Kuclinsky's almond trees. He's been growing them in central Hawks Bay for 12 years and now has several hundred. The flowering is going to be fantastic. All that. What's also fantastic is he doesn't use pesticides, herbicides or irrigation. I've built up my organic matter of content. Therefore I'm storing more water and I've planted the trees straight into that. The former dairy farmer is part of the plant and food research study to see if almonds can grow sustainably in Hawkes Bay. New Zealand imports more than 42 million dollars of almonds a year, mostly from California, where farmers use up to 12 litres of water to grow a single nut. Something scientists here want to avoid. With our knowledge around how trees perform and how we can manipulate the architecture of the tree, we think we can reduce water consumption quite significantly. The project is also investigating the economic feasibility and consumer demands for locally grown almonds. We see smaller areas of production which are a lot more friendly to the local environment. The almond study is being funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, four different councils, Tony Keklinsky and the Picks Peanut Butter Company, all hoping that this little nut will be a big winner for the Hawkes Bay economy. They could go into cereals that you could sell them just as a fresh nut. You could create almond butter, these almond oil, there's just numerous options at this stage. Options the local Ewe wants to explore. Langatani has about a hundred hectares of unproductive and unprofitable land near Waipawa. The condition of the land, Kaatangai. profitable land near Waipawa. The condition of the land, Kaatangayaho, okay? I'm sad. And when somebody puts up an idea like Amans, I go, why wouldn't we look at it? If it is feasible and can be done? She's urging her Ewe to get on board. Surely there's something more for us here. Hoping this Maori own land can soon provide for its people and prosper into something like this. a lexicook news hub. Tonight we bring you the stories of two families affected by cystic fibrosis. One is having a very different experience to the other because they can't get access to the so-called miracle drug Tricaffda. It's still not available to many sufferers because Farmac is still discussing it with manufacturer vertex. Alice Wilkins has this because it matters story. Just watching them with their two-year-old geez you can feel how thankful James and Emily are to have each other. Because four years ago their family was minutes away from being torn apart by cystic fibrosis. About three or four years ago I actually lost my fight with CF and I was very lucky that Emma was there to fight for me. She did CPR on me for ten minutes to keep me alive. CF fills the lungs with thick mucus. Jameses were so badly damaged that the 28-year-old suffered a major bleed in his right lung. Yeah, I'd had first day training, so I had half an idea of what to do. I remember him like fitting on me, and I felt then, but he's still fighting. Emma managed to bring back James' heartbeat, buying them enough time for a chopper to land at their Pydore farm and get him to hospital. two months later, they got married. Even the photographer was crying. When they went to have jes through IVF, there was another shock. Unfortunately for us, Emma also carried the same CF gene that I have two of. She is also a carrier, so that made IVF just a little bit more tricky. Our embryos had to go off for PDD testing which can identify the CF sufferers and pull them out. Just drafting off the cows. James whose half Kiwi keeps himself active as a farmer but has to self-fund a after the expense of medication from overseas to help slow his lung decline. My lovely concoction of pills. He's never had tricaster but moving back to the UK where it's available is now a very real option to get as much time with his daughter as possible. We want to see our kids grow up. But we also want to see other kids grow up. We're here. Two of those other kids are 16-year-old twins Lily and Moniah Graham who we met last year. That's when they first shared they had cystic fibrosis. Their friends and teachers didn't even know. We want to be normal. Since then they've been given access to tri-calfter which would normally cost more than $300,000 a year per person, a cost they couldn't afford. Their specialist put them up for Vertex's managed access program. We got a message from the pharmacy to say that our prescription was being put through and they'd let us know when it was ready. And so, me and Lily went and picked up the girls and we drove up there and sat outside on the hospital until it was ready. And I remember I think we cried because we were so happy. The twins say they noticed the difference overnight and after two months Lily's lung function has risen to 47% minires to 60. They're playing sport, taking part in kappa haka and have even starred in a music video. I have a job now. Amazing. I'm more active. I mean I'm hungry all the time now. And I can speak better. I'm more active. Like I can keep up with my kappa haka group. Oh we can breathe now as well. Like watch this, watch this. I didn't cough now. Like something they now want people like James and his family to have the chance to experience. Alice Wilkins, News Hub.

Good evening and welcome to Super Sports Sunday. We begin tonight with rugby and it took three games of the Super Round but the Australians have their first win over Kiwi opposition in Super Rugby Pacific. The Brumbies have beaten the Highlanders 28 to 17 in Melbourne holding off aspirited second half fight back from the Southerners to hold second spot on the Super Rugby ladder. Our rugby reporter Ollie Ritchie has the action from Amy Park. The top of Australia against one of the bottom in New Zealand. The Rumbies hope to be the first Ozzy side to taste victory in the trans-Tazzen component of Super Rugby. They almost had the perfect start. Oh much as he dropped it. He can't have. He can't have. The Brumby's bullish, that wouldn't be a sign of things to come. Their attack looked slick in the early stages but fell apart through basic errors. But as the Brumby's continued to dominate position, they wouldn't be denied again. The try is on the board. The Highlanders were camped in their own 22 for large parts of the first half and would once again full victim to the Brumby's dominance as they went over for their second of the afternoon. Lodding and still with it and sneaking his way through. And after finally spending some time in the Brumbies 22, the Highlanders had their first of the match. bank.......and they're just too strong....and they're back in the fight. The Southerners had to be the first to score after the break, and through Captain James Lynchex, they delivered. Coming away with it, and putting his captain over. The boot of Noah Lola Cio ensured the Brumbies maintained their buffer, and he was on hand to finish a nice piece of attack to extend the lead even further. That was enough to seal victory, the first of the weekend for the Australians, as the Brumbies prove, they are more than up for the Kiwi challenge. Yes, and the Crusaders will close out the inaugural super round this evening against the Rebels kicking off a four-week tour in Australia for the Red and Black's. Let's go to our rugby reporter Ollie Ritchie who's at Amy Park. Ollie, this is a pretty well-time trip away for the Crusaders. Yeah, it comes at a really good time for them Andrew. They like touring, they like touring, they like the Comrader and the togetherness, that comes with being blues at home. Unfamiliar territory for the Crusaders losing a game at home. They're not used to that at all but coach Scott Robertson tells me that how they respond to that will be a good test heading into the back end of the season. You get a little bit deeper off of loss and we'll learn from that. It's a reminder of mind in it like winning is hard you know they're winning consistently over and over. You've got to be pretty complete side and you've got to be up every week and every week's a final for us. As I mentioned it's a great opportunity for us to learn and dig deep now. Help us back end. Help us for a back end. There's also been some time for a bit of networking for Scott Robertson over here. He's been at at Melbourne Stormhorm HQ at their training today catching up with Coach Craig Balame. The pair have a very close relationship they often catch up when either side, when either team is on either side of the Tasman, a great opportunity to pick their brains. Craig Balame told me he wanted to get inside Scott Robertson, he wanted to get inside Scott Robertson's head, find out what makes him tick, find out why he's managed to make the Crusaders so successful over a number of years.. so successful over a number of years. He will be hoping for more of that success on Amy Park when the Crusaders take on the Rebels very soon. I'll let you go and enjoy that. Ollie Ritchie live there from Amy Park. Thank you. All means on the Reds admit they blew a golden chance to be the first Australian side to not to victory over the Kiwis last night after throwing away a 17-point lead against the hurricanes. the Reds held a 17-nille-nill lead after 35-after after 35-after to a 35- after 35 minutes thanks to a dominant first half by the Queenslanders. But in the space of just five minutes that lead was cut to just three at the break. And from there they didn't score another point as the hurricanes cruised in the second half to when 30-17. The errors that we make against the Osse we get away with it. So when you come up against guys like T.J. Artie, Geordi Garrett, you're going to get punished if you give him that much quality ball like we did tonight. And the blues were no happier with their performance despite never really being troubled by the Fijian drawer, winning 35 to 18. It was an error-ridden performance from the top of the table blues who just couldn't seem to get their game going. Perhaps we underestimated how much they can probably fluster you because of the lack of momentum that we got and we weren't allowed to play our game at times. The blues expect to welcome back Akita Yewane from injury for their clash with the force next week while Caleb Clark is also available after serving his three weeks suspension. Tyson Fury has saved his best for last as the Gypsy King delivered a devastating knockout against fellow Brit Dillian White in their WBC heavyweight showdown at a sold-out Wembley Stadium. Fury controlled the fight until the sixth round when a brutal uppercat dropped white to the canvas putting an exclamation mark on a stellar career. But whether it really is his last fight remains to be seen. Nikki Starris reports. It was billed as the all-Brit Bonanza for one champion his last fight for the other, his biggest. But there was no question who emerged King of the tempo. His height and reach advantage making it impossible for the body snatch it to snatch anything at all with the fight at times turning ugly. The man whose life read like a Hollywood script was writing the fairy tale finish to his colorful and successful career. Stund and then debt. But the undefeated champion was gracious in victory, well almost. Dylan White is a warrior and I believe Dylan will be a world champion. But tonight he met a great in the sport and one of the greatest heavy weeks of all times. And insists he won't be coaxed out of retirement, not for money, belts or legacies. It's not been about anything apart from punching a motherfafckes face right in on the night. And with that, the 33-year-old went left field and called out UFC star Francis and Gano. He's on my hit list in an exhibition fight over he wants in a cage. In a cage or on a stage. All together now! So, bye, bye, bye, America, The curtain may have come down on Fury's remarkable boxing career, but for this showman, don't count out another on-core. Mickey Stairis Newshub.

The best of three contests is now level at one all after Dame Lisa Carrington fought back to beat army Fisher and this morning's second race on Lake Carapero. Despite only returning to the high-performance environment last year, Fisher is ready to prove herself in Thursday's ultimate showdown. Natasha Payne caught up with her. A race so close. No one could make out who had won. But despite leading majority of the way, Amy Fisher was pit on the line by rival Lisa Carrington in their second race, making it one-all in the Best of Three contest. I think we said it yesterday, like it is the Clash of the Titans. Although a loss, today's results proves Fisher is side by side with New Zealand's golden and girl beating her by eight milliseconds yesterday and losing by just 11 today. Another good showdown today where it was you know meck and neck and she got the win and full respect you know. The 27 year old ruled herself out of contention for the Tokyo Olympics in 2019, following a standoff with canoe racing ends over athlete welfare and only returned last year. But she's now ready to step back on the world stage. It's always a privilege to be able to represent New Zealand and you know building into the Olympics it's good to kind of get that experience you know at the world champs. Coach Gavin Almagir says the 2016 Olympian has not only grown as an athlete but as a person in the two years he's knowing her. I'm very proud of Amy. the ups and the downs and to be here today and doing what she loves and in front of everyone and showing the world what she can do. I think we should be just inspired. After today's narrow result, the pressure is now building on both athletes who on Thursday will race on this lake for a third and final time to try and claim that golden spot. Natasha Payne, New Hub. The Wellington Phoenix have climbed a fourth on the A-League ladder with a one-nil win over the Western Sydney Wanderers, a result that may have been helped by Auckland's changeable weather. 15,000 fans soaked up the sun for the team's second and final home match of the regular season at Eden Park. Ben Wayne soon gave them something to celebrate opening the scoring after 22 minutes. The Wanderers looked set to equalize when they were awarded a penalty following a typical Auckland downpour. Tastriflee for Stephen Ugarkevic. His plant foot went from underneath him. It's been untidy, it was a much improved second half display by the visitors who were twice denied by the woodwork. But former Nixon now wanderers Coach Mark Rudin couldn't hide his frustrations and was sent off in the dying stages as the phoenix held on to take all three points. Well there was more reason to smile for Key West Coach Michael McGuire last night. His battling Tigers side backing up their first win break. And with a minute to play and the school's tied at 22 all, Luke Brooks stepped up for the hosts. He points to Brooks, it's Brooks, let the field go, it's Luke Brooks this time. Also last night, the Cowboys were far too good for their Queensland rivals in a 30 to 4 demolition of the Titans, while this afternoon the Eels ran riot against the nights winning 39-2. And don't forget we have live free-to-air coverage of the Warriors traditional Anzac Day clash against the Melbourne Storm at Amy Park. That's from 830 tomorrow night right here on 3. Well finally tonight it's been a super week of sports around the world. Everything from rugby's inaugural super round in Melbourne to some super fans in the crowd Lucy Thompson has this week super sporting moments. The week began with a hiss and a roar. Home again say yellow fever. The roar of 18,000 Phoenix supporters at Sky Stadium for their first home game in almost a year. Brooklyn Nets Point Guard Kairi Irving wasn't so kind to his fans, subtly flipping them the bird during the game. Speaking of birds, it's not every day a pigeon interrupts proceedings at the crucible. Oh goodness me, hang on, we've got an unexpected visitor in the house. Elsewhere Devin Booker was feeling the love from this super fan. While this dude showed off his super powers at the baseball. There's style right there, I like that's it. And it's been a super weekend of super rugby, especially if you're a kiwi. Right with the kay and last a four! And now streak away for their first try on the night. especially if you're a kiwi. And they'll just fall. And they'll streak away for their first try on the night. Lamb's side of his way through and over. Another man putting on a show, Tyson Fury. The Gypsy King proving not so gentle inside the ring at this morning's WBC heavyweight showdown. But all in all it's been another superb week of sport. So let's celebrate over a cold beer or maybe not. It's unfortunate we've all been on the receiving into one of those haven't we mentioned? We have Andrew it's a tough one to take. It is. Thank you Andrew. Well reintroducing car carpal to the North Island is a step closer. It's part of a 42 million dollar proposal to create an eco-sanctuary north of Wellington. Mitchell Alexander has the story. 3,000 hectares of green goodness. The perfect home for our most endangered birds. I think the carcopaw will really love this place. Conservationists agree. A feasibility study touts this native forest as the ideal habitat for species like Carkapoor, hehehe and Kiwi. That's big, it's dominated by remu, which is what Carkapore really need for breeding. And it's also really easily accessible. To bring the idea to life, the study estimates 42 million dollars over a decade would finance consent's infrastructure and the eradication of pests. It would probably be unlike any other single biodiversity project that you could imagine in New Zealand. The area is about twice the size of Carpetia Island. You could completely exclude predators from it. To keep pests out a 29 kilometre predator-proof fence standing two meters high will line at the sanctuary's perimeter here. A a 29 kilometer predator-proof fence standing two meters high will line the sanctuary's perimeter here. A new 16 kilometer road will also need to be built to facilitate the fence. If it gets the green light, the plan is to relocate at least 150 Kakapur here of the only 197 alive today. Dark, the regional council and Manafenenua will join forces to make it happen. We will care for those tailing the species as best we can alongside them of course and alongside experts in conservation. The face of this project now rests with the government which is considering funding the proposal. We don't have many alternatives if we want to bring those threatened species back from the brink. Here's one that would work. Let's give it a note. And assurances are being made. Wellington's weather won't put the potential new arrivals off. They're pretty used to some pretty wild weather. Some of the southern islands where they live is pretty rugged. The wild weather up here probably wouldn't worry them too much, I hope. Hope, which could mean more of this in the future.
