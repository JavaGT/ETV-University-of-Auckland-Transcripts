Fangare Hospital sends out a warning to holidaymakers as it struggles with high COVID numbers. And a Kiwi lawyer says there is now enough evidence to prosecute Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. new crime. Afternoon, the end less than 12 hours later, police were also dealing with a homicide after an attack left one man dead and another fighting for his life in hospital. He's duly speedy. The aftermath of the horror smash. A Blackford Ranger with four teenage boys collided with a concrete truck at around 4 p.m. yesterday with devastating consequences. Tragically, four young men passed away at the scene. Three of those men were age 16 and one from 17. Pretty wet and I guess the road is pretty slippery as well if you are not driving to the condition. Surely the boys lost control of the EU and then came sideways on the road and end up in and try on the truck. Today police were back on Queen's Drive trying to piece together what happened on a major central road and what was atrocious weather. There's a lot of speculation and we're not going to be speculating. We want to get all effects together to build up the bigger picture. all effects together to build up the bigger picture. Police guided family members behind the cordon to see the spot where their loved ones lives ended. It's just to help take that grieving process. Three of the boys were from the small tight-knit community of Bluff, half an hour down the road. They are from well-known Bluff families that have lived in Bluff, some of them for generations. and the ripple effect going around Bluff some of them for generations and the ripple effect going around Bluff is you know it's quite strong. Ray Fife is a distant relative of one of the boys and like most people in the town knows all the families. The families you know are involved in the mooray here which which is a big part of the community and they're another family through sporting and three teenagers that they've got their lives to look forward to for a small community. It is very big. Boys attended Southland Boys High School in Invekagal. Southland Boys High Rector Simon Co issued a statement saying they are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of these young men from the community here. Their focus now is on supporting the Fano and friends. Police are asking for help from the public for their investigation. We would ask anybody who may have seen the Ford Ranger or the concrete truck leading up to the crash, particularly people who have dash cam on the vehicles. We'd be very interested to see that footage. Less than 12 hours after the crash, just after midnight, two men were stabbed in the centre of town. One died and the other is fighting for his life in hospital. And the Cargill police now also investigating that and hunting down those responsible. Traject, really. However, we have some really good staff here who have all come out at short notice to support us. A terrible start to Anzac weekend for these small southern communities. Do you lead a truly horrible situation? Do we know anything more about how this crash actually happened? Well Mitch, what we do know is the weather was absolutely atrocious here at 4 p.m. yesterday to rent your rain and really low visibility and all the residents and witnesses around here that I've spoken to say that they believe that that Blackford Ranger was either trying to change lanes or possibly do a u-turn when the concrete truck smashed right into the side of it but police haven't confirmed this they are still investigating to figure out exactly what happened here. But what everybody does agree on is this was truly a horrific smash shocking everyone from the first responders on the scene. To the many members of the public who also tried to help straight after this happened. But of course it is no shocking of all for the family of the victims of this terrible tragedy here in Southland. Certainly as Juliet, thank you for the updates. The Ministry of Health is reporting the deaths of 19 people with COVID, but that includes people who have died over the past seven days. Two of the deaths were under nine years of age and one person was in the 20s. There was a slight decline in new infections today with just under 8,000 new cases reported. 494 people are in hospital, battling the virus, 15 of those are in ICU or a high dependency unit. And a person who travelled here from overseas has been confirmed as our first case with the XE variant of Omicron. They are isolating at home. There is no evidence today that XE causes more severe disease than other Omicron variants. Well can join us now. more severe disease than other on the converion. Well there's been a COVID warning from the Ministry of Health about people travelling this long weekend. News Hub reporter Alice Wilkins joins us now. Live in Alice, one district health board in particular is concerned about an influx of holidaymakers. comes to bed space with high levels of demand for DHB services in Northland as COVID continues to have an impact there. And with more people travelling to the region over the long weekend hospital leaders want people to take extra precautions. They say that those with the most urgent need will be the ones who are prioritised when it comes to hospital space. It comes as the Ministry of Health reminds travellers over the long weekend to stay at home if they feel unwell, to continue practicing good mask wearing wherever they travel to, and to be prepared to extend their stay, should they contract COVID-19 while they're away. That's unless, of course, they can transport themselves home safely in their own vehicle to complete their isolation there. Right, us, Wilkinson from Auckland, Alice, thank you.

Evidence of alleged war crimes is being collected by the international community as Russia takes over the southern city of Maripola in Ukraine.

And a warning, Kaley-Khalahan story contains some confronting and distressing images of war. As the city of Marjopol burns in the background, Russian-backed Chechen fighters celebrate victory. Vladimir Putin claims to be in control of the city, but just how Russia got there is under investigation. The UN has documented at least 50 civilian deaths. This is believed to be one of the first alleged war crimes of the conflict. Russian forces opened fire on a father, son and their pets in a civilian car, just one day into the invasion. The father Oleg was shot and later died. His son Vadim, survived the attack, which left their car riddled with bullets. What threat were we? With our bare hands? We didn't have any weapons or arms. We were driving a civilian car. It's incidents like this that could help build a criminal case against the Russian state. We have enough evidence already to go ahead with a prosecution of Putin for the crime of aggression, for the decision to wage war in the first place. Kiwi Rebecca Hamilton is a law professor in Washington DC. She told Newshub Nation specific evidence and witnesses are needed to take that case further. For a prosecutor you've actually got to link that to an individual perpetrator and then up the chain of command and that takes all sorts of evidence. The evidence of alleged war crimes is piling up as more mass graves are being discovered near Marupol. The city's mayor believes these photos show another site found in the last two days. More and more of them are appearing and we believe that in those Mars graves, they will be hiding their war crimes. In these graves, they are burying thousands of Marupal people. While the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction over Russia, evidence against it is still being gathered. What the history shows is that we get there in the long run. So it's important to be gathering the evidence and building these cases today. So that one day the perpetrators of alleged war crimes against thousands of civilians may be held accountable. Kaylee Callahan, News Hub. The US has warned the Solomon Islands it will take action if China is allowed to establish a military base on the island nation. The message was delivered directly to the country's leaders by a visiting US delegation. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Minasa Sogovare reiterated there would be no Chinese military base and no long-term presence. The Solomons occupies a strategic place in the Pacific, and there are concerns China, is trying to to establish a military presence in the Pacific Island nation. Nationals finance spokesperson Nicola Willis has defended her leader over his confused messages about Labour Day. Christopher Luxon suggested cancelling Labor Day but later reversed that call. Willis told New Zealanders he possibly confused people. As he said himself and you know I acknowledge his humility he didn't express himself as well as he could. Is that what New Zealanders are talking about this week Simon I don't think. Michael Willis also says Lux and possibly confused people when he suggested public transport should not be subsidised before again backtracking. A leading skin cancer specialist wants the government to fund full body melanoma skin checks for high-risk quies. A recent report found New Zealand has the highest rate of melanoma cases and deaths in the world. But our prevention and treatment is falling behind. Shannon Redstel reports. As quies ease their way into winter, the last of the summer sun is welcome. their way into winter, the last of the summer sun is welcome. But what's not welcome is the damage hiding in its golden glow. Martin Gunman knows all too well. He spent his youth outdoors. Typical North Shore boy outside at the beach is running around the young builder shorts shirt off. It may have been those long shirtless days that landed him with several melanoma. The latest ones were up here quite high up. The earlier ones in 86 were across the chest there too there and one on the back. Fortunately doctors caught the spots early enough to have them removed and it's preventative measures like this that Dr Chris Boburg would like to see more of. There are over 350 people die in New Zealand a year of melanoma. Now a lot of those could have been caught early and they would be alive today. A recent study found a tera-rau had the highest melanoma death rate in the world in 2020, with global cases set to double by 2040. And it's the prevalence of the cancer that has led Dr Boburg to ask for better from the government. I would love to see some government funding for this issue. It would make a huge difference. He wants fully funded annual skin checks for Kiwis at risk of melanoma. These checks currently cost several hundred dollars which is out of reach for many Kiwweaves. Royal New Zealand College of GPs Dr Brian Betty is on board with the idea. Anything that encourages a yearly check for New Zealanders with skin is a positive. But health minister Andrew Little says he takes his guidance from the cancer control agency and this isn't something they've mentioned. It's just not something I've received any advice on or be nudged to take any further action on at this point. Because of his history with melanoma, Martin would be the sort of person eligible for these annual checks. As would many people over 50 with fair skin and freckles or a family history of melanoma. But he's not waiting around for funding. I treat it as if I've got a cold or some ailment that go to a doctor about I don't wait around I get it checked out a number of times it means nothing but it's that one time you do find it. Shannon Redstool News Hub. Two armies of volunteers kitted with brushes and buckets is set off on a mission to clean the graves of our veterans today. The Student Volunteer Army partnered with the New Zealand Remembrance Army, a head of Anzac date. Mitchell Alexander, has the story. during three fallen brothers are appropriately commemorated. It's really important that we like go and restore the graves because it means that the soldiers who served could be remembered. This restoration of Memorial Headstones to honour Wellington raised Watkin, Samuel and Tom Lewis, who died during the first World War, but whose bodies never came home. It's believed Watkin was wounded within hours of arriving at Gallipoli in August 1915 and later died. His brother Tom passed away at sea after being wounded in the same battle. The youngest brother Samuel was killed in France in early 1918. The significance of this job, not lost. I think it's super important because you can actually see where there's been and what they did. It's important. Important to many with 500 volunteers across 30 locations around New Zealand doing their bit to clean the memorials of past service women and men. Real question is why wouldn't you do it? Serve for us. It's the least we owe to them. The work coordinated by the remembrance army who have been doing it for five years. I mean a lot of people go to parades and say less we forget, but as you can see from today, the state of the graves we do forget and these kids today clean them all up, which is fantastic. It's estimated there are over 350,000 service graves in New Zealand. Today we found one more trying to prepare another grave. This is the grave of Thomas Craig who was the bootmaker for the Wellington Regiment. Before that he worked at Hannah's shoes. He ended up being awarded the meritorious service medal for his bootmaking. The public has been urged to roll up their sleeves to help pay their respects. They could like come in and like maybe give them a spray of water or The public has been urged to roll up their sleeves to help pay their respects. They could like come in and like maybe give them a spray of water or check them out, see the history. And prevent the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice from being forgotten. Mitchell Alexander, New Top. Well time now for a look at two days' weather and how has long weekend been so far Mike? Well pretty good actually, much for most of the country actually, but a southwesterly flow has kept things a little cool. The Bay of Islands however took the days high of 21 degrees.

The opinion polls give the sitting president Emmanuel Macron, the edge, but Marine Lapine's far-right party, is closing in. Here's James Mates from ITV. The polls say she's heading for defeat, slipping daily further behind Emmanuel Macron but no one here believes it. In front of some of her most faithful supporters in the town of Arras, deep in her northern heartlands, Marine LaPain made one more plea, one more exhortation to change France fundamentally. People of France, she said, the time has come to rise up against the oligarchs who have no religion but globalisation and the invisible hand of faceless, soulless, borderless markets. I believe the Marxists. Even if the polls are right and she doesn't win on Sunday, no one here will consider this campaign a failure. The last time she ran, she had no chance. This time she has made not only President Macron but the whole of Europe sit up and take notice of just how close the French are to electing a far-right president. The crush to get into this event suggested that enthusiasm is not waning far from it and nor is optimism. No prizes for guessing what President Macron's message was today as he taught a Paris suburb. The enthusiasm is not waning, far from it, and nor is optimism. No prizes for guessing what President Macron's message was today as he taught a Paris suburb. Yes, he's in a fight here and he knows it. He came out aggressively in the TV debate last night and is campaigning now by taking his arguments to the streets. Never afraid to debate, he's avoided big set- piece rallies and it seems to be working. 15 points in front, heading for a victory that would see the chancellors of Europe breathing a huge sigh of relief. Tonight was La Penne's last big rally election hearing must stop tomorrow, but will it be the end for this perennial campaigner? If she's even close on Sunday, don't be surprised if she's back trying to go one step further in five years time. A travel booking website has been fined 45 million dollars in Australia for offering misleading hotel room rates. Customers believe they were getting the cheapest deal but that wasn't always the case. While no one to people on this side of the Tasman too, the Commerce Commission here has received complaints. He's Estelle Greaping from Channel 7. As a travel booking company, Trevago told its customers to look no further. To find your ideal hotel at the best price. Hotel, Trevago. But what travellers were shown was highly misleading and led to Australian holidaymakers being ripped off by more than $30 million. The Truvago algorithm preferenced the hotel booking sites that paid Truvago the highest commissions. Truvago was today fined 44.7 million dollars by the federal court for duping customers into believing they were getting the cheapest price. During the offending period customers followed links on Travago more than 100 million times. The vast majority clicking on the top position offer. But more than half of the highest ranked hotel deals weren't the best available. It's very easy to get tricked by these sites. This is just the tip of the iceberg. You know, it's not just travel. These sites compare insurance, they can pay electricity. Trevago says it's since changed its website and now wants to look forward, but first it'll have to pay that 44.7 million dollar fine as well as the legal costs of the ACCC. People don't realize the secret commissions that are being charged by these sites those commissions have to be borne by somebody and they are borne by the consumer. or Nikki's in later was sport and the super round continues Nikki.

So what do they do with it? Do they make as much money off it as they can, $40 billion by government estimates, by planting pine for carbon credits? Or do they take a hit and return it all to natures forest? Or is there a third option? Here's our Moly of heres correspondent, Terena Corfi. Pajunarongarotetangata, toy tu, de fenua. This mori proverb talks about the deep connection mori have with their land. But years with confiscation and land alienation have left mauli with some of the worst fenua in Altiarua. The scale only goes to eight, and eight is the worst classification and 80% of Mardi's 1.6 million hectares is in category six to eight. Half of moldy land is underutilized, most of it is marginal and steep meaning forests are the only option. If that land was planted right now it could be worth 40 billion dollars to moldy land owners through carbon credits. Trouble is the government is considering removing those credits on exotic forests. Kekpungah Jews represents moldy foresters and wants the government to leave the payment alone. So is it a racist proposed policy? A policy that would perpetuate the continued suppression of Mari being able to realize economic benefit from our marginal and underutilized land. And if that's racist or institutionally racist, then yes I do. Carbon credits have proved to be an attractive investment for many land owners over the past year the price has doubled from $35 per carbon unit to over $80 but if New Zealand's to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 exotic tree farming is a fast-track way to meet that goal. Probably in shorter-term exotic simply because they give us a much greater return on carbon and our immediate issue of course in New Zealand is that we've got to meet our liability by 2030 and again by 2050. And with a push toward native tree planting, biodiversity advisor for moldy forests, Doug McCready says there's another way for moldy to benefit. We are in Ontario, the land of the rainforest, the land that once had nothing but forest and birds. Whether it's exotic or native, what we've got here in Fakarewara forest, which is over 100 years old, is an example that both can coexist. It's thought to be the only Ewe base experiment where native trees are nurtured under a canopy of exotics. As we can see, a massive uptake of native undergrowth, a whole range of undergrowth species, including D'Iwadua, uh, including some canopy species, and this is all with no assistance to that transition. Basically we are in the middle of a transition of an exotic forest slowly becoming a native forest. Let us have the opportunity to lift ourselves up through this pathway, generate economic wealth, generate environmental benefits and generate the option for Mardi to then to then do something with our land which we which we currently currently can't. The consultation period for removing exotics from the permanent forest category closed this week. Newshub has approached the Forestry Minister Stuart Nash's office several times for an interview or statement, but as yet we've had no response. Terena Corfi. News hub. Councils say they've seen a growing problem with abandoned houses and buildings. It means in some areas dilapidated graffiti houses are sitting empty for decades, and there's very little that can be done about it. young, Jana Katuralan has more. This four-bedroom home smack-bang in the centre of a bustling Auckland suburb has sat empty for more than a decade. For as long as 14-year-old Annalena can remember, this has been her view. They asked me, where did you live? I'll just be like near the creepy house and they'll know immediately. There's been 16 complaints to the council about this Toyota 2 South Home with people concerned about rats and fire risk but it's not legal for the council to act. We don't have powers to just march on in and do something. It has to be quite a serious issue for us to actually respond to. It's only if the building could cause injury or death councils can move in. action might be possible if there's visible proof of a massive rat infestation or a major It's only if the building could cause injury or death, councils can move in. Action might be possible if there's visible proof of a massive rat infestation or a major fire risk because of haunted rubbish, but the bar is extremely high and councils are completely powerless if a building simply looks terrible. We tried to contact the owner of this home to ask why it sat like this for 12 years, but had no response. We believe he lives overseas and a search on the property's address revealed he also owns another home just down the road which is also uninhabited and in a similar state. Further south in Wanganui Mayor Hamish McDoull says absentee owners are responsible for the 10% of his city CDE buildings that are derelict. Some people are simply using these buildings as a financial finesse, some kind of tax exemption or tax-wrought, and they don't populate it, they don't look after the building, and it deteriorates. It's really demolition by neglect. So the council there is constantly fixing awnings and facades at its own cost. local Christine Tan Craig wanted to buy an abandoned building to convert to accommodation. is constantly fixing awnings and facades at its own cost. Local Christine Tancred wanted to buy an abandoned building to convert to accommodation, but she had to give up when the council couldn't find the owner. They don't know where they are, they go to wreck and ruin, and there's nothing anybody can can do about it. Local government, New Zealand, which represents councils, says they desperately need more powers to act. The problem is growing, there's no doubt about that. And at the moment, you know, we have our hands tied behind our backs. It wants a law to define derelict buildings like Ireland has. Then owners could be forced to fix or sell after a grace period. Could be a threshold of three years, five years. Then, action could be taken.-it's taking the demand to government this month. In the meantime, 14-year-old Anna Lela hopes the house next door will be bold and replaced before she leaves school and that she'll get some neighbours instead of this. Janika Turrellin News Hub.

The Warrittats can see there's a long way to go before they're able to match it with the Kiwis super-rug besides after the first Trans-Tasman clash ended in a comfortable 51-27 win for the Chiefs. And while the scoreline failed to show it, the Chiefs feel they've seen a huge jump in the Warriors skill set in the last 12 months and the crossover matches won't be as one-sided as some suggest. Rugby reporter Ollie Ritchie has more from Melbourne. It wasn't the bustling sold-out crowd super round organisers might have hoped for and for the thousands who poured into Amy Park the first of the Trans-Tasmine showdowns produced more of the same. The Keyways blew us away in the last 15 or 20 minutes like they've been doing for years so we've got to get on with fixing that. The Haps any chance of a fear contest was scuppered after just two minutes another red card this time to warritise prop Angus Bell for a dangerous tackle for a dangerous tackle. It put them on the back foot immediately and when they lost more front rowers to injury it meant uncontested scrums and a mix between props and halfbacks throwing into the line-out. It was always going to be difficult for them particularly losing two hookers. The line-out was trying to get bit creative there which was challenging for them. But even with that adversity the Waratars dug deep and trailed by just three after 50 minutes. Jake Gordon! And they're right back in it now the Waratars! An impressed chief's coach Clayton McMillan who's already seeing growth in the Ozzy game. Go back 12 months I reckon there's some obvious improvement in their game. Certainly look like a team that have a lot of belief in the direction that they're heading. The Waratars will take the complement but are not getting ahead of themselves. They know they're still well behind where they need to be. Coach Darren Coleman feels it's the final 15 to 20 minutes when New Zealand sides closed them out. Can they get one more row with the kicks, and lose to four?. Can they get one more row with the kipsroes and loaves to four? Cream rises as they say and we're not quite there yet. I guess Ozzy Coach has been trying to figure out that last 20 minutes against the Kiwis for years. They better sort it out quickly to avoid the last six weeks of Super Rugby being a trans-Tasbin whitewas for the Kiwis. Holly Ritchie joins us now from Melbourne, Are the Australian sides likely to fear any better tonight? Yeah, double header at Amy Park tonight. Nick, he kicks off of the blues against the Fijian Drew and it will be a tough ask for the drew to challenge the blues. They are riding high, of course after that big win against the Crusaders last week. Yes, they'd risk Captain Dalton, Dalton Papa Pupalee, but they are led by Bodom Barrett at first five. Outside him is Rochi Tuavasasas Shek, Rika Yuani is outside him. Not a bad midfield for the blues tonight, that is they will be expected to probably put a big score on the drua tonight. A little later on though we could see the first Australian victory. It is the hurricanes, hurricanes, up against the Reds over this side of the Tasmanman. That is very much seen as very much seen as one of the Tasmanian as one of the last one of the Reds, as one of the team as one of the team as one of the team as one of the team as one of the team as one of the team as one of the Tasman, that is very much seen as one of the matches that the Australian teams could tip the Kiwi sides up and of course no James O'Connor makes it very difficult for the Reds but the Hurricanes really have failed to get it going. They haven't been at their best so far in Super Raky so that match against the Reds will be a very interesting one tonight it could be the first to go the way of the Australians. Ollie Ritchie live there from Melbourne. Tyson Fury is promising war when he defends his WBC heavyweight title against fellow Brit Dillian White at a sold-out Wembley stadium tomorrow morning. The Gypsy King tipped the scales five kilos heavier than white for what he's calling his final heavyweight showdown and one worth waiting for. Once a showman, always a showman. You guys are f-f-f-f-b-b-b-b-b-! Fury is 5 kilos lighter than the career high 125 kilos that knocked out American Diante Wilder in the 11th round of an epic trilogy in Las Vegas last year. In theory it landed a beautiful right hand at the end of the round. In clear in contrast, contender Dylan White 10 kilos lighter on the scales and in his conduct. ironic given the body snatcher has been waiting years for a shot at a world title. I'm trying to get the job done. When I get the job done then I'll start acting crazy. Because it's been a year since White stepped into the ring, but he does so with respectable credentials, a professional record of 28 wins and two losses, including putting Kiwi Joseph Parker on the map for the first time in 2018. Fury pressing home his height advantage all the while selling the event to the 94,000 Wembley fans.

The 20 year old shared a photo of his knee post op along with this update.

Portia says he'll also be slowing down on social media while he recovers. Tilleg and former Kiwi Tamare Martin has staged a remarkable return to the NRL after three years on the sideline following a brain bleed. The 26-year-old starred for the Broncos as they fought their way back from 14-6 down against the Bulldogs with just 25 minutes to play. Brisbane piled on five tries in 21 minutes to win 34-14 and secure a fairy tale finish for Martin who was forced to retire just two years ago at the age of 24. Until it's gone and it's really gone for me and I've got the small opportunity to come up here with the Bronx and I've just taken them with two hands and really soaking it in because if anyone knows how how fast it can be gone it's me. Martin played the full 80 minutes at fall back making 147m of 15 runs and didn't miss a tackle in his first game back in 1,092 days. Well, finally tonight, the Wellington Phoenix are hoping history will be on their site when they run out against the Western Sydney Wanderers at Eden Park tomorrow afternoon. The Knicks have never lost a game at New Zealand's National Stadium with four wins and four draws. Coach Ufug Talli says the team's doing everything they can to keep it that way. I think the whole group is superstitious. We try to look back at what we did last season whilst we're up here but look. The thing is the reality is it's a game of football. It's a game of football, it's 11 v 11. Every game we want to go out there and try to win. But it's very important if we can't win that we don't lose as well and keep ourselves in the race till the end. That race for the playoffs is heating up with the next currently in fifth place with the next. with the Knicks currently in fifth place with four games remaining. A crowd of around 12,000 is expected for their second and final home game of the regular season. Meanwhile I think I might just be watching that blues drew a game tonight.

Oh, and what joy that brings me. I think that's the actor Nick Cage. Nick Cage? I love you! Anyone worried that the unbearable weight of massive talent uses Cage to play Cage as the butt of all its jokes, fear not. This is self-deprecating hom homage at its most entertaining. And dare I say it, it's most heartwarming. I'm done. I'm quitting acting. Cage, as cage, is bankrupt. His Hollywood cashier is fading. He's forced to take the big bucks to be the special guest at a superfans birthday party. Expecting to just smile and wave and take the money and run, instead he finds himself working for the CIA. His new friend, Harvey, holding it all together, their love of movies and ours. And who can't relate to that? This is an absolute delight and as Havi so rightly says, a gift bringing light and joy to an increasingly dark and broken world. Five stars. I'll sneak peek this week.

However, showers develop for Kai Korda. And in the North Island, it's fine in the eastern the eastern south tonight, but cloud and south, but cloud and south for everyone for everyone for everyone, and south for everyone else. Tomorrow a front arrives. Cloud builds, showers appear along with South Westallies. Patches are fine weather but it may pay to take an extra layer if you're heading out on the town. Let's take a closer look. It's a mixture of sunshine and showers for northern areas tomorrow. Those showers could get heavy at night time, especially for Hamilton and Auckland 20 degrees, the expected high hair.

And for the rest of the North Island it starts off okay for most here with a mix of showers and sunshine those showers become more frequent and heavy for new Plymouth. Moving to the South Island now and quite a bit of rain around tomorrow morning in the West but it clears to just showers in the afternoon with those fresh Southwesterlies. Okay let's head over the Alps and a bit more sunshine for the East but it does cloud over bringing showers with a southerly change. High here between 17 and 21 and a little messy for southern areas in the morning with rain. It will ease to showers though. That gusty southwesterly is back with highest floating between 13 and 15.
