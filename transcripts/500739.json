But in the tether of the government, there are run, the water, wazhi, if how are the ready of the Taitokkerrao? We've got some of our young Māori in our councils and they are making noise, they're pushing, they're part of design, they're part of objecting to the old white, you know, the resounding Māori voice just like, can't enough is enough. The co-oppa in the newtos of the councillors, the here's the Minister of Kāinga, Nanaia Mauta, to puttopu in the Wai, Nanaya Mahuta, to fom in the water from the counciles 17 to 4. What we have come to learn is that the train has left the station, so I think take the bloody water off them and thank you very much. You know, it's like yeah we own the water and I'm happy to have that discussion. And if systemically, if systemically this reform set gives us the opportunity to take it, own it and operate it, and be prepared to succeed and fail forward, then my oath and it back. And, you know, co-tow, the council's, cry at your own behest, cry somewhere else.

In the Takedokok to the Hiku, there's most definitely a bigger, Māi mood. And we said yes back in 1835 and 1840. So we're still inclined to say yes to anybody that decides to live here. But the rules of engagement must be fundamentally based on our our aspirations, our future. So, that's it. Tini Molyneau, Teau Marama. It was 16 years in the Waipew of the Waipew of the Arote of Tearrawa, then Taube Curtis, then heke in his own age. He was 282, a big one of the things he had, was the for the forerunaketang of their raw. At its time, it was time, $33 million, the new of the WEP, now, it's $107 million.

Let's see what you can do. Hey, we're going to clean it. Robot and Frank, Matagimai, Kifakata Mauri. This is an urgent appeal from Save the Children. Thousands of children are dying right now. Children like Dahir haven't eaten for days and are close to death. Without food or medical care, many children like Abdi won't survive. The severe drought that's hitting this part of Africa can no longer be ignored. If we don't act now, thousands more children will die. At Save the Children, we are doing all we can, but we urgently need your help to do more. We need to provide these children with emergency food, medical care, and fresh, clean water. Please call Save the Children on 0800-66-6694 or go online at save the children.org.n.z and give just $5 a month. If we don't act now, the situation will only get worse and more children will die. Please, will you help them? Thank you. It took me a long time to sort of get used to people calling me, sir, and it still feels a bit awkward. It's a great honour, isn't it, to be asked if you want to become a dame. Did you have to think about that? It's just like a hot flash. Pretty daunting to start with. Very humbled by getting the honour. Yeah, it's something you just don't take lightly. It's pretty daunting to start with. Comey.

If this call on the council, the council, there will be a treaty by Gai Tamarawah to the country to the HAPU. What's the what the thing for the question for Tauanga Moana? Our preference is for it is a recreational reserve. Gret Tim Bar-Wai-Wai the name of the co-oppa, chema-being for the water of the community, there's a way of the wai-hung-frae. However, heptow of Tommy Wilson, the care of a company for this tour of this arong. Keep it as a green open space where our people can come, walk, talk, wanang, much better than putting our houses because they won't be for our families. Our people can only afford to go talk, Wainananga, much better than putting our houses in there, because they won't be for our fauna. Our people can't afford to go up, low-cost, rent-a-own, we can't afford to go, with these fancy Hawaiian names around Tollanda. Sayan Toi, Aresi-Kaanga-o-toe is, he's in the council of Tauranga, are this work with the hapoo, the appanagan, and the community to the whole to get to do what it's all. The FDU Farr, one of the things that are there is to be not yet the the final of the council the councilor. By the Muruwen in the 1,800, the land the land the government. by the country council. By the maruwen, in the 1800, it was the land in the it was a place, a way, this country this were a a problem there's a there's a problem that time that Tamanawa we think the first consideration should be that the land is returned to us as the original owners. We've got to come to the centre of Tauranga, but they're not able to talk to the world. To safeguard our interests in this whole matter, we'veonise a claim of the Watanghi Tribunal which will come into effect if and when the Crown change the status of the recognise the councillor honour of Tauram.

It's the heir of the commisana, and Tawaine, there's a hell of the commisand, there's a favour of colour, a recognise treaty. I think that's taken a very reasonable position. If it's used for community purposes, they're very comfortable with that. If that changes, then they want to be having those conversations with the Crown. And I don't think as commissioners, we would have a problem with that. And I think it was very gallant of them not to pursue that in their treaty claim and accept that it was used for the wider good of the community. I mean, you know, that's really commendable of them. And must have taken some courage to come to that conclusion. So we do respect that. And we have, as I say, we have a good relationship and we'll keep talking with them as those plans unfold. He said, he said, I know, if we're going to have to to that ferokee, that's nother of the majority of the utu. I think they're right. You just imagine housing built overlooking a golf course or a big green space. It's more likely to be housing at an unaffordable level. It's more likely to be high quality housing. So I think they're right. And again, that's come through in the consultation that we've had from the wider community. Then, it's wakery, a town hoax, and it's also to the name, The Pucamata of Gapuhee, to unanswered, or more-hont of the people, or the members of the Iwiwi-we. The Rauke of the Pou-Takini this town, Iauwaha'all, and the forang to get uphush to the Al-Tuyho. Kyi, Tumama, Harawira, the long. The Poucafewan the poe-foucafidin'k the horse of Rhaehii to the place one. The centre, the programme to me, this is this is for the people who are from the people from organisations, to connect from the waver....cārable,...cāriwares, the group of the Poultakiri in the 2021, and the pae-paporey-hore-hout the work to do hosone in the iwi. To find out how our iwi can better engage with the age group, roughly between 18 to 35, and within that wannanga, there were a few ideas put forward, and one of them was, you need to put out there. says Iva Tereau Watkins, although a place this car was being on Tuy Hono, the more than to show to the people to see what they're going to the way to be in the way. To get to fit to talk, to, to, hono to their hapoo, to their marae, what are they going to go. Close to 85% of those that have faked up to gnappohi live outside of the Fari Tapu.

Shea, Anna, say, it's the young people to sure of the waihātouch motu. We need something that says Napaoie and she goes, what about the flag? And I said, oh no, the Teno flag is very, you know, pan-Maury. You know, it's very much Aultiara. And she goes, no, no, the independence flag. And I was like, te-carra. And it was just like, rainstorm moment. It's awesome. That is so Ta-Tukero, N Napao, we couldn't deny it. Hey, the 14th of Apirida, rewai, a Teau-Theriwai, and Te-Awarae, to bea-half. TENO-MALTACA, co-Rang-Put-Mau, and the Member of the Party The kaneatake-take-tore-t, the member of the Party-Karrike, on the 16th. Thank you. Come on me taking you to ride in this town. I have my skin addiction to me and also have a respiratory condition. And so I am a mask exemption. I previously had a respiratory virus that meant I had to go to hospital. And I'm scared that if I got COVID, I'd have the same outcome. For a healthy person, termed my life's only a few weeks, but for me, it will last a lot longer. So to keep myself and others with an attempt to stay, it's really important that you read your marks.
