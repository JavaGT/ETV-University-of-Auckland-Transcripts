I'm Bernardine Oliver Kirby. You are with AM early this Thursday morning. The Prime Minister has arrived in Tokyo as her first post-pandemic international trip continues. Jacinda Adirn touched on early this morning and was greeted on the tarmac by a small welcoming party. Because of the current COVID outbreak in Japan, the ceremony was restricted to only a few people. The entire delegation had to take saliva PCR tests on arrival. Three members of the delegation tested positive for COVID earlier in the week.

The search for a fisherman missing in the Bay of Plenty is set to enter its fifth day. A Coast Guard plane will conduct an aerial search of the coast from Waihi Beach to the Motu River mouth as well as the outlying islands.

Marine conservation groups are welcoming the decision to introduce catch limits for all species of finfish. Despite there being around a thousand different breeds, only 43 were being regulated, allowing some stocks to be overfished. Mikabana, who was leading the calls for change, believes the decision will ensure a brighter future for sea life. It's huge. I think at the end of the day, we've got fish stocks collapsing all around the country, and I think we need to be realistic about how many fish we take out of the ocean. The change has come into effect from May 5th. Europe is desperately trying to supply more aid to Ukraine as Murray-Upole hangs on by a thread. Troops in the port city have indicated that they won't survive the week. EU Council President Charles Michelle has met Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky as the violence escalates. Zelensky says if Ukraine doesn't fall to Russia, he'll accept all the help he can get when rebuilding his country. Sanctions, weapons, membership in the European Union and money. Things that we really need, things that we will for sure need after our victory to reconstruct our country. New United Nations data indicates that more than 5 million people have now fled Ukraine, most leaving through EU borders like Poland. Evacuations are underway in Arizona as strong winds and tinder-dry conditions fuel a ferocious wildfire. The blaze dubbed the Tunnel fire covers 6,000 acres and forced more than 2,000 residents to flee. 200 firefighters are on the scene, and like other southwestern states hit by climate change, Arizona is suffering an early start to its fire season. In sport, COVID-19 is again forcing disruptions for Super Rugby newcomers Moana Pacifica. Side were due to take the Western Force in this weekend's Magic Round in Melbourne. But cases in the force camp means the game has been postponed. It's a cruel setback for Moana Pacifica who've already seen multiple fixtures this season rescheduled with cases popping up in their own camp. Rugby is coming back to free-to-air TV with Spark Sport and World Rugby announcing Warner Bros. Discovery will be the broadcast partner for the upcoming Rugby World Cup. Eight of the tournament's 26 matches will be available to watch for free on TV 3, including both semifinals and the final live, along with delayed coverage of two quarterfinals and all three Blackfern's pool games. The cover delayed World Cup will take place in October and November with games being played in Auckland and Fangare. The Northern Stars have held on to claim their fourth win of the A&Z Premiership season in their first home match of the year. A well-drilled side were pushed all the way by the tactics before the stars thrashed them in the fourth quarter to record a 56-48 victory. Captain Maya Wilson continued her impressive form under the hoop scoring 31 goals from 34 attempts as the Northerners completed a clean sweep against the Cantabrians. Yeah, really stoked to finally be back at home. It feels like forever since we last played here, so really happy with that. And considering that was a way better game from both sides than last Saturday when we played them, so tactics came out to us, and I'm really glad we stood our ground.

Well, latest polling shows the National Party continuing to strengthen its numbers, both in party support and preferred leadership. To discuss the taxpayers' union poll, and other matters, I'm joined by ACT Party leader David Seymour. Good morning to you, David. Good morning, Bernardine. This is the second poll to show National in front of Labor with the party Māori as kingmaker. How are you seeing these numbers tracking? Act is dropping. How does that sit with you? Well, I mean, if you take this poll, Act went up five last time and down two this time, so I'd say we're going up. I think what really matters is that we've got a poll that shows the government is going to change, and Act is going to play a very significant part in any new government. We're actually polling higher than the last election, which was a record for us and very good for any third party. I think the real question that people will be looking at is, okay, if the government is going to change, will the change be real? Because for people who actually don't like the direction Labor's taking us in, we can't afford to have the next few years, if the government does change, spent, you know, betting in Jacinda's ideas the way that John Key basically bedded in Helen Clark's ideas over nine years. So I'm going to be saying, look, if we've got a cost of living crisis, if it's caused by excessive government spending, we've got to look at what we can actually commit to doing about that to reduce pressure on people who are being squeezed from every angle. If we've got a quiet change in our constitutional arrangements, we've got to ask what we're actually going to do to get back to one person, one vote, equality in New Zealand democracy. So I think it's a question of, yep, the trend is the government's going to change, but to what? And that's where Act has a lot to say. Well, you talk about the cost of living, and it's interesting the breakdown of these numbers. Nationals got increased support, but it's where their support lies, it's interesting. It seems to be the female voters that they're picking up on. Do you think this might be due to the increased cost of living in females being the big spenders in households? Well, anyone can speculate. I think what we know is that people of both genders are saying, I go to the petrol pump, I go to the supermarket. Everything I try to do, the price has gone up. But the real price that's gone up is actually housing where everybody's affected. You look at the increases in rent, interest rates now going up. People are just being squeezed from every direction. And the other thing that both genders do is pay a lot of tax. And that's why I'm saying, we actually need to ask, what are we doing with all this extra money? You know, we've gone up 14,000 bureaucrats. I'm not talking police. I'm not talking nurses. I'm not talking teachers. I'm talking back office people in Wellington. 14,000 extra people under Labor. The first thing we should do is go back to the number of bureaucrats or public servants that we had in Wellington four years ago, because I don't think New Zealand was that bad a place then. I don't see what extra value we're getting. We could save 1.2 billion of government spending by going back to the number of bureaucrats we had in 2017 when things weren't actually that bad. That's something that Adrian Orr is now helpfully saying if we want to get the cost of living crisis under control, then we've got to get government spending under control. And I think got to get government spending under control. And I think this government has spent far too much. They've slushed far too much money around in the economy. That's driving inflation. And that's why people are under pressure in so many areas. All right. So let's talk inflation. We're expecting an announcement this morning. It's highly tipped to peak at 7%. Grant Robertson's already said we have not seen the peak. Are you talking bureaucracy? You're talking about cuts in that area as a quick fix? Well, there's going to be no quick fix because this is built up over two years of excessive spending where Labor said that COVID is absolutely everything and forgot about every other priority that New Zealand has had. But I would start by looking at the growth in bureaucracy, the growth in expenditure, the growth in waste, and say, actually, we could afford to give the average worker back $2,000 by cutting the middle income tax rate straight away. That would give massive relief for people who are working, because at the moment, Labor's only idea for reducing pressure on families is to hand out more money when actually government spending is one of the things that is driving inflation. So we'd start letting people keep more of their own money, $2,000 on the average full-time worker that they get to keep in order to fight this cost of living crisis that's squeezing the middle from every angle. All right. Just finally, Anzack Day on Monday. We're all looking forward to another long weekend. Public holiday for us. You're looking forward to Matariki 2 in June? Look, it's a question of priorities. I mean, who isn't looking forward to a day off? But we've got, from a point of view of an employer, four weeks annual leave, now 10 days, sick leave, now 11 public holidays. We're not going to get ahead when you have a government whose biggest priority is new public holidays. I'm really pleased to see that the NACS have started taking the position that we took last year. If you're going to have an extra public holiday, then you need to remove one of the ones you've already got because people just can't afford Labor's continued indulgence. Yes, I think Mr Luxens come out saying he was facetious in saying get rid of Labor Day, but do appreciate it is coming at a great expense for small business. Act Party leader, David Seymour, thanks for your time. Thank you. Exciting news coming out of the sporting world today. Warner Brothers Discovery has announced it's partnering with Spark Sport to air the 2021 Rugby World Cup this year. Joining me now to chat about this as head of Spark Sport, Jeff Latch. Good morning to you, Jeff. Fantastic news. And it's been a long time coming, hasn't it? We've had a delay of a year due to COVID. We have, Bernie. It is fantastic news. Spark Sport are enormously proud to be bringing the Rugby World Cup 21 to New Zealand households in partnership with Warner Brothers Discovery New Zealand. Honestly, it's fantastic. So many games will be covered. What will free-to-air viewers get to see? Those on TV 3, what kind of games are they going to see? They're going to see eight of the most important games. So they're going to see the two semis and the final live. So there'll be summer cast live on TV3 as well as on Spark Sport. They're also going to have two quarterfinals delayed. And also the three Black Ferns pool matches are all going to play delayed on TV3. So it's a pretty impressive spread of matches. And isn't the nation ready for some live sport and some feel-good factor? And for the first time on home soil for the rugby World Cup. Absolutely. And, you know, I think the whole country is going to get him behind the Black Ferns. I think it's going to be a magic tournament. I know Michelle and her team down in World Rugby are doing an awesome job in getting ready for the tournament. We have had an extra year to build up to it, which is really cool. And I think if you think of the legacy of the Black Ferns and their five World Cup victories, I mean, what other sports team can talk about five World Cup victories? I mean, it's just outstanding. And if we can build on that legacy here in New Zealand, the country embraces it, I think it's going to be a fantastic event. And I think the spectacle for fans, and not even rugby fans, just sporting fans in general, it's not just the Black Ferns. You've got some very high calibre teams coming here. You've got England, France, Ireland. That's going to be an exciting prospect on our back doorstep. Well, it is and the quality of the rugby is just getting better globally year after year after year. So I actually think the matchups and the competition is going to be absolutely intense. And what a magic year for sport in New Zealand to have two world cards, but particularly women's sport. I mean, this is such a land-breaking year. I just, yeah, it's awesome. We've seen Super Rugby all-picky, huge success there. And the female numbers undoubtedly are really boring up the overall numbers. So it's my girls playing rugby, so it is really huge in this nation for females. Yes. And I think it's getting bigger. And I think that both, my girls playing rugby, so it is really huge in this nation, four females. Yes. And I think it's getting bigger. And I think that growth, this tournament should spur more growth. It should explore more interest in the sport. Honestly, I think this is just a great event for New Zealand and we are incredibly proud to working with you guys and bringing it to the New Zealand households. We are so excited. We know the keywords of get on board. Can you give us a sense of occasion from an operational point of view? This is going to be a really massive event to cover. Can you give us a sense of the gravitas, how big it's going to be? Okay, so the host broadcast has been handled by World Rugby themselves in exactly the same way they did Rugby World Cup 2019, the men's Rugby World Cup. So they're bringing the same team, the same resource that they brought to that coverage, to the coverage in New Zealand. So it's going to be world-class coverage. A lot of New Zealanders are actually playing key roles in the production. And so I think we can be very confident that the coverage is just going to be the best that you would expect to see coming out of New Zealand. Well, you might have some of us volunteering on the gate to get people into the grounds. Because it's Fungare and Auckland. Yes. And what kind of times are we looking at? Have they been set yet for coverage? They have put out the schedule. And there's going to be two to three matches per day, depending on the stage of the tournament. And so they will start in the afternoon and they'll culminate in a night match. And so the times are going to be good for people to view, right? But I think the big thing is I think we all want everyone in New Zealand to go along to the matches as well. We want to have packed stadiums and I think we'll break the world record for people coming along and watching a women's rugby world cup match, which would be just a cool thing to happen here in our backyard. And those who can't, the free-to-air partnership means it's more accessible to so many more Kiwis. Correct. And the coverage will be first class. It will do. Well, we're really excited to team up. So thank you. And Black Ferns? Yes. Defending? Absolutely. All the way. Head of Sparks, Waltz. Jeff Latch. Thanks for joining us this morning. Cheers.

Time now to check in with our reporters around the country, and it is Morena to Mitch Redmond in Christchurch. Mitch, you've got some bad news on the weatherfront for West Coasters. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. Buckets of rain are once again expected over on the West Coast today, with the possibility of further slips and flooding that we've seen so many times this year already. An active orange alert is in place for Buller, Westland and Fjordland for most of today, with some of those warnings stretching into tomorrow morning as well. Now, the last time an Orange Alert was in place in Buller, there was widespread flooding and evacuations taking place, so residents and officials will be hoping that that's not the case once again today. Now West Coast Emergency Management is urging people to get in touch if they do run into any troubles and they are saying that they are there if people do require some assistance. But at the moment being, spirits do appear to be high. In a Facebook post, Hokitika Golf Club commented that their course is looking a little thirsty and could do with some greening up. So hopefully those good vibes continue today and the rain doesn't cause too many issues. Absolutely. Thank you, Mitch. Let's now head to Tia McDougal and Auckland. Morena Tea. We might be going on a break a long weekend this weekend, but Maura Peehu certainly isn't. No, no, Morena Bernardine. Residents of Ruehupihu are poised and ready because Mount Luapu has had its longest shaking period in 20 years. For a month now, volcanic tremors have been detected at the summit and in the crater lake. Geonet most recently recorded the crater lake temperature at about 37 degrees and the alert remains at level two. But they are still concerned because the ongoing tremors is never a good sign. So if you are in the area, just be aware. Be aware, absolutely. All right, thanks for that. Those are our AM reporters tear and Mitch. That was AM early. It is four minutes to six."}
