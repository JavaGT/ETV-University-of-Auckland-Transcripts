The Governor of New Zealand, Lord Plunkett, issued an order at Government House. For five years from that date, it became unlawful for any person to take a Rissos dolphin in the waters of Cook Strait. New Zealand became the only country in the world to pass legislation to protect what was to many a national pet, Polaris Jack. Jack first appeared around 1890. He was a loner who met ships at Polaris Sound and escorted them to French Pass. His reputation was international. Writers from America and England wanted confirmation of his exploits and Mark Twain even came to see for himself. The New Zealand School Journal of 1926 retold the story of Polaris Jack and engaged the imagination of a new generation. How do we know this? Because it's in the archives."}
