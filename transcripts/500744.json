Is the government doing anything to try and rain it in? Calls for a national inquiry into port safety after another worker dies at the ports of Auckland. The Prime Minister's first overseas trip in two years hits a COVID-en-forced snag. And a major legal cannabis operation is underway in Ruatoria. Kiyo-da, good evening. Inflations predicted to hit hellish heights later this week after already seeing its biggest annual jump just months ago. It comes as Kiwis continue to fork out more and more just to get by. Political reporter Imogen Wales has more. Filling your trolleys about to get that much more expensive, as if things weren't already hard enough. It's quite bad in New Zealand. We'd probably buy less luxuries than we would previously. I'm selling a lot of furniture in my house to make extra money. Our inflation rates tipped to hit 7% later this week, the worst it's been since the late 80s. Well, it doesn't matter whether it's 6, 7 or 8. It's either way you slice and dice it, it's a hellish of a high number. Inflation is a thief that literally siphons money out of your pocket. Pockets already feeling the pinch in the last 12 months, Kiwis have on average spent an extra $4,000 to $5,000 on basics like food, rent and fuel. Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr is crying out for more targeted fiscal policies. We're not in a great place now. We need to tighten monetary conditions. Nationals calling on the government to hit pause on what it calls wasteful spending, with budget 2022 just round the corner and the finance minister giving himself $6 billion in new cash to splash. A credible finance minister would be doing all he could to rein in inflation right now because it's driving a cost of living crisis for all New Zealanders. But the finance minister says the reasons behind our cost of living crisis are imported from overseas, not our own spending, pointing the finger at the crisis in Ukraine and the global pandemic. We've got to continue to be balanced in the way that we approach our government spending. It is important that we don't cut our nose off despite our face and take away funding. It's really important. He's been trying to claim that he can't do anything to impact inflation. Well, of course he can. We're not going to reduce the price of food at the supermarket by cutting health spending. Perhaps not, but something's got to give. Okay, Imogen, when can we expect to see that new inflation rate? So that'll be later this week on Thursday when the new consumer price index figures come out, giving us a measure of inflation for Kiwi households. This really is shaping up to be the political battle of the year. Cost of living crisis is a phrase we hear almost daily now and it's one that will certainly be front of mind for the finance minister in the buildup to Budget Day 2022 which is now exactly one month away and while he remained tight-lipped today the 19th of May will be when we see whether or not he's going to pull anything out of the bag to help ease this pressure on pockets. Imogen, thank you. The Maritime Union is calling for a national inquiry into port safety following the death of a worker at Auckland's port this morning. The man, a stevedore employed by a private company, fell from a height during the loading and unloading of freight. Alice Wilkins reports. Nestled in between the usual weekday activity at our biggest port, these ambulances, were a telltale sign that something had gone very wrong. St John's staff packing up because there was nothing more they could do, a worker had been killed on the job. I do understand he's a young port worker, and it should be a tragic story. I think there's a family involved as well. The man was a stevedore working for Wallace Investments, an independent stevedoring company that operates at the port. In a statement today it said the company and staff are devastated by today's incident and our immediate thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased. The company will be undertaking its own investigation into the incident and will fully cooperate with maritime NZ and their investigation. The death occurred when the Stevador fell from a height. It's understood he was working on board the Singaporean flagged container ship Capitan Tasman at the time, but authorities are still working to establish exactly how the accident happened. Police could be seen inspecting the ship this morning. Ports of Auckland says work on the vessel stopped immediately. Ships are all made of steel, so there's no soft landings from any height or any fall at all. They would have been using ships' cranes to discharge and load containers, and that sounds like where the injuries happened. Auckland Port has come under harsh scrutiny in recent years with three other deaths since 2017, including swimmer Leslie Galberger who was struck by a pilot boat and Palamo Kalati, who was crushed by a container on a ship. In 2021, an independent review into health and safety at Auckland Port identified systemic problems and trust gaps. When I saw Amo's family, the family said to me, Tony, how can you make sure that this never happens again? And I'm going to make sure that never happens again. But Maritime Union National Secretary Craig Harrison says today's tragedy is slightly different because it involves a private company. He wants a national inquiry into port safety on the whole. The industry's crying out for a real look at what's been going on and in the recent years with port congestion and the supply chain, people are working a massive amount of hours and the pressure is on to keep working. And today's death is yet another example of tragedy at our ports on what should have been just another morning at work. Okay, Alice, the man who died worked for Wallace investments, a private company. So does the port bear any responsibility here? Well, ports of Auckland wouldn't go on camera today, as the incident didn't involve one of its staff members, but provided a statement saying that the port has the ultimate responsibility for anyone who goes on site. It will support the investigations of Maritime New Zealand and Wallace investments, as well as any corrective action being put in place. Ellis Wilkins, thanks for the update. Ukraine's president says the second phase of the war has started with Russian forces beginning the much-anticipated battle for Donbass in the east. It comes after Russia launched a deadly attack overnight, firing missiles at targets across the country, including the western city of Leviv, where hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled for safety from Putin's invasion. Europe correspondent, Lesothar, reports. Russia terrorized the north. It is still strangling the south. And tonight, President Zelensky declared that what is promising to be the most ferocious fight of all, the fight for the east, has just begun. We can now say that Russian forces have started the Battle of Donbass. A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive, he announced. It was the West, though, this morning that had its safety exploded. This mother had escaped to the safe haven of Lviv with her son, but Putin's missiles found her boy there too. There was a powerful explosion. The window smashed, his mother says. He lost half a finger. Just three years old, he is the youngest of 11 injured today. At least seven others were killed. Just an hour from the safety of the EU border, its skyline hadn't seen terror like this until this morning. We mourn the dead and we must be as vigilant as possible, because it seems like the enemy is getting wilder, and the number of hits on civilians will increase. Military targets were hit, but so was this auto mechanic shop. Russians, what have you done, this woman pleads, and as he handed over EU candidacy papers, President Zelensky answered her question, it is nothing but deliberate terror, he said. That terror is intensifying everywhere. Russian rockets rained down on more than 300 sites across Ukraine today. In Kharkiv, three people were killed. Kiev suspects Putin will be looking for payback after his prize warships sank in the Black Sea, the first unverified images of which emerged today. Ukraine continues to claim responsibility for its destruction and is promising its people have more fight left in them still. In London, Lisset Raymond Newsub. The Prime Minister's first post-pandemic international trip is off to a rocky start, with three members of the delegation testing positive for COVID-19. Although they're old infections, they won't be able to travel to Japan, but it won't get in the way of a busy first day in Singapore. Here's political reporter Amelia Wade. The grandest of welcomes after two years locked in. Welcome to Singapore. Welcome to the Astana Palace. And welcome back to grip and grins. Even in the rarest of moments, masks come off for a greeting with a grin. A delicate pink orchid named Jacinda Ardenne to mark the occasion. Thank you. I welcome Prime Minister Arden back to Singapore. Very happy that she's made Singapore her first overseas visit since the onset of COVID-19. But behind the scenes, COVID looms large, a reality of pandemic diplomacy. The whole world is in a transition right now. Up to our third test as part of this trip. The world isn't quite back to normal. And it's edging closer last night. The entire almost 50 strong delegation got super sensitive PCR nasal tests. The PM2, a requirement to get into Japan. I'm very pleased to confirm that I have returned a negative PCR test and will be travelling on to Tokyo. Three weren't so lucky. Two from the business group and one from the Defence Force aircrew, testing positive for old infections. They'll be left behind, but the vibe still high about actually being overseas. It is fantastic to be able to pick up again what has previously been such an important part of this job, and that is promoting New Zealand's interests abroad. COVID, not the only sea word front of mind in the face-to-face, chief to chief, China coming up to. It's fair to say that we are living an increasingly complex part of the world and have been for some time. And, of course, the war. There is pressure on our rules-based order. It has been threatened and disrupted and upended by the actions of Russia. This trip is much about building relationships as it is about promoting New Zealand. The Prime Minister using her first day to ever so slightly expand the working holiday scheme to let more Singaporean backpackers in. To encourage people to come and visit our part of the world because we are open for business. Open for business, finally. So Amelia, the government's just announced some more sanctions against Russia. That's right here at the Astana in Singapore. The joint press conference with both prime ministers has just wrapped up. Both prime ministers have just wrapped up. Both prime ministers have condemned Russia's actions and committed to encouraging China to acknowledge the impact that the conflict has had on the world. But back on home soil, the government is doing all it can to apply pressure to Putin. It's just rolled out a whole suite of new sanctions against 18 financial institutions, including eight of Russia's largest banks. The move means that now 80% of Russia's total assets are now subject to sanctions in New Zealand. Amelia Tenakwe. Our COVID numbers continue to decline. There were just over 8,200 new cases reported today. Five people with the virus have died, taking our total reported deaths from the two-year pandemic to 602. 572 people are currently battling COVID in hospital. 19 of those are an ICU or a high dependency unit. An internal memo from the Ministry of Health's revealed there was no longer any health justification for MIQ way back in November last year, meaning stranded Kiwis could have come home for Christmas. Political editor Jenna Lynch joins us now. Jenna, why is this only come out now? Well, the short answer is the Ministry of Health didn't want it out there, tried to keep it secret, refusing to release it under the Official Information Act, until its hand was forced by the Ombudsman. This memo dated the 12th of November last year, is written by Dr. Carolyn McElnay, Dr Bloomfield's off-sider, and expressly states that the risk of international arrivals transmitting COVID-19 was no longer greater than the risk of domestic transmission. Translation, the risk at the border, was no longer greater than the risk of spread in Auckland. But the extra damning thing here is that given the context of the Delta outbreak at the time, the fact that there was ongoing transmission in Auckland and jumping across its border, the fact that we had 80% of us double vaccinated and we had a vaccine requirement in place for travellers, health officials agreed back then that MIQ was no longer justified on a public health basis, but still it remained in place over Christmas. Now obviously after that, the Omicron wave changed everything, but this will be difficult to hear for the thousands of Kiwis that battled a cruel lottery just to try and see their families for Christmas. Jenna, thank you. Well, Heather's here with today's weather, which was warm around the country. Yeah, well above April's average. Auckland took the top tent today with 25.6 degrees, normally 21 at this time of the year. Now, the warm weather will continue tomorrow and Thursday, too, with overnight temperatures expected to be up to 10 degrees warmer than normal tonight. But it won't last with a cool change arriving before the weekend. More details coming up after sport. Thanks Heather.

Auckland Council has released its draft plan to allow for more high-density housing. It includes buildings of six stories or more within walking distance of the city centre, and that's just the start. Shannon Redstool has the details, and Shannon, what could the changes look like? Well, Laura, many of Auckland suburbs could look quite different in the coming decades. Auckland Council has released its proposed unitary plan, which would allow for buildings of up to six stories or more to be constructed in walkable areas. Now, these are places that are up to 15 minutes walk from the CBD, up to 15 minutes walk from 10 of Auckland's larger suburbs, places like Albany, Henderson and Newmarket, or places that are up to 10 minutes walk from major public transport like the trains and the northern bus lanes. These changes will also allow for housing up to three stories to be built in almost all of Auckland suburbs, but it does particularly impact places closer to the CBD and may result in the loss of some heritage homes. Okay, Shannon, is there anything people can do about this if they don't like the plan? Well, residents have the option to give their feedback from today through until May the 9th, but there are limited changes that can be made because this housing intensification has been mandated by the central government. Shannon, thanks for the update. Police say they expected a post-mortem on chaos price to be completed today. The 22-year-old was shot dead by police after ramming his car into their vehicle on State Highway 3 near New Plymouth on Saturday night. They've examined several vehicles and spoken to members of the public who witnessed the incident. Three children were injured when a car plowed into a building hosting a school holiday program. Emergency services were calls to the scene at Promise School in Browns Bay on Auckland's North Shore this morning. Two children were transported to Starship Hospital, one in Browns Bay on Auckland's North Shore this morning. Two children were transported to Starship Hospital, one in a serious condition and the other in a moderate condition. With our ocean border still closed to cruise ships, nearly 200 port bookings have had to be cancelled this year. The industry is begging for a reopening date, but the government is holding off over COVID concerns. At the same time, Australia is cruising towards a billion dollar cash injection. Kelly Callahan reports. Cruising back into Australia. We'd like to welcome you back to Australian waters. Thank you very much. Thanks for inviting us home. P&O's Pacific Explorer making a spectacular return into Sydney Harbour, the first international ship there in two years. Australia is one of 80 countries opening their borders to cruise ships, but we're not. Cruise ships are unable to be confirmed, and we're already losing more than 180 port bookings. Leaving our ports empty, and it may stay that way if a reopening date for cruise ships isn't announced soon. Cruise is what to cruise and if they can't cruise around New Zealand I'll cruise elsewhere. The government is waiting on advice from health officials before making a decision. The Ruby Princess was linked to the devastating Hawks Bay cluster in early 2020. It then sailed on to Australia carrying hundreds of cases and led to the deaths of 28 people. We're all aware of the role that cruise ships played in the early days of the pandemic, and there's still a concern that they operate in slightly different ways than the air travel and the air border does. That was two years ago, and next week the face of our cruise industry will be hoping to promote New Zealand week the face of our cruise industry will be hoping to promote New Zealand to the world's largest cruise conference. For New Zealand, namely me, will be standing up, I hope not to, but standing up with a great deal of embarrassment in saying, look, we're not open yet and we don't know when. The government says a decision is just weeks away. Kaley Callahan, NewsHub. Americans can now fly mask-free after a federal judge quashed the government's travel mask mandate. The decision also applies to airports, trains, taxis and transport hubs. The judge accepted masks limit the spread of COVID but ruled the mandate was unlawful as the Centre for Disease Control had exceeded its authority and failed to follow proper lawmaking. White House Press Secretary Jen Sarky called the decision disappointing. Norel is in shortly with sport and it was a big win for Joelle King today. Yeah, a great win and an emotional one too.

He's taking over the role from Matthew Tukaki, who has been chair since its inception and has said he was planning to step down for months. This appointment follows a report from the advisory board highlighting a need for substantial change within the organisation. Parr Mark says he is honoured to lead the board's ongoing work to reform the child protection system. A medicinal cannabis company and Ruatoria has launched its first product, a CBD oil called CBD 100. As Keisha Brownlee reports, CBD oil is commonly used for pain and anxiety disorders. The handful of medicinal cannabis products available in New Zealand is growing. It's been a long time coming. Rua Bioscience has just launched its first product. CBD-100, a cannabis oil available on prescription only. The company's based in Rua Torre, a rural town on the east coast of the North Island, 130 kilometres north of Gisbon. If you had to ask this 15 years ago, it would have been laughed at, I suppose, having a pharmaceutical company located on the East Coast. To build an indoor and outdoor cultivation centre at, you know, that the standards that are required to produce medicine in Ruaturia, was not, you know, was not an easy job. Ruatoria was once infamous for growing cannabis. It's now It's an icon if you like on State Highway 35 that shows that there is that investment in the region. More than half of Rua Bioscience's 40 employees, Faka Papa, were some specialists brought in from elsewhere. The benefits of this medicine span far beyond the ailments that it helps. One of the founding Kaupapa of the company was to be able to create pathways, not only for Farno or people in need to access the medicine, but also for Farno who had been growing for decades to come into a legal construct and to be able to create income for those families. Rua Bioscience has also launched New Zealand's first compassionate access scheme for medicinal cannabis. Under this scheme, the medicine will be available at no cost for a limited number of qualifying people in Te Tairaafiti, depending on their clinical need and circumstances. Essentially it comes off our bottom line, but that is a social commitment that we've made to the patient community in Teirafati and in time to Altairer. Local knowledge removing barriers to better health and economic growth. Kasha Brownlee, News Hub. Two British men captured by Russian forces while fighting for the Ukrainian army have appeared on Russian state TV. It's unclear if the men were speaking under duress, but both appealed to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to secure their release in exchange for a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who is facing treason charges. If Boris Johnson really does care like he says he does about British citizens, then he would help pressure Selensky to do the right thing and return Victor to his family and return us to our families. The politicians also been in front of the camera, and this video released yesterday by Ukraine's Secretary Service, he asked for his release in exchange for a humanitarian corridor in Maripole. Parents are being warned their children's health is at risk if they use cell phones late at night. Alarming research in Australia has found even eight-year-olds are losing sleep by texting well after bedtime. Channel 7, Sonia Marinelli reports. Just ask any teenager late-night phone use is all the rage. And how often do you use it? Every night. It definitely promotes us to stay more awake. It kind of distracts us from sleeping. I call it the social media sushi train, where it just goes around and around. 250,000 Aussie kids were quizzed on their bedtime phone habits, almost a third of 8 to 11 year olds, more than half of 12 to 14 year olds, and 4 out of 5, 15 to 18 year olds admitted to texting after 10pm at least once a week. And more phone play equals less shut-eye. What we can say from our study is that the chances of them getting eight hours of sleep was smaller if they had used their phone at night. While short of the 8 to 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep recommended by experts. The content switches our brain on. It's not a lullaby. Tide children may be hyperactive, less attentive and struggle to regulate emotions. They can also be accessing content, which can be emotionally arousing, distressing. So not only can impact on sleep can possibly impact on mental wellbeing. Further research has shown that when mobile phones are kept out of the bedroom at night, not only do children sleep for longer, but their quality of sleep also improves. The kind of old school way of saying, well, just put it down, I'll just turn it off or just tell your friends you're busy, isn't going to cut it.

It's the 33-year-old's first victory on the circuit in nearly three years, and she's determined to replicate her winning formula for the rest of 2022. Natasha Payne reports. This was the moment that years of hard work finally paid off. Thoroughly deserved with the way that she's battled through. Jowell King managed to win her second Manchester Open and her first ever event since 2019, beating England's Sarah Jane Perry. To be at this point winning a tournament against the calibre of players that we have on tour, I mean so much. The World Number 6 started strongly, winning the first game 11-8. Good start though for King. She continued to attack, much to the annoyance of her opponent. The line's here. That's not short. That's not wrong. Raise my mind. The ball is gone. It's steep behind you. It's not short and it's not wrong. She won in three straight games, the significance of the victory clear. I'm actually quite emotional because it's... Sorry. It's... King spent the last few years in the UK training and playing away from family and says the victory was as much for them. This is what all the sacrifice has been for. That's why I stayed on this side of the world so far away. She's now been given a huge confidence boost for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July. But it's next month's World Championship, which has her full attention. Everyone at the top of their minds is the World Championships, which is fast approaching. There is a few tournaments leading up, but I'm choosing to miss them and stay here and train and get ready. And she hopes that approach will help her get the better of her biggest rival on the circuit again. Natasha Payne, News Hub. Has rugby gone soft? That's what One All Black is asking after another weekend of Super Rugby Pacific was plagued by red cards for contact with the head. Scott Barrett, Josh Dixon and Asafawa Mowa have all been handed lengthy bans, leaving their teams under strength going into this week's first trans-Tasman round in Melbourne. Gordon Finlayter has more. It continues to be an ugly trend in Super Rugby Pacific. It's a direct shoulder to their head with a high level of danger. It's a red card. This high shot means the Highlanders will be without Josh Dixon for three weeks, but one of his teammates is sympathetic. Super's probably a wee bit soft on the red cards. And if you slow-mo down every tackle down, they all look like head knocks. The bigger suspension was handed to Scott Barrett. Oh no. His red car defence on Friday night resulted in a four-week ban. While the hurricanes will be without Asafo Armour for three weeks, following this shot on Gareth Evans, which resulted in a black eye. If you don't quite get it right, people can get hurt. And so I don't think it's gone soft. I just think we're trying to make it as safe as possible. And then And so I don't think it's gone soft. I just think we're trying to make it as safe as possible. And then you've got a chop tackler that's taking the legs and then that second guy coming in can potentially catch the head, which I think is a part of rugby. And it clearly has been this season. The red cards and suspensions have been flying for weeks. We have to be better because we can't have guys getting hit in the head. But they still are. We're not out there trying to hit someone in the head on purpose, you know. It's just the way the rules are and it's unlucky if you get found out. Sometimes it happens and you get away of some stuff. But with more cameras than ever and player safety the main priority for referees, there could be more reds until players finally start hitting lower. Gordon Findlayter, Newsub. The Wellington Phoenix admit they're in must-win territory, heading into this weekend's clash against the Western Sydney Wanderers. They've just landed in Auckland following Sunday's 4-0 defeat to the Central Coast Mariners in the capital, which has left the next fifth on the table, with only the top four teams earning a home elimination final. Despite the result, Phoenix attacking midfielder Reno Piscopo is hopeful they can bounce back. We're very confident. We hope we can make top four and then play a couple of games back home again. We've missed out on that all year. So every game, like we said, we want the three points. This week's like a final for us and we're hungry to win. The Knicks are just one point of fourth place. Manchester United Star Cristiano Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez have announced that their baby boy has passed away. The couple were expecting twins but only one survived. In a statement posted to Twitter the couple said it was the greatest pain that any parents can feel, but the birth of their baby girl gives us great strength to live through this moment with some hope and happiness. Well, the West Tigers' first win of the NRL season has been worth the weight with an epic 2120 upset victory over the Parramatta Eels. With the scores locked at 20 all, and with time on the clock counting down, playmaker Jackson Hastings stepped up to steer the Tigers to a one-point victory. For the win, Hastings! He's kicked it. He got it. He got it. Jackson Hastings wins the game. And the rugby league guards finally sh on Michael McGuire and the West's Tigers. The last five weeks haven't been good enough. I suppose coach is under pressure, clubs under pressure. And there's only one way to show that you care about someone or something. Let's go out there and put a performance on. We finally did it. The result lifts the tigers off the foot of the ladder, while the ails remain in fourth place. Just months after settling into the seat as New Zealand Olympic Committee boss, Nikki Nickel has already set some major targets. Having previously worked for New Zealand rugby, she succeeded Karen Smith off the back of the country's most successful summer and winter games and Nichols determined to build off that by hosting a games here. Alex Chapman reports. Nikki Nichol has an aspirational goal. I would love New Zealand to host a Commonwealth Games. The new Olympic boss wants to show off New Zealand. 2030 or 34? Oh, look, it's probably too early to say, but we certainly be really keen to start having some conversations around what that could look like now that there's a new formula and how that can be run. That formula is a preference for regions or even countries to host Commonwealth Games rather than just cities and Nicol wants to put a Kiwi spin on it. Only swimming and athletics are compulsory as part of games bids for Commonwealth Games. So it does give us opportunities to bring in sports that Kiwis have done quite well under the past two. Like what? Like rowing and canoeing. For now though, with the Birmingham Games 100 days away, Nicol has the both daunting and exciting task of guiding a New Zealand team just months after taking over. That's not the only intimidating job, though, replacing Karen Smith, a trailblazer for the Olympic movement. If she wants some guidance, though, on what makes a good CEO, Nicol doesn't have to look too far. For me, it's just having that good relationship with athletes, making sure that they listen and try and help them as much as possible. At the end of the day, everybody wants medals, we want medals as well. It's just making sure that we do it in the right way. The cost of success on athlete well-being has been a big focus recently. It's something Nicol wants to address as well. Add that to the list alongside a potential home games. Alex Chapman, Newsub. Finally tonight, just weeks after announcing her shock retirement from tennis at just 25, Ash Barty is switching her tennis racket for golf clubs. The Australian Open Champion has reportedly agreed to take part in the ICON series in late June. It's a nine-hole exhibition tournament, which will feature other high-profile sports stars like England football striker Harry Kane. Let's be honest guys, we all knew that she would be back in some way, shape or form and I actually might have to watch that. Yeah, absolutely. Far too young, far too good, just to completely disappear. Thanks very much, Norel. A British man has landed a dream job appointed official ale-taster of Congleton in Cheshire. The role is part of the town's 750th anniversary celebrations. It was an important job back then, but as Yasmin Baudalbae reports, nowadays the ale taster has fewer duties apart from, well, tasting. Congleton takes its beer very seriously. Hail, Cogleton's ale taster. The ancient job of checking it's all up to scratch has been resurrected. That's perfect. And given to Benedict Goodale. And no, that's not his real name. Sorry. Spot on. Do you have the best job in the world? Well, I think that's undoubtedly true. In the past, drinking water was dangerous, so everyone, including children, drank beer. The ale taster was a kind of trading standards officer. The historic role of the ale chaster, excuse me, was a combination of weights and measures and trading standards. So they were responsible for ensuring that the ingredients used in the beer were of a fine quality and that they were brewed to the right strength. In fact, Benedict's role is part of celebrations to mark 750 years since the town received its charter and was first allowed to appoint an ale taster. Before you get too jealous, though, it could be a poison chalice. There's a very good chance that the ale might be stale. It certainly might be have salt in it to make you drink more of it. And the stuff that was used for ale in that time was maybe not quite as good as the stuff that we have nowadays. No such worries for Benedict. It is a matter of pacing oneself. You clearly can't taste ale all day. After a difficult couple of years for pubs, he and his medieval friends hope they can lure people back in. Cheers. Tough gig. Burma, the country's last remaining Asian elephant will no longer be moving across the ditch. After months of planning, Queensland's Australia Zoo has pulled out just one week before the transfer was due to take place. In 2020, Auckland Zoo announced their remaining elephants would be rehomed because of concerns for their health. Auckland Zoo says it's immensely disappointing and will take a significant time to explore alternatives to rehome Burma. Johnny Depp's doctor has described helping to find the actor's severed fingertip, as Depp's defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard continues. Depp claims he sustained the injury in 2015 when heard through a bottle of vodka at him, although Dr. David Kipper testified the Edward Sizzahan Star, sliced it off himself with a knife. Was the tip of the finger found? It was found. Who found it? I believe this man was their chef. Depp suing heard for $75 million, alleging she defamed him by saying she was a survivor of domestic violence and a 2018 article for the Washington Post. A woman in Argentina has cheated death after fainting and falling under a moving train. CCTV footage captured the moment the woman lost consciousness and to the horror of onlookers staggered headfirst into the side of the train falling between the side of a carriage and the platform. Incredibly, rescuers were able to quickly extract her and take her to hospital. The woman was later discharged without significant injury. She told an Argentinian TV station she didn't remember anything of her ordeal after trying to tell a man she was about to faint. Well, these are our top stories tonight.

Kiyo-ro, welcome back. A few unsettled days ahead for the school holidays. As the ridge of high pressure slowly heads offshore. And what's left, well, it's messy weather. There's a complex trough and a series of fronts moving on to the southern part of the country from the Tasman. A slow-moving front lingers over the upper North Island, and there's wind with northerly strengthening too. So, at Fortewe-Wai, Ponaumu, the South Island, showers remain tonight over the north and northwest, and then tomorrow that rain gets heavy with afternoon thunderstorms as per the weather warnings and watches. East of the divide, it's fine, but scattered rain spreads in the southeast. For Teika, Amawi, the North Island, well, you'll experience some rain and thunderstorms tonight all north and east of Auckland. Tomorrow, the same areas will have a cloudy day with scattered rain, also cloudy over the lower half of the island. Imagine a line from South Taranaki across to Hawks Bay, and it's cloudy for all below it. So midweek in the north looks cloudy with periods of rain and nor'esterlies. It's warm, though, 24 expected for Kaitaya and also Auckland. Cloudy here too, with periods of rain. Noreasterly wins also quite fresh after lunch after luncheon for Tauranga with a high of 22. Hawks Bay in Gisbon will be cloudy at times in the morning. That cloud spreads south in the afternoon with showers around lunchtime in Gisbon, nor easterle is developing for all. And a cloudy morning for most remaining centres with the on shower around the middle of the day for Taumirnui and then spreading to New Plymouth in the afternoon. Crossing Temoana, Orokawa, Cook, Strait and as mentioned earlier, the rain will ramp up in the morning with heavy falls across the day. Thunderstorms are possible in Westport tomorrow night with north to north-east winds for all. Over the divide, and it's partly cloudy tomorrow morning, especially in Blenheim, where rain arrives in the afternoon. High cloud thickens for all after lunch. And those fronts deliver more rain for the bottom half of the South Island. Rain arrives from late morning with the Oamaru, the only town to skip the wet, just cloudy for you. Right to the cities, Autipote-Diniden will wait to cloud. Then that turns to scattered rain from late in the a.m and lingers for the afternoon with North Easterlies, warm though, 24 the high in Mosgiel. Fine for Othotahe-Tahrirch with increasing high cloud, the northeasterly develops across the day two, with 22 the high in the central city. A mild night for Tefanganui-Atero-Wallington, which leads into a mild Wednesday, cloudy at times though, with fresh northerlies by dinner time. A warm day for Te-Mathawa-Mauai Hawks Bay, just a few clouds around. Nor-Easterly winds too, and feeling like 25 in Ahurri, Napier. Wets in Tauranga, with occasional rain tonight and periods of rain tomorrow. Wind-wise, expect a fresh northeasterly in the afternoon with a high of 22. Cloudy with showers both morning and afternoon for Keri-Kerowa Hamilton. Nor-easterlies with a mile 23 degrees for the entire Waikato region. And thunderstorms possible tonight north of the Waitamata Harbour. Tomorrow though no thunderstorms, but cloudy with periods of rain and fresh nor-easterlies. Now showers are expected for Aussie's southeastern cities. Elsewhere it's looking dry and mostly sunny, with Brisbane looking to be the better holiday spot. And rain affects the Central Pacific Island nations with thunderstorms for Fiji. Rain and strong south easterlies for the southern cooks with large swells too. Now back home and I'm sorry parents, the school holidays remain wet for the northern regions till early afternoon on Friday but Saturday looks fine. Not much better here either. With heavy falls full Bay of Plenty Thursday and Friday Saturday will be cloudy for Gisbon and Hawks Bay with isolated showers. Heavy rain on Thursday in the West and lingering through Friday too but it's looking good for Saturday just a little chilly to start. It's much the same here with a wet and bleak couple of days ahead. Before it clears, also cools, though, on Saturday. And same same for the lower half of the south, the exception of Southland that will have isolated showers on Saturday. So not a great forecast for the school holidays, but it does look to improve just in time for the next long weekend. I look forward to that. That's News Hub Live at 6 for today.
