See you later on one. You love the feeling of the outdoors on those warm summer nights? Can't wait to get out and do those fun-filled activities? Introducing the TiVo Instant Indoor Outdoor heater. It's designed to be the fastest, warmest heater you'll ever ride. Standard outdoor heaters can take forever to warm up and could cost you a fortune in gas, but not the TiVo heater. The secret is the TiVo heater's carbon fiber bulb technology. It produces radiant heat rays that heat you directly, and you won't believe the cost savings. This standard outdoor gas heater costs around $3.50 per hour to run. But the energy efficient TiVo Instant Indoor Outdoor heater, with its built-in motion sensors, only costs around 40 cents per hour to run. That's a saving of around $3.10 per hour. And it never runs out of gas at the wrong time. Plus, it's 100% weatherproof. So it's not affected by rain or wind. In a standardized wind test with a 15 km an hour breeze, the TiVo heater measures a full 10 degrees warmer than the outdoor gas heater, even in real life conditions. When it gets really cold, you can take it indoors to create summer in your bedroom or your bathroom. TiVo heater is an affordable and efficient way to heat your entire home, with its built-in motion sensors that automatically shut off when you leave one room and turn on when you enter another. Similar Italian design heaters are expensive, but here today, you won't pay anything like that.
