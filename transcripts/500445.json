Certainly we have a massive day ahead of us and I want to encourage you to make sure you get plenty of liquids in you. There's teas and coffees and not too long the Delongy stand will be open for some real coffee. So just a few housekeeping matters for you. Please make a note of the emergency exits. Should an emergency occur, the operation staff will assist us. If you're looking for the restrooms, if you head directly outside these doors and head up one flight of stairs, they'll be located there. I'll also be keeping an eye on the Twitter feed, so if you want to post any questions through Twitter, be sure to use the hashtag HASH-NZMS. We'll also have a roaming mic at the end of the presentation from UMang and we'll take some questions there. It now gives me a great pleasure to introduce our networking breakfast speaker, Umang. So after recently leaving his position as director of social strategy for Walmart. At Walmart, Umong was responsible for leveraging social technologies to help protect, manage and improve the company's reputation. Umon focused on a daughter-driven approach to developing those strategies. Prior to this, he led the social media efforts for Microsoft with their smaller medium businesses. He also has a diverse technology-driven background and marketing career, including launching a digital and customer marketing programs for zero B.A systems and VMware. And he's also founded a company called Cube Consulting, which provides integrated marketing services to startups and emerging businesses. This morning, Umang will be talking to us about modern marketing, the pursuit of ignorance. So please join me in welcoming Umang to the stage this morning. Thank you. Thanks a lot. All right. Thank you all for having me. I told Kevin when I got here this morning that I've changed the presentation that I was originally going to give. Whenever I was at Microsoft or Walmart, I would give a specific talk about the work I was doing there. Sometimes it'd get really specific about social media or data. I want to take this opportunity to sum a lot of that up. So a lot of times you get speakers that'll come on stage. They might be professional speakers. That's all they do is just go out and speak. I speak a fair bit, but I'm also a practitioner. So I want to explain why I'm saying the things I'm saying. And I'm going to tell you a little story. It's my story. It's about a lot of what Kevin just introduced. But hopefully I'm going to leave you guys with some key tips that I focus on and all the work that I do. So who am I? So my name is Umung. I'm a geek. I have an IT degree. I started out really technical. I was working in server rooms. I was really hardcore technical. And but at the heart of it, I like to solve problems. It's what I do. It's what I love to do. When I was a kid, I would break things apart and try to put them back together. It's usually actually pretty bad at putting them back together, but I was good at taking them apart, learning about them. And things really haven't changed that much. For companies, what I do is I solve problems. I solve big problems for big companies. So here are a few of the companies over the past 10 years that I've worked for. And why I take this approach is just because I like answers. I like answers a lot. So for my friends and families, they hate that because I always have to be right. But for the companies, it's great because I like being right. But I will tell you that I'm here today with more questions than when I started 10 years ago. And I think that's a great thing. And I hope that you guys kind of have the ambition to do the same thing. So I started my career, my marketing career, at a company called Xerox. Actually, most of you probably know Xerox is this tagline, the document company. So 10 years ago, I started in sales with them, but I was kind of different. Xerox was known for creating really world-class salespeople. They had this amazing training, and it was a competitive program to get in. But I was a little bit different. I wasn't just a sales guy. Like I said, I was a geek. So I approached things really differently. In every sales engagement I had, I would ask the question, how does technology help this situation? What can I do with technology to solve this problem? I would ask that of my clients. I would ask that of my company. I had one example I used to sell to schools and public sector. So I'd found out that internally within Syrac, they have a bunch of research centers, and they come up with all these cool new technologies. They had this technology 10 years ago that would go out and just scan your whole network and tell you every device that was on there and what kind it was and how much it cost you to print something. So I took that, and no one else, none of my peers knew about that. I took that, kind of shared it with the the school administrator who one had no idea all the devices that was on you know his network but ultimately kind of explained how working with Xerox could help make his business or his school more efficient this is the new Xerox some of you guys might not know this but this is a company that understands that innovation and reinvention really matter, and this is where my marketing career started. So from the beginning, it's been really apparent to me that technology can solve problems. It's not the solution though. This is kind of the rubbed. So over the 10 years, I love technology. I live and breathe it, but a lot of people will end up having kind of an over-dependence on technology. It's not the solution, but it helps solve problems. So from there, I was wooed out to Silicon Valley, worked for a bunch of early stage companies, some startups. One of them was called VMware. Does anyone here know what VMware does? Like three, four, five hands. It doesn't surprise me. VMware is one of these companies. They were supposed to be the hottest IPO after Google. Google just taken off is skyrocketed. They were supposed to be the next big thing. EMC bought them, spun them back out. Well, see, startups have this issue. A lot of times that they deal with. They make really good products. And they focus on the product. They focus on their engineers. And when you're going through an IPO, you now have shareholders to answer to. So a lot of times, that's not enough. So my job at VMware was to help them appreciate and understand what the customer experience was like. Give you an example, it's on this internal consulting team. We'd go and work with the different teams across the company to just to be a part of it and can be the voice of the customer. We're updating the telephone tree system. You know, whenever you call into a company, you have all these options. Well, the IT team actually led that. And they had this perfectly laid out telephone tree of what what options were the best and the fastest the smoothest way to build this tree it just it made sense on paper and I just asked a simple question well what's the most popular option oh well that's support where is that on the list oh it's four because it just so it made sense on the plan. It made sense for support to be the fourth. But if you're a consumer, you're a customer calling in for support, last thing you want to do is listen to five different options before you get to the one that you're most likely going to pick. Simple things like this, but when you're a startup, you don't necessarily think about that. So I learned that customer experience matters. Kind of knew it, but you don't have to be a startup to appreciate that challenge between products, an internal focus versus an external focus. So then I spent a little bit of time consulting, mentioned Q'd consulting. By all objective measures was an overwhelming failure I learned a ton but just was not a great business per se I got a call though and as a geek I got a call from a legend like this is the stuff that people dream about Bill didn't actually call me directly it was Microsoft. And how many people here have heard of Microsoft? Yeah? A few? A couple? Okay, good. So having had some of the startup experience, I worked with Microsoft. My job there was to help our partners sell and market our products. So everyone here is touched by Microsoft Technologies every day. We don't realize that a lot of the technologies that you touch, you don't even know, because some partner has added to it, they've customized it. What I worked with them on was how do they leverage newer technologies to help them do their job? Cool technologies at the time that were like really cool, like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, you know, things that were actually new. And they use those tools to help connect with customers. They use those tools to help sell technologies, understand what you all needed and make a technology that was better for you. So I don't know. I don't know if this analogy resonates. you all needed and make a technology that was better for you. So I don't know, I don't know if this analogy resonates. I say this every once in a while. People refer to Microsoft in large companies as kind of like an evil empire. So, well, some people think of it that way. I actually think of Microsoft as a company that embraces innovation, new technologies. I mentioned earlier, I was just flown in from Barcelona yesterday. I was at a Microsoft conference event out there. And they were sharing with us all of the latest wearable technology. They know and are working with every startup and they know what every new wearable technology is. They're trying to understand it. They're trying to figure it out. They're not going to get involved in everyone. But that's the key is kind of it's our job to know about this stuff. But it's okay if we end up not using a technology. And it's okay if even if it's the coolest, newest thing, that if it just doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. Then something really interesting happened. Got another call, another evil empire called me. But this was special. This was a different kind of call. You guys probably, you guys have heard of Walmart. You know it's a big company. I remember, I think it was my second call with them. They basically were presenting the opportunity to work at a Fortune 1 company. I'm going to pause for a second because it took me a second, and I was expecting them to say Fortune 100, no, Fortune 1. Biggest company in the world, right? Who might have criticized success? They wanted me to help them protect, manage, and improve their reputation through digital. You know, easy job. I don't like to back down from challenge, so I accept it. This also, I don't know if it transfers. I don't know if you guys know who Paul Harvey is, but anyways. So my job was really about helping Walmart tell their story. It was the rest of the story. It was a story that only Walmart could tell, that wasn't always convenient, but it was important to tell. Stories like how Walmart committed $2 billion to fight hunger. It was like how Walmart committed to hiring every honorably discharged veteran that wanted a job, that would give them a job. Just countless stories about how their tagline lived out, how they helped families save money so they could live better. I remember these stories were kind of interesting because not everyone wanted to hear these stories. And I think that in a way, in a weird way, I'm going to contradict myself in something I say later, but in a weird way, that was kind of great. Because we had forces that worked against us really hard. They didn't want us to tell this story because this is an inconvenient story. I remember over the holidays one year, we did a thunder clap you guys know what a thunder clap is thunder clap is where you basically get a group of people to all join together and send a unified message at the same time at some point in the future And it was around kind of you know it was around letting our associates talk about how happy they were to work at the company. And really, people that worked there love working at this company. I had death threats. I had people online, like calling me some of the worst things I've ever been called. And it was online, so I guess that's okay, right? It was on Twitter, so that's all fine. Things that they would never say in real life. But what that taught me, though, was that it was provocative right we got a reaction it was something that they didn't want to hear it's not it's not an easy thing to do but it's incredibly rewarding so what I learned at Walmart was that having a story really matters but knowing how to tell that story just matters so much more. So it brings me to today. A few months ago, I was presented with a unique, challenging, kind of an amazing opportunity. I was asked to help redefine a house of iconic brands. Brands that you all know, brands that you love, at a 150-year-old company. That's not easy, right? Doing anything for 150 years is not easy. This is a company that went from being a soup company. If I had my badge, it said Campbell's Soup. That's who we are. But today, we're a global food company. You guys know Arnitz. You guys know, you have bowl towels, peppers. We have a ton of these great, amazing brands. So my job was to redefine how a CPG looks at marketing. But it all starts with a purpose. So, this is our purpose. We make real food that matters for life's moments. It is new for us internally, but it's actually the way that the company has been built over 150 years organically. But I think what really my job is today is to how do I use digital marketing to help bring this purpose to life? How do we change from a traditional advertising company on a model to a modern marketing approach, a way of life? How do you have a conversation that's meaningful? These are all hard things for brands to do online, but I like things that are difficult. I like challenges. How do we grow these iconic brands that are 150 years old, but still keep them relevant? I have a plan for all that. I'm only a few months in, so I wish I could give you my big key takeaway for here. But, you know, I have lots of great ideas on, and over an espresso or a drink or something, happy to give you any of those. But I also have a plan for how we quantify it. This has been a bit elusive in our field. It's how do we measure success? And it's not the old ways. It's not the likes, the clicks. That's not enough. That's not valuable enough. So I have a plan for that. But what I'm learning today now is that being a purpose-driven company does matter. Doing things for the right reason matters. I'll probably do a lot of things wrong. Hopefully I'll do more things right. But like I said, offline, happy to talk to you guys more about kind of what I'm doing. So, after 10 years in this space, I have this ever-evolving list. Every new opportunity, I kind of come at it with a few key things in mind. I'm going to share with you guys kind of what I focus on and hopefully leave you today with kind of what I've learned that I actually still don't know. Think about these things for yourself. You know, they apply to everyone, whether you work for yourself, hopefully at a successful consulting company for yourself, or for a Fortune One company, completely relevant. So, seek risk, feel discomfort, and fail really quickly. This is not something you do. This is a way of thinking and being. It's really easy to do the same campaign you did last year and just tweak it. That's easy. Anyone can do that because you've already done it. Unfortunately, the world we live in, it doesn't value playing it safe. If you don't feel uncomfortable, then you're just playing it too safe. And I say this all the time, every job. Like, if no one around the room feels even slightly uncomfortable, you haven't pushed hard enough. So seek risk, feel discomfort, and fail quickly. Don't be reckless. You know, use some judgment in there. And I can't tell you what reckless is because it's different for you and it's different for me and it's different for the brand that you might work for. Your audience can tell you a lot. It can help you define what reckless is. So understand your audience. Audience above everything. Don't start with the tactics. Start with your audience. Understand them. Get to know what they want. Get to know what they don't want. Understand what they do and not just what they say. It's all like really seemingly very basic things, but actually pretty hard to do. How do you do that? Focus on data. This was actually going to be my talk, because this is what I was going around at Walmart talking about, is data-driven social strategy. Data has a place in every aspect of our digital marketing strategies. We've never had access to the kinds of data we have today. Never. And next week and month and year, we're going to have even more. We have interest data, we have activity data, purchase data. The key is to use data for decision-making and not reporting. So many times we just pump out these dashboards and people look at numbers and they say, okay, great, we're on track. That's not enough. We need to look at every source of data that we can find that helps us make a decision faster. More and more of this is available to us today than ever. It's amazing. There's just no excuse anymore. There's been a theme. Obviously, technology and innovation throughout this makes sense being at the conference we're at. Technology and innovation really matter. They're critical. That's why we're here today. But they're not the most important thing ever. Technology is never the most important thing. Don't focus on that. Don't focus on advertising. Don't focus on media. Focus on your customer. Focus on using technology to help you do something better. Because in of itself, it does nothing for you. And when you focus on delivering value through storytelling and use technology as a way to help you connect with a group that you couldn't connect with or you connect with an individual in a way that's more meaningful, that's the right use of technology. And there's this term, this is this first time I'm presenting this concept, it this term I've been kicking around this idea of pure marketing so many things change in our space just obvious every day there's something new there's a new way of doing things but some things don't change that's marketing right this is this is kind of this is pure have a story know what makes you different and just own it. If you don't know what makes you different, that's a whole mother problem. You need to figure that out. Because if you don't have a unique value problem, this applies when I talk to people that are looking for career advice, when I talk to startups that are looking to get into a company, the same individuals. I have a story. You have a story. You need to have a story. You need to know what makes you different. And you need to be able to convey that story to people. It's really important to be interesting and memorable. But I mentioned before, it's more important to be provocative. If you say something, everyone's like, okay, good. It's useless. You want a reaction. Even if the reaction is, okay, good. It's useless. You want a reaction. Even if the reaction is, I hate you, it's a perfectly fine reaction. If they say, yeah, I love you, it's even better. But be provocative. And tell a story that your audience cares about. Not one that you care about. A lot of these big companies that I've worked for, look, there are so many times where we think it's a great idea to tell this story. You know, they'll push out a press release, they'll post a blog post, they'll send it off on Twitter. No one cares. They're thinking that it's really important because in their world, in their lens, it is. But for your audience, it isn't. So be comfortable with saying, we care about this, but no one else does. That's okay. Share it internally. Let everybody internally celebrate it. You don't have to tell the world because putting out bad content or mediocre content, unprovocative content is worse than putting out bad content or mediocre content, unprovocative content, is worse than putting out no content. And all of this, pure marketing, all of this, follows a simple formula. It's like the heart of it. This formula in one way, shape, or form has been in all of my presentations for the past five years. You take a compelling story, compelling, right? That word is really meaningful. Compels action. Take a compelling story, deliver it to an engaged audience anywhere, everywhere that's relevant to them. It's really that simple. It's not easy. It's not easy, but it really is that simple. So after 10 years of learning, failing, and hopefully succeeding somewhere along the way, I know what I don't know. I know that I'm never going to know everything. I know the more that I learn, the more I don't know. I know that I'm never going to know everything. I know the more that I learn, the more I don't know. I also know there's someone out there that knows more than me. It's true for everybody. It's hard for me to say. I'm not very humble. But that I know. So in closing, I want to leave you guys with a quote and a challenge. This quote sums up the journey that we're all on. We should all be on. And if you're not on this journey, I would argue that you're on the wrong path. I'm going to read it. One good question can give rise to several layers of answers. It can inspire decades-long searches for solutions, can generate whole new fields of inquiry, and can prompt changes in the entrenched thinking. This is what we all should be doing. This is what technology can help us do. We have questions. Technology and data can help us answer those questions. We should ask more questions, ask harder questions. Technology and data can help us answer those questions. We should ask more questions, ask harder questions. So this is the networking brunch, breakfast thing. I was told that Kiwis don't actually start this early, so I'm very happy to see everybody here. So my challenge to you, as I see you around the the conference as I see you today at any point I'd love to hear your story especially if it's about something that you don't know and since we are at a networking breakfast type thing tell your tell whoever's next to you a good story about something you don't know as well all right thank you for having me. Thanks so much for that. So we're going to have some roaming mics. Again, if you want to fire some questions through Twitter, feel free to do that, but please do wait for the roaming mic and be sure to introduce yourself. So I'll just kick this off while the roaming mics are getting ready. You gave us an example. Well, you talked about your first point around seek, risk, fail fast. I was wondering whether you could give us an example and some of the lessons from one of your times you really took a big risk. Yeah, so I, there's a lot. I'm trying to think the one that kind of comes to mind is at Walmart. So when I joined Walmart, you know, I joined, again, focused on social strategy. It was trying to help them tell their story and kind of around topics they hadn't told before. And this was, this was kind of in a stage where we were with social, with technology, people were really consolidating. There were lots of new things out there. They needed to get a handle of them. And so what I did was I actually said, look, I don't think we actually need fewer properties. I think we need more. And it was just kind of counterintuitive to the way that most people were doing things. They were trying to get everything into one channel or using just one handle. And I said, no, we need, we're telling these stories that are really kind of deep. They're tough, they're involved stories. So we need these communities. So we spun up six times as many communities we had before. And it was against all of our better judgment. We ended up, you know, we did end up failing in a way that we, some of the communities didn't, they didn't work. They weren't the right communities. But at the end we did end up with six times as many communities and channels than we had before. But we also, once we figured out that right formula, we found engagement grew, advocacy grew. It was exactly the right thing because when you try to have these really deep, meaningful conversations in one space about different topics, it just doesn't work. So did you find it challenging getting the buy-in from the executive team? Yeah, no, it was tough because a lot of times these programs are measured. I talked about quantifying it, they're measured on community size. They're measured on how many people are in that community, how many likes do you have. That stuff doesn't always matter, because when you're talking about something like fighting hunger, you might not have that conversation with 10 million people. It might be OK to have that conversation with 10,000 people that really care, that are engaged, that are influencers, and that are sharing your content out on your behalf, that are engaged, that are influencers and that are sharing your content out on your behalf, that's super valuable. But the metrics that people were used to measuring success by were all about quantity and not quality. You're fair enough. So going now to the audience, any questions? If you just stick your hand up, our team will get to you. There's just a question there. Hi, I'm just curious to know, so you were working with brands at head office level. So these companies are international, but you are at head office. The problem that I'm seeing in New Zealand is with international brands, the head offices are not New Zealand. So what's happening is marketers are basically in the shadow of Australia, certainly in the shadow of the global brand, and they don't have a lot of flexibility with fixing some inherently big problems, such as branding or telling a story. So what are your suggestions for New Zealand marketers who are working in big brands but don't really have the control to do a rebrand or change the story? Yeah. No, it's a good point. And so I'll kind of address it on two points. I working at our head office and we have a New Zealand office, we have an Australia office, so my job is to kind of help set that structure and that tone, so all of our different groups are able to kind of follow a similar game plan. When you're on the other side, though, I think one of the most important things is to be willing to challenge and to be willing to say, this doesn't work. Just fundamentally saying that, hey, this creative isn't good. Or this doesn't tell our story. This is a story we want to tell, not that our audience wants to tell. And using data to help quantify what it is that your audience wants. I mean, it's hard to argue with that. It's hard to argue with data. So I think a lot of times what ends up happening at these companies is you get a lot of just momentum. This is the way things have been done. But a company that's been operating for 150 years, you can imagine there are some ways that things are done. And coming in and just saying, asking the question of why and maybe challenging a little bit really forces everyone else to answer the question why. So I would just say, ask and challenge. I think you're going to see. And if you have the data, if you can pull the data out and present it back, it's really hard to argue with that. Any other questions at this stage? I'll throw another one out at you. You talked about, I love the point, data for decision making, not for reporting. So over the years, what have been some of the, I guess, coming out to where you are with Campbell's, what are some of the key data metrics that you're focusing on? Yeah. So there's this concept, and I'm actually literally in the midst. I've had my whole wall painted as a whiteboard, because I like to draw, and I like to get up and just scribble stuff out. There's this whole idea of momentum that I'm trying to quantify. So what I love about this conference, and when I looked at the mission was around, it's not just about one channel. It's about all of these different channels and using them together. And so there's this measure that I'm trying to put together, this algorithm around momentum. Where are people coming from and where are they going to? Because if you can get people to move across channels, like that shows a level of commitment and investment that's way more than hitting like within Facebook. So there's this idea of momentum and moving people through channels and across channels, having them come in at different points. It's the movement that matters. It's not just the engagement within one channel. having them come in at different points, it's the movement that matters. It's not just the engagement within one channel. None of our lives, none of us live in one channel. So that's great if you get a bunch of likes on Facebook. What does that mean? But certainly there's obviously an increasing pressure on us as marketers to monetize our digital and social media efforts. And obviously they show that return on investment. So what's your view being on this? Look, yeah, at the end of the day, we're in business to make money. And even if we're not in the business to make money, even if you're out of a not-for-profit, you have to be able to justify your existence, your team's existence, your investments. I actually believe that if we are able to measure momentum and movement, will actually, my goal is to be able to tie that back to revenue impact in some way, shape, or form. It is important. As much as I would love to say that, you know, that's not the only thing that's important. We need to come up with a way to quantify the time we put in, the effort we put in. It's not necessarily going to be the most important thing. There is, there's a whole, I have this social investment continuum where I think the, I think the most important thing we can get even beyond a purchase sometimes is advocacy If I can get somebody else out there saying how great I am and I just sit there and shut up Like that's better than somebody buying a can of soup That's my argument So how do you take your executive through that journey then? Yeah, so part of it is, you know, being able to show what that, what investing in kind of a multi-channel approach, what that looks like. What does advocacy look like and why does it matter? Examples help a lot, right? Other people, if you have some internal successes, awesome. Even if they're small. It's an example of, hey, look, we only put this much effort into creating this content, which other people then went out and shared with a positive connotation. We reached all these people with this little investment. It could be a really small, like, even have very minimal. I can have no paid component to it. It can just be we spent an hour creating this, and this is what it resulted in. I think examples do matter. Where you don't have them, there are tons of these great campaigns out there that you can use, and it doesn't even have to be in your industry. This is another thing. At the end of the day, we're all people. We all kind of operate in a similar way. So being able to talk about how different audiences engage with content and the value of advocacy and the value of those different measures, even if it's in a different industry, I think just bringing in examples can help justify increase in investment for what we do. Excellent. Back to the floor. Any questions? Well, I'll be around for the next day. I'll be around all day today, so thank you again for having me. Excellent. Well, please join me and thank you to me. All right. Thanks so much. Well, there we are. First session of you. Please join me and thank you to me. All right. Thanks so much. Well, there we are.

What I'd like to actually ask you guys to do is if we can head through to the exhibition area, we're just going to reset the room, get the room ready for the opening keynote this morning. So if you can also take your belongings with you, just as we look to reset, and then we'll be back in the room around 20 to 9."}
