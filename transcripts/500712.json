Freedoms, masks, meeting up, how this new phase of the Omicron battle changes things. A move to combat the soaring cost of living. The official cash rate jumps up in an effort to bring prices down. And the dinosaur that's bad to the bone. And a fossil thirst, one of the world's most terrifying predators arrives in Auckland. Discover the T-Rex in a fossil thirst. One of the world's most terrifying predators arrives in Auckland. Discover the T-Rex and a kit set. Kiyoda, good evening. Get those dancing shoes ready. In just under six hours, you'll be able to rock the dance floor at bars and clubs as New Zealand finally moves to the orange traffic light setting. Let's lay it out. The entire country shifts from red to orange at 11.59 p.m. tonight, not the usual 48-hour wait for change. The health minister calling today's overall picture of the Omicron outbreak a very positive one. Mask use is still necessary in close quarter businesses like retail stores, supermarkets and hairdresses, and on public transport. Masks are not required in schools, but are encouraged. There are no indoor or outdoor gathering limits, and the seating rules are gone too. The level setting will be reviewed again in mid-May. With what today's loosening of the COVID ties mean for you, here's senior political reporter Benedict Collins. From showdowns to stand up. People looking like they never saw a car before. Just two of the shows due to hit our shores in the coming months. Will, we'll. Our move to Orange now makes them possible. It'll bring the buzz back to the city and those accommodation and hospitality outlets that have been really quiet for a long time will really enjoy the benefit of those events. Most people we spoke to were hiding too. I am really quiet for a long time, we'll really enjoy the benefit of those events. Most people we spoke to were hiding too. I am really excited for the concerts. I really want to go to them. I'm going to go see a snow dog, yeah. Yeah, it'll be nice to go places with lots of people. I don't feel like it matters at all. The government's rationale, we're over the peak. And we're now well on the other side of it. In some places the cases are falling off quickly. And others they're plateauing, but the overall picture is a very positive one. But he got in quite a muddle over when masks are still mandatory. We continue to encourage the use of face masks when people are out and about in public, including on flights, retail, public transport and in public facilities like libraries. Was he sure they're not still compulsory? I'll come back to it in a few moments just on mask use and on flights in particular. Oops. My apologies for that, yes, you still do need to wear a mask in a retail setting. Sorry, just give me one minute. I've just got masks are still a requirement on public transport, so including flights. But where masks are no longer mandatory is in schools, and that's controversial. Masks are a central layer of protection enclosed and enclosed spaces. We know that children, there's many occupants in the room, as many layers as we can provide. The move to Orange getting a mixed reaction at Parliament? There's a massive relief for people in the hospitality and events industry. We've just passed 500 deaths in this country, which two years ago would have been completely unacceptable. So it does feel like a strange time to be stepping down. Some find it strange that now Kiwis will be able to party maskless and nightclubs, but still have to wear one while food shopping. There are going to be a lot more people in the supermarket on a weekly basis than there will be out and about passing on a dance floor. The only person I'll be patching on the weekends, my very pregnant wife. Thanks. That's too much information, Mr Bishop. Yes indeed, Anne Benedict joins us now live from Wellington. Was the mover surprise, Benedict? Yeah, good evening, no, I don't think it was a huge surprise. The government is increasingly confident that we're over the worst of this. They say that case numbers are trending down and that the number of people in hospital, you know, we're able to cope with. They also suspect that a huge number of New Zealanders have already had the virus. Maybe around 2 million New Zealanders have already had COVID. So they're taking that into account as well. You know, on the other hand, though, the pediatrician that we spoke to there in the story, she would have liked to see New Zealand remain at alert level red for a lot longer. She says, well, when we may be over the peak, there's a long, long way to go down. E to Fang Nua Atara in Wellington, Benedict Collins, thanks. Well, skyrocketing inflation has pushed the Reserve Bank to lift the official cash rate to 1.5%. That's up 50 basis points, the biggest single jump in over 20 years. And it comes as the crisis at the checkout continues. Fruit and veggies are up 18% in the last year alone. The annual increase in food prices is now the highest it's been in a decade, with an average rise of 7.6% over the past 12 months. Meat, poultry and fish prices, though, have increased 8.7%. Katie Bradford takes a look at how today's big move by the Reserve Bank will affect you and the cost of living. The 1970s were exciting, changing times. But it was also a time of high inflation. The most important economic problem facing the country. And now history is repeating itself. If we manage it right, it's likely that the inflation rate will come down. Now that still means that people will have experienced the high prices and a cousin their incomes. Those soaring fruit and veggie prices hitting people where it hurts. She's about to buy lunch and that's really going to cost me a lot more than I'd like. My friend and I co-own a car and so that's like, again, amazing that we couldn't share that cost because I definitely couldn't do it alone. A key part of the Reserve Bank's job is to keep inflation under control. Instead, it's rampant, out of control, runaway, whatever word you use for it, it's bad. So the Reserve Bank taking the path of least regrets, sending a signal it wants to dampen demands by lifting the official cash rate, its biggest jump in 22 years. The Reserve Bank is concerned that what might happen is this inflation, price shock, may actually go on to ongoing inflation, spiring inflation. And just like the 1970s, the government too is feeling the heat. The government also has fiscal responsibilities to make sure that it's got good fiscal discipline. It's not wasting taxpayers' money and it's not contributing to domestic inflation through being addicted to spending as they are. We're going to continue to make sure we support New Zealanders through what is a really challenging period. That eye-watering 18% rise in the cost of fruit and veggies is well ahead of the general inflation rate of 5.9%. That there's more the supermarkets could do to make fruit and vegetables and other food affordable. As interest rates go up, house prices fall. Perhaps a tiny glimmer of hope for those under 40 known as Generation Rent. Only 40% of them are in houses as they own. With rising interest rates, wage stagnation, huge run on house prices, this is feeding into anxiety. But for people who feel like this, I'd basically just resign myself with the fact that I'm going to move to Australia. Clear-headed decisions becomes really important. Some advice in tough global economic times. And Katie's with us now live. In historical terms, Katie, this was a big jump today. Why so big? Kiota, yes, as I said, they're the biggest in 22 years. There was no doubt that the Reserve Bank would lift the OCR today. The question really was, how big would they go? And they went big. Now, it really sends a strong signal that they are serious about tackling inflation. They're trying to get ahead of it as it runs away and trying to reduce demand there. But we can expect to see further lifts over this year. Look, the global uncertainty will continue. We're seeing this around the world. The one tool that the Reserve Bank has in its kit to fight it is to keep lifting the official cash rate. And with their six weekly announcements they have now, you can probably expect to see that for the next few months at least. And the OCR affects things like mortgages and savings. Any reaction from the banks yet? Well, the banks have been pricing this in. If you hold a mortgage, you've probably noticed that those rates have been climbing quite steadily. Today, though, already we saw banks BNZ and A&Z have already lifted their mortgage rates as well. But some good news if you're a saver, if you're trying to squirrel some money away, the rates on saving and term deposit accounts are lifting too. Now, look, when it comes to the housing market, we are starting to see some falls there. The Reserve Bank says it's starting to return to what it calls a sustainable level of growth. And when it comes to inflation, look, next Thursday, we will see the next figures on that. The Reserve Bank predicting it to be about 7%. Many economists predicting it to be higher. So the pain on that will continue for some time yet. In our Auckland newsroom, Katie Bradford, Ten, Aque. Communities have been cut off on the North Island's east coast as the regions battered by an ex-tropical cyclone. Gisbon and the East Cape are taking the brunt of the deluge just weeks after another big storm swept through the area. Kristen Hall reports. The beachside settlement of Waipero Bay is already isolated, but with this road washed out, some residents are now completely cut off. I think everyone sort of got themselves sorted yesterday, knowing that this was coming, and they parked their vehicles on this side of the road. A storm just three weeks ago caused thousands of dollars of damage to Paki Duce's property. He's now wondering how much longer his Fano will be able to live so close to the water. Can't sustain this too much longer. Financially, it's cost us quite a bit of money and yet to do here. We love the place. This is what you get in when it has a bad day. But on a good day, you couldn't ask for the better place in the world to be here. Down the coast, Tokomaru bays drenched again too. Jinnah Chaffi O'Pourri came to check in on her elderly mother, but now can't get out. I think the fridge needs to go up or it needs to be cleared regularly. It's been a treacherous day on State Highway 35, with chunks of the road now closed to flooding and severe wind in Tolliger Bay nearly pushed the waves backwards. The effects of this storm could have been more widespread. Early forecasts put most of the North Island in the firing line, but it's just Tide Afti that's borne the brunt as the storm tracked further east. When the wind does not come from the west, when it comes from the east or northeast, that's when they get their big dumps of rain. And recently, for the past several months, we've had this thing called La Nina. And we can get used to plenty more weather events like this. What climate change does, it does three things. It makes them more likely. It makes them more extreme. And it makes them more frequent. Local authorities warning it's not over yet in Gisbon. Sewage is now being pumped into the river as the wastewater system struggles to cope. We've been working really hard with property owners to try and address that issue. But when you're dealt with this kind of weather, there's no other option for us but to do that. This battered region now facing another lengthy cleanup. And Kristen's with us now live from Gisbon. Kiyo-ra, Kristen, what's the forecast like? More wet weather to come? Kiyo-da, Simon. Yes, unfortunately, this truly awful weather is set to continue for several more hours. Yeah, it's been absolutely relentless since about 7 o'clock this morning. 180 millimetres of rain has fallen in the East Cape just since midnight and 27 millimeters in just one hour. A fairly extraordinary number, Met Service tells me. In Gisbon, the heavy rain warning is set to last until 1 o'clock this morning. In Wairoa, it's set to last through until 4 a.m. And we've seen some very strong winds today as well that are expected to continue here in Gisbon until 5am tomorrow morning. So another unpleasant night ahead for some. Live from Gisbon, a bedraggled Kristen Hall. Thank you very much. And you can keep track of the storm's movement and all the latest developments on our website, onenews.co.n.z, and of course our other digital platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Our border has reopened to vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents who are able to enter Al-Tirroa without isolating. The first flight touched down in Auckland just after midnight with reunions for travellers who now don't have to go through MIQ. Around 3,000 people arrived from Australia today. New York is tonight on high alert and police are on the trail of a man who lobbed smoke grenades before opening fire in a subway station injuring 17 people. A quiet morning commute that turned into a war zone. That's how New York's mayors describe the shocking attack in Brooklyn. Our US correspondent Anna Burns Francis has the latest. As the subway train pulled into the station, commuters began running for their lives. Smoke pouring out from the car, but worse was inside. A gunman and a gas mask had set off a gas canister and opened fire. 36th Street and Fourth Avenue, for multiple people shot with as close as a bike. Panicked, passengers managed to escape the Manhattan-bound train. As they ran, the injured staggered out, laying down on the platform. I saw a lot of people coming out of a train station. One of them was injured. I believe it was a lady getting shot right on her leg. She was screaming. You know, she was in a lot of pain. The gunman got away, police quickly launching a citywide manhunt. Some clues were left behind the gunman's backpack and a rented van in the name of a 62-year-old man, Frank James. The two crime scenes, the subway and the van, are very active and are still being processed. We are asking for anyone's help with information. The rush hour attack occurred at a subway station in Brooklyn, largely home to working class Mexican and Chinese families. I want to begin by assuring the public that there are currently no known explosive devices on our subway trains, and this is not being investigated as an act of terrorism at this time. CCTV at the station was not working. We're grateful for all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians, civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers and try to shield them. But with no word on the motive or man behind the attack, New York is in for a sleepless night. Anna Burns-Franc-Franc, one news.

The discovery of asbestos and Christchurch's water supply has raised concerns it could be an issue around the country. Research shows the substance is leaching from the city's aging pipes. While asbestos might be deadly to inhale, the dangers of ingesting it aren't clear. Ryan Boswell reports. Christchurch's old pipes are being dug up and replaced. They're made with asbestos that's now seeping into the water supply. They are not at levels which present a concern yet to human house. Scientists of sample drinking water carried by asbestos cement pipes dating back to the 1930s. 19 out of 25 fire hydrant sampled had asbestos fibres in the water, so too did 3 out of 15 household taps. There's a few factors that includes sort of the length of pipe the water is exposed to, how old the pipe was. There was concern when asbestos was shaken from buildings in the Canterbury quakes. The naturally occurring mineral can be fatal when it's inhaled, but what if it's ingested in the water? It's a difficult one to say. The World Health Organisation states there's insufficient data available worldwide to derive a health-based link to asbestos in drinking water. We have no sense of how long people may be exposed into what quantities. Christchurch's mayor says work is underway. Over 60% of the pipes that are on our replacement schedule for the next 10 years are actually asbestos cement pipes. It's estimated there's 9,000 kilometres of asbestos piping that need replacing nationwide. The cost $2.2 billion, Nanaya Mahuta, pointing to the government's plan to reform water supply. When you have aged infrastructure, it is evidence to say that there may be some health issues as a result. Meanwhile, the taps are still running even with asbestos. I'm comfortable to drink the water from the pipes, yeah. As pressure grows to clean up our water. Ryan Boswell, One News. Surrounded Ukrainian forces are reportedly running out of ammunition in their last holdouts in the key city of Maripal. Taking it would be a big win for Russia, which the US president has for the first time, now accused of genocide. Kim Baker Wilson with this update. Maripol, scorched, blistered and crumbling. Buildings and Ukrainian fighters are mostly down. What's been called the last battle for this besieged city. If Russian forces take this, the sprawling as of Stal's steel factory, they'll be in full control of Maripol. A wider look at Ukraine shows its strategic significance. For Russia, it completes a land corridor from its border to Crimea, which had seized and occupied in 2014. Russia also gains full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline, cutting its maritime trade and further cutting it from the world. Ukrainians have been fighting for almost 50 days, becoming encircled with no way to get weapons and water, ammunition or food. No way to verify if there was a chemical weapon attack here either. Still a priority probe for Western leaders. You've seen the devastation that Russian airstrikes have wrought on Mariupil in the city. But our assessment is that the Ukrainians are still fighting for it. But so is Putin, Russian-backed troops preparing for an all-out push. In a rare appearance, Putin was at a Russian space launch base, with a warning for the world's west as he eyes Ukraine's east. We take measures to ensure Russia's own security. It's obvious we had no other choice. It's the right decision. We've no doubt goals will be achieved. He says Russia's choosing a time to attack. In Kharkiv, meanwhile, another strike on civilians. And more fires to put out. The civilian death toll in Ukraine is mounting. And for the first time, the U.S. President called it genocide. Yes, I called it genocide. It has become clear and clearer. In Boutcher, the mayor says more than 400 bodies of civilians have been found so far. He's calling it a war crime. Russia calls it a monstrous forgery. Kimbaker Wilson, one news. Meanwhile, New Zealand Defence staff have headed for Europe on a mission delivering military aid for Ukraine. Nine of the 50 personnel deployed were aboard this Hercules aircraft, which left from Funuipai Air Force Base this morning. The two-month deployment is part of the latest support package for Ukraine, including a further $13 million for military, legal and human rights aid. Defense Minister Peeni Hinares says New Zealand personnel will not be entering Ukraine, nor have they been asked to. As the Prime Minister said, right now, there is no intention to have our people in Ukraine, but we'll continue to monitor that as a cabinet and as a government to make the right decision. Zealand's largest deployment to Europe since the 1990s, with this latest package, bringing Al-Tiaro's total contribution to Ukraine to $30 million. The illegal migration season from West Africa to the nearby Canary Islands is in full swing, the Spanish Coast Guard, intercepting wave after wave of boat people. These are the large dinghies migrants were using in their first step to try to reach Europe. Most of those who elude the Coast Guard and safely negotiate the 100-kilometer stretch of water from Africa to the Spanish archipelago, then try to stow away on containers bound from mainland Europe. If caught, they're eventually deported back to Africa. Last year, more than 4,000 migrants were lost at sea trying to reach Spain. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's refusing to step down, despite being one of 50 people fined for breaching lockdown rules. It was a token penalty, $ $94 after the police investigation dubbed Party Gate into a dozen parliamentary gatherings at 10 Downing Street. Johnson's apologized after becoming the first Prime Minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law while in office. And I accept in all sincerity that people had the right to expect better. And now I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people. Johnson tried to explain his breach by saying it occurred during a very long day of engagements on his birthday.

Sex education in schools is getting an overhaul with new information released today for teaching topics like consent, pornography and gender diversity. But as Kate Nicol Williams reports, there's no guarantee all students will have access to the updated health education. Move over Sex Ed, this is a Relationships in Sexuality Class. It actually puts mana onto the relationship part, which is a huge umbrella. The government launching resources for teaching students about healthy relationships after calls for schools to do more about bullying, violence and child abuse. Wellington High has been noted for getting it right, but overall the education's inconsistent. Having a lot of friends that are part of the Rainbow Community, I know that in general there's a lot of misinformation about not just sex but also relationships. There's a young woman, it becomes a lot of misinformation about not just sex, but also relationships. As a young woman, it becomes a very taboo topic, especially around consent, of like, when, like, am I allowed to say no? The education resources are voluntary for schools to use, but whether that will change remains the question. The government says the issue will be addressed when health education is reviewed in two years' time. In Australia, consent education will be mandatory for all students from next year. Our government not yet prepared to take that step. I would hate that we instantly went somewhere and said this has got to be done like this and that we got this wrong. This gives us the opportunity to see this working in action. And views on whether schools should be required to use the resources are split. Schools know their Tamaraki best. They're the ones that are aware of what's going on in their individual contexts. They need to have the right to make decisions themselves. That needs to be at least set to a minimum standard that's enforced across all school boards. Just so that everyone can have a baseline equal opportunity to learn about their rights and their well-being. These students urging school leaders not to underestimate the impact of quality health education. Kate Nicol Williams, One News. The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the first extradition of a New Zealander to China. Kyeong-Yop Kim is accused of murdering Pay Yun Chen while visiting Shanghai in 2009. His lawyers argued against extradition to China due to a risk of torture and an unfair trial. But the court found China's given enough assurances that won't happen. It's a sort of step back 10 or 20 years. It's a very, to my mind, it's a very bad decision in the context of international human rights law. The court has reinstated the previous extradition order by former Justice Minister Amy Adams. We're going to take you to a Jurassic World now to check out a giant from 66 million years ago. And here it comes. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, one of the biggest, meanest and scariest predators ever to roam planet Earth. How big exactly? Well, I'm nearly two meters tall. T-Rex was twice as high at four meters, and that's just up to its hips. When standing tall it could reach a height of more than six meters. Its length stretching just over 12 meters, about the size of a school bus, and it weighed up to eight tons. Getting closer now, but not too close, a huge head here containing the most powerful jaw of any dinosaur. And when he opens up like that, a real mouthful. T-Rex's serrated teeth are both sharp and strong enough to crush bones. The biggest tooth ever found measured 30 centimetres. That's why it's considered the king of dinosaurs and the fiercest carnivore. So what was on the menu? Bad luck for this guy over here, this horned herbivore, the triceratops. Not exactly small itself at up to nine metres, but no match for a hungry T-Rex. And experts believe T-Rexes sometimes even ate each other. You can see evidence of all this yourself when real T-Rex fossils go on display for the first time in New Zealand. Our very excited reporter and big dinosaur fan, Logan Church, was there as the skeleton was unpacked and put together. Peace by piece, crate by crate, bringing the king of the dinosaurs almost back to life. Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing. A T-Rex skeleton on loan from a private collector in Germany. I think it took about two years for the armature and preparation work takes you'd kind of be made. They were the most terrifying predator of the dinosaur world, found mainly in what is now North America. This T-Rex, called Peter, was discovered in Wyoming in 2018. Peter. This T-Rex, called Peter, was discovered in Wyoming in 2018. Peter, the T-Rex, is incredibly unique. He's one of only four black tyrannosaurus skeletons on the globe, black because of the certain type of minerals that formed when the bones were fossilised. The skeleton is 47% complete, one of the most complete ever discovered. Each of Peter's 200 pieces arrived in six large crates earlier this week from Europe. Like all freight across the air freight across the world, there's issues around COVID, and so there's been a few delays over the last couple of weeks. Almost two weeks of work crammed into a few days. Everything had to be pulled out, checked and photographed. Just anything that looks like damage. So, yeah, it's just, we're recording, this is how it arrived. And that's before the team can even think about putting it together. So the hip lock, which is a large kind of piece in the pelvis that you can see, we had to get a mini crane in here this morning to lift it just because of its weight. Pretty much like a assembled by numbers effort like putting together Lego just in a seven-ton format. It's believed Peter may have been killed by another T-Rex, and that's because some of the severe damage found on his leg bones. Only a T-Rex has a jaw powerful enough to make those marks. Auckland Museum is aiming to have Peter the T-Rex ready for the school holidays and will be here until September. There's only about 40 Tyrannosaurus rex specimens on the planet and we have one of them here. Bringing the prehistoric roaring into the 21st century. Logan Church, 1 News. That'll be a tough one for Haley to follow with sport now. Super Rugby Pacific getting a lifeline just when it's needed. Yes, but first of all, Simon, I'm so glad you survived that battle with the dinosaurs. Well done. But back to the competition with interest for the competition waning. The two top teams will face each other on Good Friday. One player in particular hoping to draw in the eyeballs. Can Roger Tuwavashek bring the ratings back from the brink? Pass not content with just saving the ocean. Lechuk and Peter Burling are taking on gender equality as they launched their all-women live ocean racing team. And still some heavy rain and severe gales for the north-east of the country. As the ex-tropical cyclone begins to work its way across the country, check out this hook of cloud here. That is it. And of course, the sting of the tail, As the ex-tropical cyclone begins to work its way across the country, check out this hook of cloud here. That is it. And, of course, the sting of the tail, all the cloud and the rain wrapping around, still affecting parts of Gisbon. But going into Thursday, this whole thing will slowly track away.

Good Friday could be renamed Great Friday or even Relief Friday when it comes to the Super Rugby Pacific competition. The Crusaders host the Blues in a match between the two top New Zealand sides while there's growing concern over interest or lack of it in the competition. Friday's game then has come at exactly the right time, as Andrew Sable reports. A good Friday's Super Showdown with all the ingredients to be a classic. So why not try something different, like halting the dreaded rolling mall? Here they come, over he goes. If the Blues agreed to not do any, would you agree? Maybe a bit of a mall amnesty? Mate, the beauty's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it safe? That's unique, it sets our game apart. A mall amnesty. Look, I look, it's a big part of the game. I have a biased opinion because I think it's an important part of the game. Rolling malls are deregure in 2022, count 15 last week in the Highlanders match alone. It's just one factor being thrown to the pot around interest levels. Since being allowed back, crowds have hardly set the world on fire. Maybe the footy wasn't as good as it needed to be at the start, but I think there's an impression that it's starting to improve. COVID, a constant diet of local derby's players in and out of lineups, theories abound. We've sourced figures which show a major decline in TV audiences. If we go back to World Cup years 2015 and 2019, audiences per game aged 5 and over averaged close to 200,000. Granted, with COVID mangling the competition, that figure dived last year and is now nearly halved from just three years ago. The early rounds of 2022 averaging around 100,000. Streaming and highlights is going through the roof, and that's replaced. People are watching more snack-sized version of the product. The one game that did peak full interest, Roger Tewi Varshek's debut, which almost doubled the ratings numbers. Good Friday then, with an Easter sparkle, has come at a crucial time. Who knows? It could be a return to a packed house and booming numbers of 2004. Oh, Spencer! Oh, this is amazing! That happens to be the last time the Blues won on the mainland. Andrew Saville won news. So he has got very good timing. Can the draw card of Roger Tuay Vasa Shek help rugby's ratings? After months out with a shoulder injury, he's back for the Christchurch matchup, playing off the bench. They might want to push the tacos to one side. Blues and all blacks prop off a tuong of Fasiafasi headed stitches in his head after copping a stray boot in the win over the chiefs. So I think he said 28 in there. It was a back sprig. It's a big head. It's a big head. Back sprig from Sakula, I think. Tuongafasi sporting thegear today at training, and he'll start against the Crusaders. Rugby crowds have been allowed back in for the past few weeks. Now there's good news for sports like netball and basketball. With today's confirmation, we're dropping to Orange. For more on this, let's go live to Trust Stadium in West Auckland and Andrew Saville. Well, Haley, timing is everything in sport, isn't it? And it's perfect timing near on for netball with this slipping down to the orange levels around the country. A huge weekend ahead for the premiership. Three games across the Easter weekend, and Invercargill, Christchurch and Rotorua. And unlimited numbers will be allowed in to watch those netball games. Joining us now live is our Northern Mystics captain, Sulu Fitzpatrick. You're having a pick-up game. And when I say pick-up, it's not really when you're playing against the Northern Stars. But, Suu, what does this mean? What does this news mean to netballers around the country? I think it's really exciting is probably the word. But also we're really grateful that we still actually be able to play games and we're able to do what we love and now we're able to share that with our fans and family who have been there enabling us to be able to do it so we're looking forward to it we're looking forward to having our crowds back our first game on the 24th of April so that'll be nice to have our home team and be running out to our friends and family. You're playing in Invercaro this weekend. You'll get a good crowd there no matter what safe travels to the Deep South. Yes, looking forward to going to the fortress. Thank you. Okay, well, we've seen tonight some hesitancy in rugby crowds returning, and there may be some of that with indoor crowds returning to sports like netball and basketball, but this is a huge relief for those codes with their winter seasons about to begin. Absolutely. Thanks, Sav. And that's Andrew Saville from Trust Stadium. Peter Burling and Blair Chuka laying down an even deeper legacy in sailing. Today launching live ocean racing, another team to their list, but this time it's not them competing. The team's an all-woman crew, footing it against the men. Michelle Prenderall has more. Welcome to a new generation of Kiwi sailing, equal opportunities for women, who also have the need for speed on foiling boats. It's going to be a great year, a great group of people, and I'm stoked to be leading such an awesome team. Liv Mackay, the skipper of the new all-women crew of Joe Alley, Alex Maloney, Molly Meach and Erica Dawson, taking on the ETF series under the banner of Live Ocean Racing. Sound familiar? Live Ocean, the brainchild of Blair Tewk and Peter Burling, champions again, this time, in bridging the gender gap. I'm still a bigger pathway program that needs to happen and hopefully this will inspire younger Kiwi sailors to see that there is a pathway into professional sailing. To say this has been a long time coming would be an understatement. Mackay getting a taste of footing it with the men through Burling and Chuk's NS SALGP team. Erica and I integrating into the team last year was a realisation to, I think, many of the men that why aren't we doing this? Why do we need a special programme? And that's just the skill gap that is there, unfortunately, for women in sailing. And so, P and Blair are really trying to front foot that and take some action. They're literally thrown into the action this weekend for the series start in Europe. Five races across five places, from the port of La Trinite's Humour to Karnak, quivering, Malchesean in Italy, and then the finale in La Rochelle. Right now is just to really focus on upskilling and I really hope show the level that women can get to. Mackay believes that level could be the best in the world. Now she and her Kiwi women have the chance to prove it. Michelle Prenderville, One News. An Irving Durant Clinic has sealed the deal for Kiwi-Shored Marks's Brooklyn Nets booking their place in the Eastern Conference playoffs after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 115-108. The Nets got up by 20 in the first quarter and never lost their lead. There was nothing but Nets, Vicarie Irving, no literally scoring 34 points despite fasting for Ramadan. The game standing fighting. Chance at the last shot. Irving behind the back, trying to get free, does so. And there it is. A perfect half for Kyrie Irving. Nine of nine shooting. What a show in the first half to the former Cav. The Cavs coming within six points on multiple occasions, but Kevin Durant ruined that dream every time, adding 25 points of his own. The nets now face the second-placed Celtics, and that series starting on Monday. The Cavs get one last shot in a sudden-death match-up against either Charlotte or Atlanta on Saturday. They went to the Burnabayu, played one of their best games of the season, beat Real Madrid at home, but Chelsea's defense of their Champions League title is over. Chelsea coming into the second league of their quarterfinal, down 3-1 on aggregate, until they turned on 80 minutes of pure gold. But it's about getting some end product. When you have that sort of possession, you're shifting defenders around. You've got to have a threatening pass at the end of it. Loft is cheap. There's a chance for now to run through. It's a chance. And it's exactly what they need it. Royal Madrid bill. Chelsea won. All pressure on Courtois. They seem to make some mounts again from the Chelsea. Right. There's a hit. It's a good ball by Comichichick. Open there's a header, it's in. It's a good ball by Cobbichick. Open up, Rayl Madrid. Timo Verna, nice and patient. Still, Timo Verna. The Bernou went off, though. We're a pass of absolute footballing genius from Luca Modrich. Set up Rodrigo to make it 4-4 on aggregate. Rale through to the semis after Karim Benzema's extra time strike. By the way, here's a glimpse of how the Burnabay will look as its four-year renovation near completion. One man's mediocre is another's exceptional. World Nović Dockovic returned to the ATP tour in his former hometown of Monte Carlo, only to put on an underwhelming display in his first round loss. Much to the delight of his opponent, a 46th rank Alejandro de Vitovich for Kina. The Spaniard described his 6-3-6761 victory as the best win at his career. Here in Monte Carlo, full people, and against the number one, I enjoy every moment, you know, I'm so happy. Djokovic's mood, meanwhile, was a lot more downbeat. Yeah, I didn't like the way I felt physically in the third. I mean, I just ran out of the gas completely and couldn't really stay in the rally with him. Life isn't so bad for the Serbian. He only has to trot up the hill to his mansion, one of his many international homes, to refuel and take in the view of the Mediterranean. Not a bad view either. It's a great view. Maybe you can get it on Airbnb next time. I think he lives full-time in Marbella now, actually, in Spain. Tough life. Thank you. Thank you very much. Brilliant player, nevertheless.

While it was cloud and rain further north. Down south, it was fine. It was frosty with a bit of fog here. This is Alexandra. Joy Bennett. Thank you very much for this. Starting at freezing, finishing the day at 15, some lovely autumn color. We go back to the weathermaps. Reason why it was fine down south, building high pressure. There's a hook of cloud. We come in close. This lower is sort of bottomed out. It's two more or less at its deepening point. You can see the hook there. We have a quick radar update just to show you 66 millimeters of rain so far for Gisman. You see that darker purple area of red. That's the heavy intense stuff. That's going to slowly shear and then push away over the next few hours. Heavy intense stuff there and the sting and the tail wins. The low will eventually track its way away going through the course of the early hours. All of our watches and mornings, the red ones in particular easing just after midnight, and then look at that. High pressure builds in. The only thing to really point out tomorrow, there'll still be a bit of a gusty old breeze with the leftovers of the ice of ours still close together. A little flick of a front to the far south, but otherwise in good shape, just one or two showers to the far south, maybe the odd one to Kai Taiyah in the morning. Look at that, most of of us in pretty decent shape. You might notice that breeze, just first part of the day across paths of Northland, but it is an improving sort of day. Fine and sunshine for Auckland. Same sort of thing in the morning, those winds, just a bit on the gusty side, but 20 degrees, you've got sunshine, you've got a fine looking day. Head down to Waikato to Hamilton. You've got 20 as well. Great looking day. But of course, just notice that breeze if you're going to beikato to Hamilton. You've got 20 as well. Great looking day. But of course, just notice that breeze if you're going to be out about first thing. They have plenty central plateau, similar sort of thing here. Those gusty winds, but start off the day you're fine. Some cooler single figures here and there. It's good into the course of the afternoon. 19, about 20, even 21 or so. Top temperature today, by the way, 22 for Fangare. 21 tomorrow for Torong. You'll have a fine looking day. Similar sort of thing with those breezes. Just sort of notice it as you start off the day. The rain, most of the heavy stuff, eases back with our warning slowly going away for Gisbon as you go past midnight. Strong gusty winds and, of course, cloud clearing away for much of the east coast. Go to the afternoon. Things are much, much quieter as that low tracks its way east. Heads up for the strong winds too. First part of the day to New Ply, much quieter as that low tracks its way east. Heads up for the strong winds too, first part of the day to New Plymouth and part of Taranaki in that south to southwest direction. Everywhere else is fine looking day, it's sunshine bit on the breezy side at first, but you're in pretty good shape as well. You'll notice those winds in Wellington, good old gusty southerly, 15 degrees is where you finish. That should ease back as well by the course of the afternoon. Teuipunamo looks pretty decent too from Nelson down to Blenham all the way to Kikkora. It'll be cool for some to start with, but take your pick. You're all in pretty decent shape. And then tracked further south to Christchurch. 16 degrees is where we finish the day. Some cool spots. Four is where you start. You've got a fine looking day overall. Pretty decent. And track further south, further west, all good as well. As the high builds builds in looking at maybe just a little bits of mist and some fog and a few spots into the interior valleys four degrees for ashburton as you start off and it's probably going to be right on freezing for queensdown close two degrees not far off 18 is where you finish and go through the course of the day the rest of the far south is looking fine just might see a little bit more clouds similar sort of thing with the westerly may flick the far south is looking fine. Just might see a little bit more clouds. Similar sort of thing with the West City. May flick the odd shower to Invercago, but I think for most, after that chilly starts some early mist and some fog in the valleys, you're fine. 18 degrees to need and you're looking good. Different story for the Chattermounds. You've got that low tracking to your north. That goes well away by Friday. That's Friday. Frosty for some to start with. We get in, of course, to the long weekend. It's looking pretty good. A couple of blemishes. One front there. That's Friday. Frosty for some to start with. We get in, of course, to the long weekend. It's looking pretty good. A couple of blemishes. One front there, that's the far south, useful rain. And by the time we get to Sunday, we could be seeing some rain flirting with the far north, but we're trying to just keep that area of high pressure just in shape for the Easter Bunny and Easter to keep it in decent shape. Got it, Dan. Thank you very much for that. All right, let's head straight."}
