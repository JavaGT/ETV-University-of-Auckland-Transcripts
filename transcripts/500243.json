This is the first interprovincial match of the season, At Invercargo's rugby park today is a record wartime crowd. This is the first interprovincial match of the season and spectators are here to see Southland keep up its reputation. Getting the ball from the loose, the Southlanders push home the attack. From the opening kick they've kept up a whirlwind face. Within six minutes they've given Otago two bad frights and fought at one go. Already it looks like another win for Southland. Well, don't complain about the speed of the game. It's packed with thrills and excitement. It's packed with thrills and excitement. It's packed.

And Southland get the ball again to push home another attack. They're playing a great game today. They're up to their old Rand Ferry shield form, even if the shield's in cold storage for the duration. It's halfway through the first spell and the extra weight of the Otago forwards is beginning to tell. For the first time the home team is fighting in its own 25. Of particular interest to the crowd today are the young rep players. Southwenders have their eyes on their first 5-8 Walker, their first high school boy to play in a rep game. It looks as if Otago is getting on top. Their attacks getting dangerous and the clouds becoming anxious. A score! Campbell has backed his way over and Murdoch converts. It's the second half and Southland returns to the attack. They've got four points in hand but it's not a comfortable lead. Once again, Masters, Otago fullback stops and Southland returns to the attack. They've got four points in hand, but it's not a comfortable lead. Once again, Masters Otago fullback stops a Southland rush. Southland rush. Time's nearly up. Now it's Otago with a two-point lead. Southman keeps up the pressure, but they cannot breach the Otago line. It's Otago by 11 to 9. The members of the 43rd Division were most happy to have the opportunity to return to New Zealand a game after a long period of combat in the Solomon area. Our welcome was most hearty and everything possible has been done while we have been here for our comfort, our entertainment, and everything else that one people could possibly do for another. Here in Oakland, the 39th General Hospital of our Army is perhaps the finest installation of its kind anywhere outside the continental limits of the United States. The housing facilities that you have provided for American servicemen while in this country have been most adequate. We have, your camps have been located in some of the most beautiful country that I have ever seen in any part of the world We also all have an opportunity to Retrain the division for combat the terrain varied kinds of terrain that we have used here in New Zealand cannot help but fit us for the next combat that we will engage in. We have during our period here in an attempt to entertain you had various ceremonies, parades at which decorations have been awarded to the officers' men of this division that they earn in combat on New Georgia. The Decoration Day ceremony, which some of you saw, commemorates the last resting place of many of our soldier dead, who will perhaps stay here as a lasting reminder of the alliance between our two countries in this great war. I want to thank the people of New Zealand for their attendance here. Also want to say, one of the finest things that we've had the opportunity to do here has been to play American football. And it will always be one of the most pleasant memories that we will have of New Zealand with great interest, the people of New Zealand show in all kinds of sports. We've enjoyed our association with your people. We have enjoyed every moment of our stay here. And now we are leaving. And I want the people of New Zealand to feel, if such be the case, that you have made a distinct contribution to my division in its combat efficiency and in its will to fight and to put an end to this war. North of Casino and almost opposite the Anzio Beachhead, New Zealanders break through the German lines and get Jerry on the run. As the armored cars in clouds of dust reminiscent of the western desert, press along Route 5, village after village falls into our hands. Engineers work over time, locating mines, whilst the signal core re-established telegraph communications. The signal core reestablished telegraph communications. The country is so difficult that some units have to be supplied by mule trains, operated by Italian soldiers under New Zealand command. Refugees with their homes and farms and villages turned into a battlefield, try and escape from the reign of death that is modern war. Being a key point, the town of At supplies plundered by the New Zealand lines. The field security service questioning refugees obtains information which passed on to our 25 pounders helps to clean up a pocket of German resistance and Jerry takes the hint to get going and keep going.
