Getting ready for an exodus at Easter with COVID challenges and open borders, what can we expect for the long weekend at the Orange Alert level? And our Olympic Snow Queen stuns in Alaska, Zoe Sadowski Senate is fearless as she freestyles some gnarly backcountry. Is she going to stay up on this nose? What's she found? Oh my goodness. Cracks the seal on a whopper! Good evening. One of New Zealand's biggest mega churches is launching a review after accusations of mistreatment towards interns and volunteers. One news has spoken to many who describe feeling used by the church leading to burnout and claims they were shut down and shut out when issues are raised. Logan Church reports. This is a rise. A large modern church based in Wellington and it's growing across the country. There's a miracle just around the corner and if you believe it give your Jesus a loud praise all over the spirit. But there are serious concerns. There needs to be a whole culture's changed from the top down. It's led by its charismatic leader John Cameron. You're going to live with a feeling of hope. Yes. And my life counts. And I'm alive for a reason. And it's known for its slick productions and music. Every week around here to rise a bunch of people, in fact, nearly 2,800, I believe, serve in a myriad of different ways every single month to make a difference in the life of other people. Those are made up of volunteers, including interns from their ministry school. They offer year-long programs which people can apply for, unpaid, and we understand their thrust into countless roles in the church. Mentally and physically, you're pushing yourself to the point of exhaustion. This former volunteer was at the church for more than a decade. They left feeling burnt out. I remember seeing someone leaving, they were intern at the time, working at the rise conference, and they pushed themselves to the absolute breaking point, literally, where they would have to be carried out because it collapsed and needed to go to the absolute breaking point literally where they would have to be carried out because it collapsed and then go to the hospital and then you know emotionally it takes a toll on you as well you get put you sort of push your breaking point because you're just giving so much to yourself one news has heard many of these stories in turns feeling used and broken and it seems a rise is aware too you're defined by what God already did for you. This week revealing it's launching an external review. John Cameron saying on their website, there are people hurting because of the actions and culture of performance that was part of a rise. I want to say I am deeply sorry for any hurt caused. We are going to listen and learn. One news approached John Cameron for an interview, but that was declined. Instead, in a statement, the Arise Board says it takes all masses seriously and that it has a duty of care to ensure all complaints are dealt with robustly. It says the review will start after Easter. Those who used to call this church home say there are many people there with good intentions. But that can't mask, they say, the damage that's been done. It needs to be accountability and transparency. How much I think there's all that's up at the moment. On the eve of Easter, one of New Zealand's biggest churches trying to resurrect its reputation. Logan Church, One News. Ukraine says its remaining troops in Maripal have joined forces in a last-ditch fight for the strategic city. The U.S. is sending a further billion dollars of lethal aid to Ukraine for what's expected to be a brutal battle in the east. Here's Kimbeke-Wilson. After more than 50 days fighting, these Ukrainian soldiers could take no more. Russian state television showing footage of what it says is more than 1,000 soldiers surrendering. They appear wounded and wary. We had to surrender. We'd been encircled. One says, now a prisoner of war. We were going away from the shelling, says another. The details, and this footage, haven't been independently confirmed. Ukrainian officials say fewer than 200 have surrendered, and the fight for control of Maripol goes on. Defenders posted their own video, them hold up but still fighting. We won't give up, but we're encircled with no resupply of ammunition or food. Fighters elsewhere say they're preparing for death or capture and are also out of ammunition. Much more's on the way. Weapons and equipment like this seen in the U.S. It's sending more than a billion dollars worth. Additional assistance announced by President Joe Biden. I think this was a shift in policy in recognizing the tools that are needed. And for once, I mean, there was even armed personnel carriers listed on that. There were helicopters listed on it. Those are, that's different for sure. Giving Ukraine more capacity to counterattack. But they need to destroy the Russian convoys before they even get to the cities or near to the locations they want to take. Russia's throwing everything at Mariupol. It says it now has the city's port. Ukrainians are collateral damage. Why are they killing us? She asks. Survivors are in hospitals. Children who doctors say have injuries normally seen in soldiers from the battlefield. When the battle peaks in entrenched positions in the east, it will be brutal. We are on our own soil. We expect them to bury as many of them as possible. Preparing for a long and grinding frontline fight that could come at any time. Kimbaker-Wilson, one news. The toll of the Russian invasion is taking on Ukraine's youngest and most vulnerable is clear. The United Nations estimates nearly two-thirds of all Ukraine's youngest and most vulnerable is clear. The United Nations estimates nearly two-thirds of all Ukraine's children have fled their home since the conflict began. Nearly three million are displaced within Ukraine and two million have fled to neighboring countries. The deaths of 153 children have been verified, but it's believed the number is much higher, and they are in imminent danger. In the first five weeks of the conflict, Save the Children's charity, says 22 schools a day came under attack. The charity says the long-term trauma can't be overestimated. This, as an operation, is underway in the towns to the north of Ukraine's capital, to document evidence of alleged war crimes by the retreating Russian army. It's hoped any information gathered could persuade an international court to hold the Kremlin and its soldiers responsible. The BBC's Mark Lowen reports. Ten more. The numbers. The mass graves. The contempt for life. Some so badly charred, they're just the pieces for Ukraine to pick up. What happened here in Boucher and elsewhere are not just sins, says Ukraine, but war crimes. French investigators and other international teams are helping prepare a lawsuit against Russia. Ukraine's prosecutor general says they've already opened more than 6,000 cases. A lot of people speak about genocide of Ukrainian people. Vladimir Putin himself, he is president of aggressor. Do you believe you will ever see him judged in an international war crimes court? It's very important to whole world to stop dictators. The challenge for prosecutors will be to establish a line of command from the grave to the top of the Russian state to show that crimes are not just committed but ordered. Perhaps that will help give Ukrainians a sense of accountability and that from such suffering can come justice. The long road to that goal, past a landscape of horror, is led not just by the state, but by volunteer investigators, a grassroots army fighting for the truth. They come to Borodianca, gutted from the air in a relentless assault. Amidst the ruins ruins banned cluster bombs. We are trying not to let Russia formulate their lying narratives about the war in Ukraine. We are trying to show to people that those war crimes, which Russian troops are committed, became like a pattern of their behavior. Among the shattered sea of victims are Oksana Labba and her husband Nikola. With the need to tell the story comes the duty to collect it. Our home was our cozy nest. We were planning our children's birthday here. My mother got out just before the strike. It's hard to describe our terror. It's more like hate. It's very important to say what happened because these are not just war crimes. Russia will not stop until it destroys our country. Freedom and safety. What Ukrainians held dear has been destroyed. Their solace now would be punishment for those who have broken this country. And there are conflicting reports about an explosion on a flagship Russian warship off Ukraine's coast. Russia says the missile cruiser, seen here before the blast, was severely damaged by its own ammunition exploding. But an official in Odessa says it was hit by Ukrainian missiles. As many as 500 crew were on board the ship, which has now been evacuated. Back home now, our environment is continuing to decline, and it's affecting our health and well-being, according to a new report. But environmental activists say we need to look at how we measure our impact on the world and how we collect the data for it to be more useful in the fight to clean up our surroundings. Vandenabahn reports. Flash floods, extreme rainfall and drought. The pressures on our environment have never been clearer. And the government's three yearly status report shows it's continuing to decline. We still are saying loss of wetlands, loss of forest, loss of species. Things aren't getting better. So I think the real call to policymakers to government at regional and central levels is that whatever you've been doing is not fixing the problem. The State of the Environment report also for the first time looking at how it's affecting our health and well-being. We know that if the rivers are sick, the people will be sick. So thinking about a holistic way of seeing the environment and our relationship to it is useful. But it's nothing we didn't know already. It's not particularly picking up anything new. There are some things that we don't know a lot about, and some of the data inevitably is old. Experts say we're not measuring and reporting on the environment well enough and often enough. We sort of need an honest diagnosis the way you would from the doctor. You need to know what is actually going on here and then we can deal with it. We do need better information as to the state of our water quality. I agree with some of those criticisms from people that say we need more data and it is coming. That's why these reports will now be published once every six years rather than three. Officials say it will give enough time to update the data and bring it all together. In the next six years, you can hold the government to account as to whether we've stopped wetlands being filled in, whether we've got improving outcomes for the places that people swim in rivers. A call for more time in what's already been declared a climate emergency. Van Dnabahn, 1 News. There's been a breakdown between nurses and the DHBs over the latest pay equity offer. The Nurses Union deciding not to put it to its members to vote on next week as planned. The decision was made after legal advice it received, suggested there was an obligation on DHBs to offer full back payment to 2019, as had been previously agreed. It's really frustrating because nurses, as everyone knows, have been at the front line for so long, and they're absolutely exhausted, and they saw the correction of long-standing sex-based discrimination is absolutely critical. The union will talk to its members before they vote on either taking the matter to the Employment Authority or voting on the offer in its current form. Today, Andrew Little said the government was committed to making sure nurses are paid more fairly, but it couldn't pay for decades of underpayment. The long Easter weekend's about to start with Kiwis around the country heading away under the new less restrictive orange traffic light settings, but travellers are being urged to be prepared in case COVID-19 disrupts their plans while they're away from home. The Anahuahuri Hanganoi with what you need to know. The sun is out and so are Easter holiday makers. We're just going to try and just keep it to the friends and family at the moment. COVID on the minds of these new arrivals from Australia. We just stay away from crowds as much as possible. We're our face masks everywhere and yeah, just basically stick to ourselves really. Stick in the fresh air. So a bit of a quick whip around and see the grandparents and, yeah, keep it simple. With an exodus of travellers heading away this weekend, health officials are urging everyone to make a plan in case they catch COVID. If we get sick and we're staying with other family, we probably just want to get home and being in our own home, being able to isolate, but other people, that's not going to be practical. For those who can't get home, the Ministry of Health recommends staying put and self-isolating. If we do get COVID, we can stay where we are. Others aren't worried. I've experienced a whole year lockdown in the UK, and so hence why I'm not walking around with a mask, and I'm just over it. I think I'll probably be okay, because I've already had COVID a few weeks ago, so I'm hoping that immunity will last. But the holiday hotspot of Fangamatar's on each, with large numbers of visitors about to arrive. People are a fairly long way away from help in these kind of communities. You've got limited access to ambulances and it's a long distance to hospitals. She's also concerned for locals. Our elderly population is pretty vulnerable, obviously, people are bringing COVID into the community. When you're not eating Easter treats, remember, masks remain mandatory when you're shopping and on public transport, and that includes flying. We're still seeing thousands of cases a day, so COVID's still out there. Making a sensible plan key to a happy holiday. There they all are. Tianawa is with us, along with reporters across the country, to fill us in on what the Easter holiday weekend could bring where you are. Firstly, Tianawa, what can we expect in the city of sales? Kiyo-a-Malissa. Well, it's been a beautiful night here in Auckland, and settled weather is forecast over the next few days, but Maritime New Zealand is urging Boutis to take extra care out on the water as the days get much colder and the nights get darker earlier now for those using the motorways over the weekend there are a number of overnight closures and motorists are being advised to avoid spaghetti junction overnight if they can they can check the NZTA website for more details and detour information. People don't have to worry they will get to where they need to go this Easter. Well, many here in Wellington will be excited to hit the new transmission Gully Road for their holidays, but police are warning not to get complacent in your driving just because it's a new road. And across the nation, roads are expected to be incredibly busy, especially tonight and on Monday night. So the advice there, take the night off, drive it off peak hours, drive to the conditions, stay safe, and because we don't want a repeat of last year when nine people were killed on our road. So spare a thought for our emergency services this weekend. They too deserve a break. Meanwhile here in Christchurch, hospitality venues are expecting a big weekend. I spoke to the Oxford Group, who owned six bars here in the city, and they described the last few months as the worst time ever, saying they've been turning a loss and turnover has more than half. So Orange came as a bit of a surprise. They weren't expecting it, but they are delighted and keen to get things back and running. The new limits under Orange mean no masks and no limits, and so they're expecting a few big nights as people get out onto the dance floor to blow some steam off. The only spanner in the works are the Easter trading laws. They can't do too much on Friday, but don't you worry, they've got a solution. Many of the bars here on the terrace behind me are going to open their doors at midnight on Friday night so they can party right through to 3 a.m. And Queenstown, too, will be certainly looking forward to a boost in visitor numbers over the long weekend. I've been told by the Chamber of Commerce their bookings are looking strong over the next few days and that's been put down to a domestic crowd. It's because the direct flights from Australia to Queenstown aren't happening for at least another month as they wind up to the much-anticipated winter ski season. However, since the borders have reopened with Australia, I've been told that passenger numbers from Auckland to Queenstown have increased, so they'll be welcoming people here with open arms over the next few days, particularly too, as Thomas mentioned, under the Orange Traffic Light. And here in Orti Porte-Den, there's plenty on offer, but here at the Botanic Garden, the Highlanders finally have a chance to host their first face-to-face community event of the year, so they'll be holding a Easter egg hunt here from 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. But if chocolates, not your thing and you're more into the sports side of things, you can catch the Highlanders take on the Hurricanes at Forsyth Bar Stadium on Saturday night.

Speaking a short time ago, she used the opportunity to apologise to her local Manoriwa members for what she called unconstitutional actions by the party during the 2020 election campaign. The way they were treated in order to punish me is reprehensible and it is as a result of that corrupt process that I'm standing to deliver my valedictory statement today. In her time in Parliament, Lewis Will championed legislation that saw social change, including marriage equality. The parents of an Australian woman set alight and killed by a Kiwi man have spoken out for the first time since the inquest into her murder. Tauranga-born Rowan Baxter killed Hannah Clark and their three children in Brisbane in 2020. Hannah had previously raised the alarm about his behaviour, prompting questions about police processes. Here's Australia correspondent. Andrew McFarlane. It's the brutal murder that horrified Australia and New Zealand. Hannah Clark and her three young children killed by Tauronga man, Rowan Baxter. It was a premeditated killing. The former Warriors rugby league player had gone to a Bunnings warehouse to buy supplies two days before setting the family vehicle alight with petrol in a quiet street. Are you angry? Always. Yeah. I'm just sad. There's no one to be angry at now For the first time since the two-week inquested to her death Hannah's parents have spoken exclusively with Australia's Channel 9 Hannah had told them Baxter was a bully And she feared he was going to kill their children The police were fantastic to Hannah She met a wonderful constable when she walked into the police station Who helped her so much along the way. She was one of the very lucky ones. Do you know how wrong that sounds that we're seeing here saying that Hannah was one of the lucky one? Yeah. But unfortunately at the moment, it's 50-50. Already the coroner suggested better domestic violence training for Australia's police. There'd been a history with the court shown this body cam footage after Baxter took one of the kids on Boxing Day 2019. Very hard to watch Hannah so upset. But it was also nice to hear a voice. Hannah's parents aren't just mourning their daughter but three grandkids too. We'll never go away. Yeah. The hardest thing is, I think for me, is not knowing what the kids could have become. Yeah. They had some great futures. Yeah. But obviously it wasn't meant to be. Yeah. The inquest's findings will be released in late June. Hannah's parents hope they'll help stop anything like this happening again. Andrew McFarlane, One News, Sydney. A man's been arrested in relation to yesterday's subway shooting in New York. Frank R. James is charged with a terror-related offence after setting off smoke grenades and opening fire in a train car in a Brooklyn station. 29 people were hurt in their attack. Police believe the alleged gunman may have tipped them off himself. They received a call saying, I think you're looking for me before disclosing where he was found. Shanghai officials have admitted, thus struggling to feed people as residents in the city of 25 million are ordered to stay inside amid an omicron surge. Those who test positive are being forcibly housed inside quarantine facilities. Just how poorly equipped they are is now coming to light. The BBC's Robin Brandt is in south lockdown in Shanghai and sent this report. More than two years after COVID first emerged here, China is still trying to keep it out. And this is how it's doing it. Tens of thousands of people forced into government-run quarantine. In one of China's most advanced cities, the conditions for some are awful. The moment I really broke down was when I entered the cabin hospital. We spoke to this 26-year-old. She tested positive a few days ago. In China, symptoms or no symptoms, you are forced to quarantine. We were first assigned to the shared area. The condition was terrible. My roommate and I found two camp beds. There were only one restroom and one wash based on each floor. Many sleep next to each other. I was terrified. I broke down and cried. Forced quarantine is one of two often brutal measures that China is using to try to beat COVID. The other is citywide lockdowns. I'm two weeks into the one here, along with the other 25 million people that live in Shanghai. Now, for many, that means you can't step out of your gate. For some, it means you can't even go beyond your front door. And also, daily worries about food. For some, even about water. For some, the plight is now desperate, a battle to place an order on your phone or a fight with the authorities, all just to get food in. But this has become less about science. It's now a battle between a resurgent virus and Communist Party credibility. Every province in this country has been told to prepare facilities like this as fears of a nationwide wave spread. Old, young, up until a few days ago, babies all were quarantined on their own. In China, it's the price they pay, the sacrifice they make. Me Utonu Mai, stay with us.

Gaila Ano, members of the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra played a new and special piece this week. It's composer, a 12-year-old boy from Australia, who wrote it shortly before he died. Katie Stevenson was there, as some of his loved ones watched on. In his happy place, self-taught musician Kayan Penel on the Keys, entertaining a crowd. Kian died tragically in a farming accident at the end of January. His mother, later finding a classical composition he'd written. He'd talked about wanting to get the notes that he had out of his head onto paper, but I didn't realise that at the same time, he must have actually been learning how to read music and how to write music as well. Wanting to hear the piece, Amanda put a call out to orchestras across Australia who brought it to life. We were able to then play this at his funeral, which was incredible that he, in essence, had created his own funeral song but played by other people. His family in Christchurch unable to attend due to COVID. This week, experiencing his special work thanks to members family in Christchurch unable to attend due to COVID, this week experiencing his special work thanks to members of the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra. How did you feel listening to that performance? Tough. It's lovely. Emotional also for the musicians I think music has this amazing ability to help people process emotions The really hard times So it was I always feel a great privilege To be a part of that experience for people Kain's family hopeful It continues to be a part of that experience for people. Kain's family hopeful it continues to be played. What legacy, yeah. And that's what we're celebrating, not the fact that he's died. Kain's music destined to live on long after playing his last note. Katie Stevenson, One News. Just an update on our story from last night about Peter, the T-Rex, who's been put on display at Auckland Museum. There's just released time-lapse footage showing the rest of his 200 pieces being installed, including his powerful jaw. A big effort by the museum team who battled COVID-19 and shipping delays, but they were determined Peter would be ready for the school holidays. To the world's oldest gorilla who's celebrating her 65th birthday at Berlin Zoo. Here's Fetal, enjoying her cake made out of rice, raspberries, blueberries and lettuce.

Experience has won on the final stop of the Natural Selection Tour in Alaska, and Zoe Sadowski-Sinit missed out on a finals' birth for the first time. But her third place means she keeps her incredible run of gold, silver or bronze, intact. Here's how her performance is stacked up over the past 14 events. She's competed in across World Cup's X Games and other top events. She's yet to miss a podium, two of her last four events, true pinnacles, an Olympic gold and silver medal. And while the latest result isn't Zoe's best, the performance was no less or inspiring. Holding a backcountry freestyle contest in Alaska is no joke. That right there is base camp. We're living in tents. And the terrain matches the athletes' living conditions, huge spines that hide their landings. It's like the boss battle kind of. It's the biggest one and the gnarliest terrain. Zoe Sadowski's in it might hold a full set of Olympic medals, but backcountry riding is a different kettle of fish. She saw a stomp at double cork 1080 at the Olympics a couple of months ago that reverberated around the world. What can she do here in Alaska? What she can do is blow mines. Oh my goodness! As she finds one of the gnarliest drops of the event. Cracks the seal on a whopper! It's phenomenal! How quickly she's acclimatized to Alaskan terrain. So quickly that on their first run she beat backcountry legend Hannah Beeman, who's been competing since 1988. That's 13 years before Zoe was even born. So, in run two, the 39-year-old upped the ante. Back three, beautiful! Oh, that was lovely. Oh, and landing the backflip. Okay, okay, Hannah. That run put enormous pressure on Zoe, and she didn't hold back. Oh, and she's over the front. And she takes those kinds of things in her stride. Lovely front three. That was very beautiful. Oh, no, and going down at the very bottom. Zoe missing the final of a natural selection event for the first time in her career. Beeman going on to take the title before the Alaskan weather closed in and kicked the riders off the mountain. Wow. I couldn't see shit. Mother Nature won in the end. Put the rubber stamp away for the time being. There's a delay in rugby's $300 million silver lake private equity deal. The 26 provincial unions were due to vote on the deal at the NZR's AGM in two weeks. That's now on hold. One news understands some unions want more time to do due diligence. It's believed some are also not entirely happy with their take of the revised deal compared to the 36.5% slice the professional players get. There's a feeling among some unions. If their payment isn't increased, the deal could fall over. It's understood some unions are balking at another part of the deal, a complete governance review of the game. Liverpool and Manchester City could soon be sick of the sight of each other as they remain on collision course in multiple competitions. There's the FAA Cup semi-final this weekend and a potential European Cup showdown after both sides navigated contrasting court final ties in the Champions League this morning. Here's Chris Chang. You can't say Manchester City weren't warned about Atlago Madrid, the Champions League's ultimate street fighters. Who loved nothing more than winding their opponents, pushing it to breaking point. Pushing, try kicking. Pulling, shirts, hair, losing their heads and butting them into others. The wind-up merchants conducted by the Master of the Dark Arts, Diego Simeone. His fourth officials had enough of him. There was some football played at the Wanda Metropolitan. Excellent run-made by Walker superbly found and he was looking to tease somebody up. Phil Foden, John the one! Oh, it's in the posting come back and then it's blocked and then it's brought us in there. Manchester City withstanding the dirty tactics and immense pressure to hold on to their precious 1-0 lead from the first leg. They refused to let Athletico Madrid, wind them up and grind them down. City into the semis, against Aaleko's fierce rivals, Real Madrid. Although the home side still fancy to crack in the tunnel after full time. On the other side of the draw, Liverpool, who are chasing city in the league, seem intent on catching up with them in Europe too. Their 6-4 aggregate win over Benfica, setting up a contest with Villarreal in the final four. But even though the Portuguese side pulled a couple of goals back at Anfield, histories on their side. The last two times they beat Benfica in the quarterfinals, they went on to lift the European Cup. The quadruple is still on. But their sky-blue Premier League rivals may be standing in their way at every turn. Chris Chang, One News. Blackcaps bowler Tim Salthy has capped off a stellar season in style, winning New Zealand's Crickets Supreme Award. His hall of wickets in both the red and white ball game recognised, named winner of the Sir Richard Hadley Medal for the first time. So I'm very fortunate to have great bowlers around me, also great catches that make you look a bit better and your teammates. His 338 Tess wicket still shy of the 431 that once made Sir Richard the world record holder, a surprise appearance from the legend himself today with a word of encouragement to crack the milestone. It's time for me to let it go and for somebody else and if you are able to do that then I'd be very, very satisfied and pleased. Battered, Evan Conway, was named Test Player of the Year, following his standout made in season for the Blackhacks. A blowout win for the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference has kept playoff dreams a reality, winning the Do- or Die game over the Charlotte Hornets, 132, 103. Trey Young and DeAndre Hunter led the thumping for Atlanta, outscoring the Michael Jordan-owned side, 42-24 in the third quarter alone. Frustration boiled over for the Hornets. Miles Bridges ejected long before his team was for spraying some foul language at the ref and even telling a fan where to go. Oh, he just got teed up, he got to be careful and just got thrown out. There's automatic ejection. Bridges frustration, they need to get him away. Candidates, oh, a fan giving him some stuff as well. The Hawks now fly to Cleveland to face the calves. The winner will face top-placed Miami in the opening round of the playoffs. Every day we report on the highs, lows, history-making and epic feats of athletes around the world. Today, four separate events found their way into the same story thread. Each one a key part in the life cycle of sport. Michelle Prendel has more. Like most sporting careers, you start with a small fire, a desire. I was four years old when I started playing soccer. Trinity Rodman, the daughter of basketball grade Dennis. Sporting success could well have been coded in her DNA. Rodman! The youngest female ever drafted into the U.S. National Women's League, but this week she cracked her own personal feat. Three Rodman has her first goal in a U.S. uniform. From that moment in an athlete's career, more opportunities come by to shatter the glass ceiling. That's what Alyssa Nacken did last night off the bleachers into the ball game. She's an assistant coach of the San Francisco Giants, but when the head coach got ejected from the game, who stepped up? Hey, you're going, Nack. Nacken, already the first female coach in the league now, the first woman to ever coach at first base. I was prepared for this moment, so to go out there and just be ready to step in for that moment, it was a no-brainer and this is my job. It's a job that can span for decades. Alison Felix has now taken the gold medal. After seven Olympic titles across five games, the most decorated track and field athlete in US history, Alison Felix today announcing her retirement at the end of the season. It'll always be bittersweet just because I love the sport. I love what I do. But also, I felt at peace. You know, I feel like I've done everything that I wanted to do and more. So one final year before deciding how to share that lifetime of learning, after all, a legacy is what every athlete hopes to achieve. Like Trailblazer Shirley Spork, passing away today at the age of 94. Spork, one of the founders of the LPGA in 1950, laying the foundation to give women a place alongside the men's game. To think when we started, there were 11 of us out here trying to make a living, total prize money was $3,000. And look where it is today. We have a Kiwi woman, Lydia Coe, out there defending her title on her own journey of sports life cycle. Michelle Prenderwell, 1 News. And from all of those amazing women to the ones sitting right on. Oh, God, no compared to them. I'll take it, though. Thanks, Haley. Happy Easter. Dan has what the weather is doing at your place for the long weekend, that's next.

Well, it looks like Mother Nature is going to bring up quite a nice spell of weather for the Easter money for the long weekend and for all of us as well. And it already started this morning down south, George Zempsom, Tecapo. Lovely sunny start. Frosty here, right to freezing bit of of us as well and it already started this morning down south George Emson Tecapo lovely sunny start frosty here right to freezing bit of morning fog as well whereas of course to the East Coast thing quietening down take a look at this things are quite different for the likes of that Napier went back to the weather map clearer skies there already that system moving away there's your area of high pressure for the long weekend couple of things to point out one little lump of cloud there and the southern ocean they're gonna creep in and bring some of us some wet weather but overall in the meantime the big area of high pressure for the long weekend. Couple of things to point out, one of the lump of cloud there and the southern ocean. They're going to creep in and bring some of us some wet weather. But overall, in the meantime, the big area of high pressure sets in, and that's going to be a fine looking next couple of days. With the clearer skies, light winds, expect temperature to drop again like they did to the far south last night, touches the frost. But this time, the frost will actually be a bit further north. More of a westerly drift keeps things stirred up down south. See the blue? Central Plateau, yet are freezing all below. Not as much, but it's going to be a cold night as well, however you want to slice it. Great looking day. High will settle in. The one thing we will just start to see through the course of the day. We'll drag in a bit more cloud from that approaching front. That hits the far south going into Saturday morning, strengthens the wind. You'll probably see through increasing cloud for that. Maybe the odd shower to the Bay of plenty, but looking pretty decent as you get through the end of the week. This is much of Northland, Kaitaya, even down to Fittiyanga. 20, 21, great looking day for you. A little bit of a cooler feel, some sevens, some nines. Auckland as well, lovely day for you. 21 degrees. You'll be seeing some cool spots as well, Nine, for instance, for Waitakari, but overall in pretty decent shape. Grab those extra layers you just step to the outside and the paddock in parts of Waikata 4 for Hamilton. Tickwitti, you're two. You've got great looking day, though, 20 or 21. And for much of the Bay of Plenty, down to the central platter. Cold, frosty start. A few little showers are flicking their way through. May see them around the Bay of plenty. Fakatane. Maybe a late day shower, but again, it's isolated. And look at those starting temperatures. Tamalui, 2 degrees. So you could even be close to freezing as you start with, but a great looking day. Toronga as well. Chance for an afternoon shower, 20 degrees. Lovely looking day overall. And notice some of these starting members, some lower single figures, and that's certainly the case to the East Coast. Lovely, sunshine, dry things out, but look at that Danny Burke, Masterton. You're sitting at 1, 2 degrees as you start off the course of the day. Fine, as well, heading further west. New Plymouth, 18 for you, right the way down to the lower north end, and even some of these temperatures of the lower north end, from 3, some 4. So, yeah, it will be a chilly one. Wellington. We've got 17. Great looking day for you. You've all pretty decent as well. Lower Hut C's 20. Taiwipunamo, take your pick. You're all in good shape as well. Nelson, Kaikora. Major see a little bit of early clouds. Same onto the West Coast there. For Westport, 19, 20 degrees for most. And for Christchurch. Got some morning cloud, get rid of that. 17, and it is pretty decent as well. Now, as you track south and west, some of that cloud laps in towards the west coast. The first part of the day, get rid of that, 17, and it is pretty decent as well. Now, as you track south and west, some of that cloud laps in towards the west coast. First part of the day, get rid of that. You're all fine, and a cool start, Ashburton, Timoroo, and then you are fine as well, 17 or 18. 18 for Queenstown as well. Some early cloud, some of that morning mist and fog, like we typically see. You're fine. Alexander, you see 19 degrees, three for you where you start, and looking at the rest of the fast. All fine. Milford Sound picks up some late-day showers. I think everyone else would just pick up some late-day cloud, but you're also fine, dry. That front then tracks in for Saturday. Dan Eden, you're great. You've got 19 degrees. 19. Lovely sunshine. All in pretty good looking shape. Now, Saturday front. It's a quick little blast of strong winds, kicks a quicksouth west, a spell of rain. Energy energy goes east so it fades away. So by Easter Sunday, the bunnies jump and about saying, hey, this is a good day. One other thing to point out, the far north, a little tropical low. Watch for that to Northland, Sunday, maybe even Easter Monday, just heads up maybe northern parts of Auckland. But overall, for the long weekend, we're trying to get that high into a nicer place and looking pretty decent for quite a few of us. Thank you so much, Dan. And it is time now for Seven Sharp with Hilary and Jeremy. Thanks, Melissa."}
