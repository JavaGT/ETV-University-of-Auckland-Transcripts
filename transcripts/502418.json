It's like a real pub quiz, but it doesn't end with a bad loser shouted and Zimuni Blues, tell ya. Please show you appreciation for the man with all the answers. It's the fact father himself, Sean Williamson. Here he is. And battling it out to become Pubbush Champions, we've got the Mouldery from stevenage and the plough from london hey! Yes to help them out of two team cuttins giving themselves a pep talk in the judges we speak it's Andy Parsons and James May fantastic! Our captains! And that beautiful tune you're hearing is supplied by our resident pianist Kirsty Newton. Take it away, Kirstie! Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh. Oh, we've got some great quizzing ahead, but let's take a look at what the teams are competing for. The perfect prize for a pub-based program. It's the great British pub quiz tankard. Ooh! I fear to look, and yet I cannot turn away. Right, and look, what's inside, eh? It's Â£1,000 British pounds. Oh, come on. Yes. Capitalism for the win. Sean, are you looking forward to the quiz? I am, but I must point out we don't have an entertainment's licence for the pub quiz. The council have been down to watch and they decided we didn't need one. Ha! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let's meet the teams. Andy, who are you quizzing with this evening? So I have the Mulberry tree from Stephen Edge, yeah. First up, we have Neil here. Neil is a music teacher. Oh, very cool job. He has got a transit van, and basically, it's soundproofed, and he goes round schools, he's got a little drum kit in there, and one-on-on-one tuition with kids is that right and they can make as much noise as they like and nobody gives a monkeys now let me tell you my kid is learning the ukulele at the moment and I want your van and this is Rachel this is sister Rachel wonderful and Rachel is a financial advisor oh and this is boyfriend Paul this is sister Rachel. Wonderful. And Rachel is a financial advisor. Oh. And this is boyfriend Paul along here, who is IT engineer. And Rachel's very keen to win this pub quiz, because they've never, ever, in their lives, won a pub quiz ever before. You'd say maybe quite ambitious to win a pub quiz on national television, having never won them before. I think we've got a picture of the Mouldby Tree. Oh, that's a lovely pub, isn't it? Lovely. It looks like some sort of Victorian theme part, that isn't it? It does a little bit, yeah, yeah. Okay, we'll round of applause to the Mowby Tree. Okay, and now, James May and the Plough, what you've got? Tell us all about it. Well, this is indeed the plough from Battersea. We have an eclectic mix of skills. We've got Pierre in IT. Wonderful. And we've got Gerald, who is a picture mounter. And then we have Dave, who sells equipment for repairing roads to various highways agencies. So if the questions are about digitally mounting a picture of a dug-up road somewhere in the south-east of England will absolutely... You're shoo-in. And the plough, I did a bit of reading on your pub. The plough is quite interesting because it was once described as the worst pub in Battersea, I think. But have since been transformed into something right up your street owl, which is a gastro pub. Oh, really? I know. The word gastro belongs in front of the word enteritis. Let's just have a look. We've got a picture of the plough. It follows this new trend of making a pub look like the ground floor of a department store. There's someone's just written the plough on a piece of old bed seat and then. It's nicer on the inside. It's niceer on the inside. Okay, and so Gerald, Hello. Picture Mouter. Yes. What sort of pictures do you mount? What are we talking? What don't I'm out? I don't know. I'd like to thank you for walking yourself into that track. Is this one on the buzzer? Well, what don't you mount, Gerald? What I do mount is do pictures for the royals, royal family. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pictures of Prince pictures of the royals, royal family. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pictures of Prince Charles. We do Prince Charles' work. Really? Yeah, yeah. Wow, amazing. Incredible. Okay, ladies' gentlemen, it's the plough from Battersea. Let's start things off with our first round, one too many. In this round, I'll ask each team of questions, show them four answers, but there is one too many. In this round, I'll ask each team of questions, show them four answers, but there is one too many. One of the answers shouldn't be there. Which one is the odd one out? That's what they must deduce. The plastic umbrella in the pint of lager. The mulberry tree, you can go first because I think you need every break of life to give you. Okay, here's your first question. All of these animals are depicted on these country's national flags apart from. Cows on the flag of Andorra, a lion on the Spanish flag, Spain's flag, an eagle on the Kazakhstan flag and a dolphin on the flag of Papua New Guinea. One of them is wrong, which one? I feel like the Spanish one's right. It's definitely got a line on the front of that one. Yeah, the big thing, the eagle seems right. Where's Andorra? It's in the... Between... I mean, we're promising start....on the Pyrenees between France and Spain, I think. Yeah, I think a cow on a flag is a bit weird. Yeah. A dolphin on a flag isn't weird. Well, they're all a little bit weird. What do you want to go for, team? I think... I think... Andorah cow. Andorah, we What do you want to go for, team? I go for... I think... Andorah cow. We... Do you think the Andorah cow is the wrong one on there? Well, the Spanish flag does have a line on it. The flag of Kazakhstan does have an eagle on it. But Papua New Guinea doesn't have a dolphin on it. I'm afraid that's the one that's wrong. The flag of Papua New Guinea actually features a silhouette of a Ragiana bird of paradise. That's right. The design was chosen through a nationwide design competition in 1971. And the winners of a 15-year-old girl called Susan, who did it with some felt tips. It's like getting blue Peter into around the country. Totally ridiculous. The flag of Andorra does have cows on it. It does. There go. Oh my God. That Latin slogan means it's cows, you muppets. No, obviously the flag of Honduras are actually closely linked to the flag of Scotland, and not because of the design, but because you won't see either in flying at a World Cup. Oh, shut up. The lion. The lion is on the Spanish coat of arms. One of those lions. Exactly like that. That's what lions look like. One of those lions. I'm looking forward to your impression of the eagle coming up. And Sean will now take us to the... The Eagle of Kazakhstan, not only a beautiful flag, is my second favourite Harry Potter film. There we go. Okay, the plow. Here's your one too many. All of these fruits are berries apart from one. Banana. Apple, tomato, grape. What is the definition of a berry? Some of the berries are actually not berries. Some of the berries are not berries? Yeah, I think some of the... one of the... some of the strawberries and stuff, but that's not up there, but... They're not strictly berries, so... Are you trying to play a game that we're not playing? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Could the grape not be in there? A berry needs to have a seed, so an apple's got a seed, a tomato's got a seed. Grape's got a seed? Go for the banana. I'd go for banana. You go for the banana? Well, you're wrong. It's the apple. The apple isn't a berry. That's right. On what basis? Well, I'll tell you what. Sean, what is the definition of a berry? It has to have two or more seeds, but from one flower with one ovary. And I think if it's any more than one ovary, it becomes, it's a fruit. Right. That's bleeding obvious. Yeah. Yeah. You think about it. Staring you in the face when you think about it. Yeah. Right, the mulberry tree. Here's your next one too many. All of these are genuine street names named after a musician apart from Rihanna Drive in Barbados, Justin Bieber Boulevard in Canada, George Harrison close in Liverpool and Bob Marley Avenue in Jamaica. George Harrison's got to be right because it's... Yeah, I feel like that's got to be right. It has to be right, surely. Why would you name a road off to Justin Bieber? Exactly. I went to see him. Did you? Yeah. Oh dear. Yeah, it was terrible. A Bieber? I feel like the Bob Marley one's probably right as well. It annoys me, but it's going to be Biber's going to be right, isn't it? Yeah, I think Rihanna's wrong. Rihanna's wrong. Okay. So, because when the other two don't know, you come in, right, Paul. It shuts us down. Are we happy to go with Rihanna Drive? You're going Rihanna Drive? Yeah. Yeah, we're happy with it. Rihanna. Rihanna Drive? You're going Rihanna Drive? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're happy with it. Rihanna. Rihanna Drive in Barbados is wrong. He's Justin Bieber Boulevard. As you said, who'd name anything after Justin Bieber. But there's never been a Justin Bieber Boulevard in Canada. The problem, of course, with having a Bob Marley Boulevard is the traffic is always jamming. Come on. Come on. Here's the final question to the plough. All of these are genuine professional athletes apart from. Jackie Saddle from horse racing, Scott Speed from motor racing, Peter Bowler from cricket, and Varnia, Stumbleover, Hurdling. Stumbleover? Stumbleover? Stambalover, that's, you know, like Justin Beaver was so obvious. Maybe we should be going for the obvious one here. I don't know, but... Stumbleover. Stumbleover doesn't sound like a name, does it? Stambalowler? I don't know. I think you would have heard of her. I think speed sounds... I've never heard of anybody called speed. You've heard of a stumbleover. Well, that sounds like a name. An answer, please. Ania, Stambola. Yeah, it's got stumble over. Stumble over, please, landlord. Varnia, stumbleover. You think it's not the genuine professional athlete, but you're wrong. It's Jackie Saddle. Jackie Saddle. Sean, Peter Bowler? Yeah, a right-handed batsman, 19,000 first-class runs and he bowled right-hand off break. That's right. Varnia Stumbleover during the London 2012 Olympics, Stumbleover tripped while competing in the 400 metres hurdle event and failed to finish. You can hear the commentators now, and stumble over! Stambolover! Right, so, at the end of round one, it's over to Sean for our score. Well, we're all waiting for this. After that first round, both teams are yet to score. Okay, now it's that time where Sean comes out from behind the bar carrying a very strange-looking item, so it's time time where Sean comes out from behind the bar carrying a very strange looking item. So it's time to play. What is it? Marbley Tree, you're up first. Here's Sean to present you with your mystery object. There we go, no expense, bird. Voila. What is it? What is it? Thank you, ladies and... No, Rachel's got it. Describe it to us, Rachel. It's like a nutcracker. A nutcracker. If we have a little look, it's a little lever lifts up. You've got three little indentations here. Maybe if somebody's been playing the piano badly, way to punish them, something like that. It'd be very old from Victorian or something, because it's... Yeah, but what is the significance of the But you obviously grew they're all different size holes aren't they look pencils? Pencils pencil. So something for making pencils maybe crushing a pencil Let's look at four possible options What would have been pressed in this corks sweets bullets or nuts? I think nuts is too obvious because that was my initial reaction Yeah and it's an old shaped nut isn't it and corks, sweets, bullets or nuts? I think nuts is too obvious because that was my initial reaction. Yeah. And it's an old shaped nut, isn't it? And corks wouldn't be that big or nuts? It could be sweets. Like they made big strips of sweets and they did that just to crush them. Oh yeah, because the... Like stick of rock. They put a stick of rock that make a big long out there and they just break it into sections. There are little grooves in the top, aren't they? Yeah. Sweets. Sweet. It's actually corks. Oh. Oh. Sean, explain. There you go. You're hard up the mold tree. So what it was, this very ornate item would have been fixed to the counter of a pharmacy. And in those days, they made corks for their medicine bottles by hand. So wet cork would be compressed into whichever size compartment was needed to fit the bottle. And now we come to the plough. This is your What Is It? What is it? What is it? Sean, show them. Let's find out. Such a big item, this. Just had to put it under this big......cloc. Oh. Good luck. What is it? Not the cushion. It looks so much like buttons, don't they? But buttons is too old. I know it's too long. It's got a pointy bit on it. It'll certainly be a disappointment if you've just got buttons after what we have. But this one doesn't have a prick on it, yeah. Ah, that's a massive clue, isn't it? Spindle. Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll give you four options. What would these have helped you to do? Identify a fellow Mason, keep a corpse's eyes closed, escape enemy territory or pay for goods. Hang on, hang on, hang on. It's a compass. Hang on, hang on. Put one on top of the other, and then you can find north. Yeah. So it would... It's a compass. It's a compass. You think it's a compass? Yeah, because you've got one with a pin. One with a pin. One with a groove. You put one on top of the other, and I think there's a north-south-edged into it. And it's turning, and it's going... It's a compass. Very good. So it's for escaping from enemy territory. Yeah, we're going for enemy territory on that one. Well, I've heard some far-fetched things in my time, Mr. James May, but you're right. That's right. That's exactly. Sean will explain, but you've got that dead right. That was brilliant, wasn't it? They're a scape. Oh, unbelievable. Well done, fellow. Well done. So, as you're quite rightly said, one button has a tiny pin spindle on top there. I'll just make that out on the camera. And the other has a very small indent on it, as you quite rightly said. And you can balance one on top of the other. And eventually, that will settle itself down and tell you where magnetic north is. And from there, off you top of the other, and eventually that will settle itself down and tell you where magnetic north is. And from there, off you go. Well done, guys. Sean, what's that done to our scores? The plough showing their magnetism there. They're three-nil up. Three-nil up. Long way to go, though. Long way to go. Great, thanks, Sean. Who will win and who will lose? We can't say yet. Literally, the only way of finding out is to keep watching after this break. So see you in a bit. Take it away, Kirstie. Come along for the ride.

Nespresso, what else? Welcome back to Al Murray's Great British Pub Quiz. The quiz that questions everything. Well, we're still joined by James Mayender Plower and Andy Parsons is with the Maltry Tree. Okay, up next is one of my favourite rounds where we show you some photos from mine and Sean's trips around the world. It's time then for Al and Sean's holiday snap. Gerald, you're pretty well travelled, I understand. Yeah, I've done a bit of travelling on my motorbike, yeah. Where have you been? Optic Circle, Tromzo, rode across America, shipped my bike out. It was cheaper than hiring a Harley. Baltimore to L.A. Wow. By a, was it, Route 66, Death Valley. I think we've got a picture of you in Route 66 as well. Yes. Wow. Check it out. Could be anywhere. Anywhere, could be anyone. Absolutely. Middlesbrough. Right. Okay. Neil, you've been to Rome sightseeing, I believe. Yes, that's correct. Take us through your Rome experience. Well, at the time, I didn't have anyone to go with. I thought, how can I do this in a different way? So I went there and back in a day. I left home at 3 o'clock and then spent the whole day there and come back and was in bed by about 1 o'clock in the morning. That's one hell of a National Express bus, that? Well, as the great philosopher, Luke Goss said Rome wasn't built in a day. You can see it in a day. You can see it in a day. Incredible. Well, amazing. You're a nutcase. This round is on the buzzer. Okay, so I'm going to show you three photos from a landmark that we visited. And the first team to correctly figure out where we've been will win the points. Buzz, announced correctly on the first photo. There's three points. two for the second, and one for the third as it becomes clearer where we've been, right? And by the third photo, honestly, you're all to get it. But buzzing incorrectly, and you'll be locked out the question, so it'll pass over to the other team and they'll be able to answer at their leisure. Here's your first one. Where are we? And it's just a good job I refuse to let them Photoshop my body. If that's your body, that's some time ago, isn't it? Oh, wow. No one risking it for three points. For two points, let's see. Where are we? Oh, the plow. I think it's Easter Island, isn't it? You think it's Easter Island, and you're right. Let's look at the third picture just to... It's that hideous face that gives you. It's the hideous giant face that's in the way, yeah, exactly. There we go, there we go. Easter Island. So you won yourself two points there, the plough, well done. Let's look at our next one. Where are Sean and I? Oh, the mulberry tree. We've got a time to take a risk. We think it's the Blackpool Tower. We think it's the Blackpool Tower. You think it's the Blackpool Tower, and if you're right, that means you've got three points. Well, let's look at the next two pictures and see if you're right. It's the Blackpool Tower. Sean, let's have a look at the drastic changes on the scoreboard that that has given us. Great quizzing by the Mouldery Tree with a plough still lead, 5.3! 5.3, well done. Off the mark, no. Off the mark. Okay, it's time for the next round. It's the round we all came here for. It's time for Sean's nut. As you can see, Sean has a nuts board with categories on it. We've got UK history, cars, food and drink, birds, classical literature, 50s music, oceans and seas, film and tennis. In this round, the teams will pick a category and a question will be asked. First team to buzz in with the correct answer wins one point. Get the question wrong, though, and the other team can answer the same question for a point, okay? If you choose the category, though, you don't't own it it's open to both teams to play for Sean has hidden his nuts behind three categories on the board there are hidden nuts lurking if you can sniff them out their points will be doubled yes so the Moldbury tree you're behind but you get to pick first film can film so okay let's see if the nuts press ooh oh no press okay which 1981 film introduced dr henry walton jones junior as an archaeology professor yes the moldy jones and the radars of the lost art yeah well done Well, thank you. Well done. Dream work, making the dream work there. But we go over now to the plough. You're choosing a category. Films gone. You're the car expert, James. Try tennis. I'm happy with that. You're happy with that. Tennis, let's see if they need luck. Good luck. Ooh. All right. Oh, it's so satisfying. Okay. Who was the last British female winner of a tennis grand slam singles tournament winning Wimbledon in 1977 the Plough? Virginia Wade. It's the correct answer, Virginia Wade. Good point. The Marbury Tree. It's your turn to choose. I think oceans and seas would be a good one. Alright, okay. Ooh. Oh, no nuts. Gulfs of Gadsk, Riga and Finland are all located in which northern European sea? Yes, the Ploutic Sea. The Baltic Sea is correct. Well done, the Baltic. In 1987, 96% of the Baltic Sea. Baltic Sea is correct. Well done, the Baltic. In 1987, 96% of the Baltic Sea froze. Wow. Amazing. OK, the plow, you're choosing the category. I thought I'd give you that. I chose tennis, so. UK history. Yeah, UK history is going to. Ooh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Right. Which year of the 1990s did Queen Elizabeth II describe as her... Ennis, Horribitties? Yes.

Right, sheer lack of pressure situation for Mr May here. This isn't a tall bias. It isn't a tall bias. We were hoping you should have been... One of the categories is going to be Stephenage. Okay. Ever since 2014, which make and model has been the best-selling car in the UK. Two points on up, yes, the plough. I think it is still the golf. No. Let's have a think about this. I think it's a Prius. Yeah. Prius? Prius. Who makes Toyota Prius? You're wrong? It's the Ford Fiesta. Oh, think it's a Prius. Yeah. Prius? Who makes Toyota Prius? You're wrong? It's the Ford Fiesta.

Hello and welcome back to Al Murray's Great British Pub Quiz. The quiz that's never too shy to Elbert's way to the bar, and the first to get the round in. Right, Dave, I have a reason to believe that you have an impressive collection at home. What do you collect? Yeah, I'm a big fan of Star Wars, and I've got most of the original line-up. I've got probably about a thousand items, all in all. Wow. So it's probably not an item out there, which I haven't got. How old are you? 37. Yeah. So the plough from Battersea currently leading the mulberry tree from Stevenage, nine points to four but there's plenty more to play for so let's crack on with our next round. This is orders at the bar. Right, so in this round, the players become the answers and have to put themselves in order. You'll earn one point for each person who stood in the correct place. So there's a maximum of four points here, a minimum of none, if you get them all wrong, can't score three, you can get two or one. The mulberry tree, you're up first due to the fact you're trailing. So step down, please, and Sean will do the honours and transform our quizzes. That's all yours Andy. Thank you very much. You have to put this on, sir. Worry about those in a minute. I think they're straight forward, but that goes on and the stripes are the stripes. If you find a way to put that on, I think this... Well... You've got a natty little blue jacket there, Paul. Thanks. What? And this is yours, Rachel. Oh! You're doing in the hand. Al will explain, thank you. Right, only this is yours, Rachel. Oh. You're doing you in the hand. Al will explain, thank you. Right, only fools and horses. Yeah. Blackadder. Farty towels. Oh. Forty towers. And you're Heidi High. Oh, am I? And what I need you to do, Andy, is organise your team. Yeah. Put these British sitcoms into chronological order of when they first aired from earliest to most recent. It was safe and assuming that that Forty Towers was first, wasn't it? Before Heidi High? Yeah, I think so. Yeah? When did Heidi High first air? Heidi High, I reckon that's got to be early 80s at the very latest, but maybe late 70s. Yeah, it's going to be after that. Which one's the newest one going to be? The newest one, you can't all go that end. It's going to be between you and me for last, definitely. The first series was a long time ago, there was four series of last. When was the first series of horses? It wasn't very funny the first series, if one was. Yeah? So you'd like to come here and you'd like me here? Is that how you'd like it? Are you sure? I think so. Yeah? Well, Paul's happy with that. I'll just enjoy in this jacket. This suits you. This is the way our team would like to line up. Well, let's just see, so we. So Faulty Towers was from 1975, so it was the first of these sitcoms to air. And Heidi High aired in 1980. So it's the second of these sitcoms to air. And Heidi High aired in 1980. So it's the second of our sitcoms to air. And then only Fools and Horses was in 1981 and Blackadder in 1983. Oh, Neil. So you talked yourself. It was out of those four points there. It's grim watching that happen. Sean, you've got a ratings story, haven't you? Yeah, well, this is when, you know, way back in time, you know, there was only sort of four channels. Yeah. And it brought it home when Prince Harry got married, and the next day they got very excited about the viewing figures. But basically, what it bore down to was Prince Harry's wedding, 18 million viewers. Fat Barry's wedding, 20 million viewers! All right, okay, the plough, it's your turn, please step down and Sean will transform you. Certainly, certainly will. James, it's just a little skull cup there if you... Ideally if that could flat into one side of your head, that bit, so there you're... Flap and down one side of your head, thank you. Yeah I mean you trying to try to try to put away in here like you probably get this one right okay so James May you are the brain thank you're the heart kidneys Gerald Pierre you are the right lung. Okay, so what we have here is the right lung, both kidneys, a heart and a brain, and I need you to put these, James, please organise your team, these organs from an adult male human in order of average weight, lightest to heaviest. So I'd be the lightest, wouldn't I? I don't know, because your lungs last... No, no, no, kidneys, how many kidneys, don't you? Is it both kidneys or...? Both kidneys? Both kidneys. Gerald's kidney fascinator there. And I'm just the right lung. You're the right lung. When you eat a kidney, it's quite a dense... Not that I eat a human one, but... They're only... They're not......that's your panibal impression over there....theirreiber beans and......their sort of think we're possibly already correct. This is, I still think I'm the lightest. Okay. I mean, I don't know. I've never weighed any of my organs. So you're going kidneys, right lung, heart, brain. You. Well, you tell you what, you're right about the brain. You're right about the brain. You're right about the kidneys. Ah. But you've got the heart and, you write about the kidneys. But you've got the heart and the right lung in the wrong order, I'm afraid. So, because according to the US National Library of Medicine, kidneys are 266 grams, heart 331, right lung, 455 grams, and the brain, 1,407 grams. Two points. 1,407 grams. 2. 2 points. Well, they both got the same on that, but what's it done to the overall score, Sean? Not a lot. The play I'll still lead this time by 11.6. I hear it. I wish it was before again. Before I was skinned, boned and filleted. What happened that night? What are you going to do with all the love that's left over after someone's gone? I don't want to be mad.

In this round, I'll give each team a picture of a face made up from four different faces. The teams will have to first work out who the four faces are and then what connects them. You learn one point for identifying each face correctly and a bonus point for correctly guessing the link between the people. Now, maybe you see a couple of faces and you figure a link and you can work backwards from there, figure out who the other faces or faces are. So the mulberry tree, you can go first in this round. Here's your split face. Jeff Goldblum. You think Jeff Goldblum's top left? Yeah. So Jeff Goldblum, top left. Yeah. Who else? Here. You're going to need more than one, obviously, for the link, I think. Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be hard otherwise. People who were in the fly, you know, it's... You never know, it might be. Could be.

Tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to ask for four faces and a link now, please. Okay. Jeff Goldblum. Jeremy Irons. Yep. Freddie Mercury, I guess, then. Yeah. And the link being chemical elements. And then some guy called, I don't know. Something. So you're going chemical elements? Yeah. Well, let's see if you've got the faces right. So what we have here is Jeff Goldblum, David Copperfield. Oh, Jeremy Irons. Tindle. It is chemical elements. Well, it's metals, is what it is. Metals in their names. I can't give you chemical elements, so you've got two there. You got two. That was harsh. Jeremy Irons brought a 15th century castle in County Cork in Ireland, called Kilko Castle, and upset the locals by painting it pink. He did, he did. He said the colour had to match the green of the fields, the blue of the bay, the furnace of the sunset, and reflect the hotter chimes of Iberia, to which the kid who mixes the painting, the cork home bay said, I'll give it a goal with the stuff of the colour chart. The plough, your split face now. Who we got here? Robson Green. Oh, gosh. Top left. Ryan. Top top left. Ryan Cox, top right. Burning confidence. There's a priest.

Welcome back to Al Murray's Great British Pub Quiz. Currently the plow from Battersea is in the lead. 14-8. Ooh. Ooh. Now it's time for Sean to put his mouth where his brain is. This is, beat the Berman. Okay, so it's three points if you win. If you lose, nada, zip, diddley squite, zealch. I'll give you a category, and you take it in turns, to list things within that category. If time elapses or you give a wrong answer, it's all over, and your opponent is the winner, okay? Sean, are you ready for Beat the Barman? I am, I am, bring it on. Okay. Now, the Mulberry Tree, you're up first. As ever, neither Sean nor his opponent has any idea what the question will be. Your category for this round is UK geography. Off you go, Neil. It has been decided to be able. Apparently so. Wonderful. Neil, let's play Beat the Barman. Come on. Good luck. Good luck. Have a good one. Good luck. What I'd like you to do is take it in turns to name a river in the UK. By this, I mean, here's your clarification. A major river in the United Kingdom, according to the Britain Visitor website. So any river longer than 70 miles. Rivers that share a name will only be accepted once. Neil, as you're our guest, would you like to go first or second? I will go second. Okay. Let's see if you can beat the barman. Sean, you're up first. The Thames. River Seven. The Y. The Trent. The Tay. The Tyne. The Teyn. The T's. The River D. The river... The Great Ouse. Tamar. I'm afraid not. No. I'd like. So the air, the Avon, the Clyde, the Derwent, the Mersey, the Spay, the Witham, the Yur, the Medway, the Neen, the nith, the ribble. Well done, Neil. Tamar is 61 miles. Oh, come on. I don't make the rules up. So the plough, it's your turn to face, Sean. And his category is film. Oh, it's got to be you then, Gerald. Okay. Gerald, they seem to have decided pretty... We said Gerald film category yet. Okay, well, in which case, Gerald, do you like to step down please and play beat the ball and round and pull some... Good luck, Gerald! Good luck, Gerald. So Gerald, you're keen film fan because they've nominated you straight up. I like to think I am, but yeah, yeah. Your favourite kind of film? Like a sci-fi film. Okay. What I'd like you to do is take it in terms to name a Tom Cruise film. What we mean by this is any full-length feature film in which Tom Cruise is credited as a performer, according to IMDB. Tom Cruise fan, either of you, Gerald? 50-50. Yeah, sure we've boasted a few films? Hopefully we'll get... We'll have a little run at it. Okay. Give it a go. Gerald, as you're our guest, would you like to go first or second? I'll go first. You go first? Okay. Let's see it a go. Gerald, as you're our guest, would you like to go first or second? I'll go first. You go first, okay. Let's see if you can beat the barman. Here we go. Tom Cruise, Forbes. Let's go. Risky business. Mission impossible. Ghost protocol. Mission Impossible. Ghost Protocol, Mission Impossible. Cocktail. Cocktail. The Last Samurai. Jack Reacher. Jack Reacher, never go back. Days of Thunder. Eyes wide shut. Top gun. Time out, I'm afraid. I'd like you. You do good men, all the right moves. American made, Austin, powers, and gold member. He's in that. Yeah, collateral. Color of Money. Edge of Tomorrow. The Mummy. It's just been in that Mummy remake. Vanilla Sky, the firm, War of the Worlds, Rain Man, Rock of Ages, Taps. Jay McGuire. Jerry McGuire. There we go. Quite a few then. There we go. Well done to both. Well done. But he's tough to beat. Sean, what's that done to the scores? Going into the last round, the plowl still have a healthy lead. They're 14-8 up. Well, it's time for just one more round. This is Last Order. Right, this is the team's final opportunity to top up their points and to try and win the Great British Pub Quiz Tankard and a thousand pounds, yeah. This is our quick fire round where each correct answer is worth one point. You're up against the clock and it's on the buzzer until Sean calls time. Andy. Yes. I mean, when we first met the mulberry tree, they maybe were aiming low. To be honest, we're actually chuffed to pieces to have got eight points. There's loads of questions. We've got people digging in Cornwall at the moment, putting an extra nine miles on the tamer. So... I mean, Neil, you've got to just... You've just got to let that go, haven't you?
