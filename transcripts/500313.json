Through this twisting country, construction of a new road has been going on for some time. In the not too distant future, Gisbon will be solidly linked with inland centers. In the gorge, the work of blasting and clearing, blasting and clearing again, is bringing a new road out towards Gisner. But it's not only new highways that are being pushed along. Existing main roads all over the country are being widened and resurfaced. When operations are finished between Rotorua and Pocateani, the road will be 16 feet wider.

But we're moving with the time. The landscape's changing. We've mechanized the mountain and taken the drudgery out of climbing. And today, thousands of skiers come to Rorpeu to leave for a time the traffic and congestion of the city. To get away from the daily routine, the morning bus to catch, the parking space to find. Here they're free from the unexpected bumps and knocks of life in the town. They come to relax, leaving their chores behind them. Thousands of feet above the dull gray day of winter, it's holiday weather, so everybody settles down to work. A few sit first and figure out how to start.
