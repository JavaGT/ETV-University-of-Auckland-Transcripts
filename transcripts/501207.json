Oh, thank you so much for you. Oh, thank you so much for coming here today. Welcome to the show. Oh, we're going to have so much fun. I'm so excited. I think we should just get straight into it. Let's hit the desk and some headlines. It is time for Drew. the Madline. It is time for Drew's news, your gentle detangle of the good news comb. And with me at the desk, a man with a hair never out of place. Rossi Ross Matthew. That's right. I woke up like this. Hi. The second I read that, I thought that is true. Yeah, no, well, I'm a little bit of a mess when I wake up in the morning, like it's this going on. Oh, Ross, I bet you're perfect all day long. Okay, I'll let you think that. Thank you much. I know you and I do, actually. All right, well, we're so excited because we are celebrating beauty all week long. Yes, Yes. And from top to tail, we're serving up a whopping 100 beauty tips. So don't blink or you might miss one. In fact, I have a tip for you right now. Let's see. Okay, the next time you look at olive oil, look at it a little differently. It's fantastic for cuticles, and you can put it on your skin, your hand, you can astringent with a lemon and then moisturize with some olive oil, turn yourself into a human salad, trust me. Wow. It works. Huh, okay. I would worry that it would clog my pores, wouldn't you work? It doesn't. I use vitamin E oil, pure vitamin E oil on my skin all the time on my face. There's really nothing like it. It makes it so supple, fantastic. I just pictured myself tonight with olive oil over my hands, like dropping the remote, trying to... I'd like to see that. I have another hand tip though. You know how you SPF on your face to block the sun? Rub a little bit of that on your hands too. Because, you know, when someone's had a little bit of this, when you'll look at their hands, and it's like, oh, hi, grandma. You know what I'm talking about? Well, the makeovers continue today, and we're honoring a grandmother. And construction site manager from Los Angeles, California. Cheryl Bates, let's meet her. My name is Cheryl Bates, and I'm from Los Angeles, California. Cheryl Bates, let's meet her. My name is Cheryl Bates, and I'm from Los Angeles, California. I have two sons, and I have four grandkids that I love so much. I assist the rehabilitation of distressed properties throughout South Central Los Angeles and just change the whole neighborhood. Did you see me out in the field? You may not recognize me because I have a hard hat, still towed boots. I've been on ladders. I've carried doors. The jobs have to get done, and I'm not afraid. I'm a conservative dresser. I have several suits. My father always said that a woman should always have a good suit. My friends say, loosen up a little bit, show a little more cleavage, have something off the shoulder. Okay, so maybe they're right. I could use some help coming up with new ideas, new colors, something different. Can you help me? Aww. I have to say, I am in love with Cheryl and her best friend of 30 years, Veronica Love, is here to see her BFF's transformation. Hello, Veronica. Right here. Hi, Veronica. Hi, oh, hi, Veronica. Hi, girl. Well, my goodness, you're like a beauty style maven yourself. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, so do only like hot, fashionable people hang together? Is that the deal, you and your bestie? Well, not really. You know, Cheryl is very conservative. I've always tried to get her to switch it up some. I have not seen her with anything but that blonde hair. I can't even remember her hair wearing dark hair. So I'm just so glad that she had this opportunity in hopes that this makeover will transition her into adding more style into her life. We have a Drew Crew extraordinaire member, Brandis Daniel, and she is literally one of my favorite people. She has a company called Harlem Fashion Row. And Brandis is working her magic right now. And I'm telling you, I would put myself in her hands and I just love her and trust her and I can't wait to see what she does by the end of the show. The big reveal. All right, first let's hit those headlines. All right, let's start with some style news. Perfect dovetail. Some people are reaching again back into their closets and saying it's the 2000s, okay? And Vogue reports that this time they're whipping out the old popcorn top. It's a very stretchy top. It's like an accordion almost. Yeah. And a very high like squish factor. You can ball it up, throw it in a bag, stomp in it, then put it back on, and it's as good as new. I have one here. You've seen these, right? Where they're like this big. And what I always liked about it was that they're so hopeful. You know, they're like, yeah, but I could make it work. I could fit on you. Well, I'll take that challenge. Thank you very much. Let me. See, okay. Okay. She's a grower. Okay. Not a shower. This is... I mean... Wait. How? Wait. How? How did it? How'd you do that? Look at it. That's a... Wait, you know what? I feel like I have a whole new respect for these tops. You need a little help. Got it. Like, it does. It goes right back to it. All right, next we've got a senior high school tradition. I think you're going to love, Drew. Good News Network reports that at North Farmington High in Michigan, seniors dressed up in costume for their final ID photo in their high school career. So, and boy, they committed to these pictures, and we have some. Look, we have a Wayne and Garth. This is on their ID. Well, you remember that movie, tangled with the long hair? Like, there's one. I'm called it. Tangled. Then we have a classic Forrest Gump. And also an Alice in Wonderland, we have. Kio, I would do mine like Dorothy Spornack from Golden Girls. Yeah, remember Dorothy, B. Arthur. That's who I would want to do. We could do Sunny and Cher. We could do one together. Oh, I like that. Yeah. Who's Sunny, who's Cher? Well, stay tuned. Okay. Well, this story I also love as a cat owner, because it's about the latest in dating apps. If you're a cat-loving single on the prowl for the perfect date, uh-huh, there's an app for that. Really? Yes, Upworthy reports that tabby dates is the newest dating app designed just for cat people. And whether you have a cat yourself or you just love kitties, well that could get a little creepy. Yup. I feel like you should own a cat. But this app will get you a match. And plus you'll get deals on pet supplies and get invited to special cat events. Whoa. And if dogs are more your thing, guess what? Hop on over to dig dates. And that's a dating app for dog people. Mm-hmm. Rossi, not in, I said. Well, I don't know. I mean, I think, okay, good. I think it's cute. If you're like, I just worried that I'd be catfish. No, sorry, I said. Well, I don't know. I mean, I think, okay, good. I think it's cute. If you're like, I just worried that I'd be catfish. No, it's all right. I could even get that out. Would you go on, what was it called, Kitty Cat, Get It? What's it called? If we don't start a dating app called Kitty Cat Get It, Who in the heck is on Kitty Cat? Get it. We know what you're getting. We know. Some really weird fetishes. Oh my God. I don't know. I'm in.

We've got the answers to all your burning questions on Taskmaster. Wednesday on 2 and on demand. Welcome back to Drew's News. Okay, it's time to take the classic advice column and give it up to the old Drew's News spin. This is Ask a DeskSpot. Oh, no, let's do it again. Well, as we like to say here on the show, we are not experts, but we're desk-perts. If you're in a pickle, we would like to get involved. And today, in honor of beauty week, we're tackling your beauty questions. So, let's get started with our first question. Where's Yolanda? Here I am. Hi. Welcome to the show. Thank you. So how can we help you? I really do not know how to do my eyebrows, groom them. I really love some tips on how to do them. Oh. You got good brows too. Well, I went to the salon one time and they snatched off one and now I'm eyebrows shy. So you're gonna take your pencil and I like to draw in the brow of my choice. And you wanna fill in any holes, by the way, I gotta tweez, I can tell you that much. When you draw in, and this doesn't have to be even an everyday ritual, but if you're looking to tweez, draw the brow of your dreams with a very precision tip pencil, and then whatever hairs are falling outside that line, those are the ones you want to grab with a tweezer. And then once you tweez and you get that shape, I tend to love taking something that has a little bit of product and a little bit of a spoolie. Now a spoolie is going to just angle your hairs and it's going to give you a little bit of that moisture to move it around. And then you can sort of bush it out and you can either make a very specific line and you can arch it very smooth or you can jack it out and do something a little more, you know, jazzy. Thank you. Thank you. We need a difference, jazzy. Thank you. You really see the difference, so. Yeah. Then you just start teasing around that. I love it. You can see the difference. You can? Yeah, you can totally see it. Yeah. Really? A hundred percent. You should. Yeah. Do that every day. Do it every day, but also. Do you both? I was going to say, maybe you should do the other one too. All right. Guess what? It's your story, Ross, and you take it away. I'll work on the other side. She evens out her face. Our next question comes from Michelle, who's also in our audience. Where are you, Michelle? Right here. Hi. Welcome to the show. Thank you. You look, darling. Okay, how can we, it's time to ask a desperate, how can we help? I have a question about a jewelry trend. So I know pearls are a new trend that's happening right now. And I love wearing my pearls, but I wanna know, like, am I doing the trend right? Am I only wear it for special occasions? But I'd like to be able to do it all the time. Michelle, we actually have the perfect desperate here to answer this question for you. He actually rocked his pearls all the way to the World Series. Please welcome outfielder for the world champion, Atlanta Braves. Joff Peterson. Hi. Hi. How we doing? Jock Peterson. Hi. How we doing? Our expert, champion. That's right. Look, they're standing for you. Oh, it's so nice. Look at that. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. I have to tell you, thank you. I have to tell you, we are so thrilled that you are here. What gave you the idea to wear pearls? Where does the love come from? And what made you go for it? Yeah, great question. I don't know. I always thought they just kind of looked good. I saw Justin Bieber and Machine gun Kelly, I think, wear them to like the SPs or something. And I don't know, they're kind of on top of their style. So I reached out to my jeweler and wanted to change things up a little bit. And I think the white looks good with the jerseys, honestly, better than the gold chain and the black. So I just went for it. Shoot or shoot. What did your teammates think of the whole pearl look on the field? Yeah, they were making fun of me for sure, but it's all right. I thought they looked good and I think that's all that matters. And then I love that. I think they're probably pretty shocked when, I don't know, the Braves and Atlanta kind of took it by storm and everyone started wearing pearls. So then I think a couple guys asked me actually, they said, oh, you know, I actually, I kind of like that. Where do you get those from? I might get a set. Exactly. Look at a big mascot. That's great. Look at what you started. You even got Ross Matthews putting on a set. What do you think? There you go. I have to agree with Michelle, though. There are a lot of interpretations of the pearl. And I was just curious, do you have any advice for Michelle? Do you have a particular length or layering or simplicity? What is your desk spurt opinion? I've only done one. I got one and I try to keep it simple with that. But yours looks good. You have a lot going on there. And if you look good and you feel you look good, that's all that matters. Oh, come on. What a great... What a great pearl of wisdom. Thank you for that. Sounds good. Chuck Peterson, thank you so much. Okay, everybody. So cool. As we go to break, let's check out Cheryl and see how she's doing. Hey, things are going great up here. So Cheryl and I were just talking, and one of the tips that I was just giving her is that so often we only think about what we're wearing in terms of the clothing, but accessories, that is where it's at, okay? So these, Cheryl, I'm not going to tell you that these are what we might be wearing today, but accessories literally complete a look, and they are just as important as the clothing or the outfit that you're wearing. The other tip is so often we think in order to be sexy, you know, we need to show a little cleavage, or we think that we need, you know, an off-the-shoulder top, but sometimes you can just wear a really amazing maxi dress with a slit and you look just as sexy. So Cheryl, I hope you're ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I love her. I'm not going anywhere without you. True love. Woohoo! Comes with a price. I want sex just like her when we have kids. Get used to it, suck. You should be afraid. Shortland Street. Tonight at 7 on 2. With the last grand final spots up for grabs. Oh, panic. Nobody wants to be the last to 4. I'm feeling like that's it.

What a great guy. He's a great guy, yes. Not necessarily a great dancer. I haven't seen we have this much fun since I've ever. It's Casey Wilson and since it's Beauty Week on our show we thought we give her some special pampering in our makeup room and somebody really gets into doing her makeup. Check this out. Hi! Okay, by the way, you look so pretty already. I'm happy to be here. I heard that you went to a workout class and then across the street to the McDonald's, which I just have to say, like, this is why I know how much I love you. Okay, so 30 women and I did like a month long. You know where you're trying to commit to like a boot camp and to cleansing. Was this one of the ones in the book? Mm-hmm. Oh, my God, I haven't gotten to see you face to face. Your book made me the happiest. I've been in so many years. You don't stop. You're so sweet. I think it's one of the best books ever written. Stop. I'm not kidding. I'm not, and I'm a reader. Okay, so you were at the workout class. You were so sweet. I think it's one of the best books ever written. Stop. I'm not kidding. I'm not, and I'm a reader. Okay, so you were at the workout class. You were doing the boot camp. 30 women, we were feeling so good, and it was the end, and everyone's congratulating each other, and in a huddle, and a hug. And I just slipped right on out of that hug. And I got in my car, and I drove across the street to McDonald's. I got right in the drive-thru, and I got that vanilla cone. Oh, it's my favorite. Yeah, it's the greatest. And I maintain, you can really use that as a nice treat. So then all the women are just getting out of the class, and I drive by honking with my cone out the window. Did you say, I earned it? Yeah, but also I was, like, flicking them off. It's like, what did they do? I love that. I would understand that. They were astonished. Ooh, what's happening now? Don't be afraid. It's the scribble stick. It's like when my kids draw. It sort of looks like when you go to like a plastic surgeon and they're trying to suggest all the work you should get. Looking like a beautiful mind on the wall. Did you know that your nose like keeps growing your whole life? That makes a lot of sense because it's getting, it is twice the size. Things are getting out of hand with me and I appreciate your efforts here. So are your friends honest with you about like your hair, makeup, wardrobe? I feel like I heard something like they lack a filter a little bit. Sometimes they want more for me in the areas of fashion. And a girlfriend of mine, Jessica St. Clair, who's a wonderful actress. And she was very upset with me. And she had cancer, and then she finally got an amazingly clear scan. So we had a party for her. And I showed up late, and that doesn't feel good. And I was wearing a braid that had been done for me the night before, a very thick braid. Like a Heidi braid? Yeah. And it had fallen overnight, and she said it made her, to look at that braid, made her feel worse than what she'd been going through. And I was hard to hear. I said, I was not thinking about what you've been going through for you to have to look at this falling out braid on my head. And she said, I will accept that, but she can't forget it. And then she said for you to walk in late, and we all had to turn and see that. It was hard for her, you know. When and why did you start bitch sash? And how did you know that you and your friend would, like you're doing a town hall? You guys now fill up forums. So my partner, Daniel Schneider, and I just had my second baby, and we thought, let's do a podcast. It was six years ago. So we decided to talk about the real house eyes and we're just going to do six. We had so much fun, and the audience is so much fun. Okay, now I want you to talk like a ventriloquist. Okay, okay. So I love the house eyes, and our audience is so sweet and so hard. Again, you brought, like, an inherent sweetness. Like, you do. But I really do love them. It's not doing it just to make fun of them, all the idea. Maybe that's the difference. Oh. I don't know if you're going to like this tone, but if you don't, I'll change it. No, I do. Just so Just as alarming just for a second. Okay, now you can't talk again. Okay. Tell me if you're like a heart and heart. This tone, it might be. I really do. It's more tomato-y. Sometimes I feel like I usually see you in more of a carmine red, but I just loved this new product. I really do like this. Wow, okay, good. It's really beautiful. Now, when you wake up, what is your beauty routine? It's so minimal. I'm obsessive about sunscreen. My dermatologist, Christy Kidd, was telling me that anything you do on your face, you know any products that you know all the things you were doing on our faces that we're going to do all the way down to the nipple, but we're going to do on the earlobes. Did you know that? Yeah, we're doing it on the earlobes too. We can't ignore them. That's what I want to be a public service announcement and be an ambassador to that issue. We just got to keep them together. That's what I want to be a public service announcement and be an ambassador to that issue. We just got to keep them together. That's all I'm saying, and don't sleep in your earrings because it stretches them down. I would never sleep in my earrings. I'm going to say it. They're going to get a little roast beefy. Blah-la-la-la-la-la-la. Yeah, but we don't. Just tend to them. That's all. I know. Can you tell me a secret about the shrink next door, like filming it? I got to play Paul Red's wife, which was a dream. It's one of my favorite, like, Paul Red pieces I've ever seen. I know. He's amazing in it, and so as well. It's a dark comedy, and, like, a true crime, but they're so good in it. I am loving it so much. It's perfect. The four of you, like, any day, I'm really enjoying it. I can't wait to keep watching it. Oh, my God. Okay, wow, we've really... How do you feel? I feel good. Do you feel like it's light, it's attractive? I feel it's light and attractive. I love it. I love it. Thank you. Thank you, Casey.

And I am so anxious to see the final look. I really am. All right, well, it is Beauty Week here on the show, and it is a good day to have a good hair day. And we did a look back at the history of hair in this beauty backgrounder. Hair styling has been around long before the days of blow dryers, hair straighteners, shampoo, or conditioner. In fact, hair has become a form of identity with entire decades defined by iconic looks, or should we say, iconic locks. In the 20s, it was all about the Bob, popularized by Coco Chanel and Greta Garbo. Fingerwaves hit the scene in the 30s, followed by victory roles in the 40s. And we have to mention the flower power of Billy Holiday's iconic Gardinia. The 50s brought the pompadour, and who can forget, Twiggy's show's stopping Pixie from the 60s. This decade saw icons like Angela Davis and Diana Ross rock the Afro cementing this style as not just a hairdo, but a symbol of Black Pride during the Civil Rights Movement. Well, of course, there was also the 70s where Farah Fawcett's feathered dew was all the rage. The 80s brought some totally rad looks from side-high ponies and crimped hair, and then the 90s gave us some of the sought-after looks, such as the Rachel. The 2000s blessed us with Rihanna's braids and the many cuts of Kristen Stewart. Today, she's sporting a short blonde look, but Kristen continues to prove that there's no limit to what she can pull off. No matter what your own style is, one thing's for sure. Your hair is your canvas, so don't forget to play. Okay, joining us now is someone in the Wall Street Journal called The Hitmaker of Hollywood Hairdues. His clients include Kristen Stewart, Jennifer Garner, Reese Witherspoon, Rosario Dawson, just to name a few, please say hello to Adir Abragel. Wee! You have no idea. The work that I'm doing with Kristen Stewart today is so much due to so many references that I pull from work that you did. And I think you probably did your own hair and makeup some of these times, but it just was, I don't know, I think beauty is such a beautiful way to express yourself, and you did it in a beautiful way. And in the 90s, honestly, like, it is epic. My dear friend Justin Long, who I dated out and up for many years, I literally would say to him, I'd be like, can't you go and get a deer to cut your hair? Oh my God, I love it. I remember I used to literally, he always looked so handsome after getting his haircut with you. I love, love that man. He always looked his best after being a chair. I can't, thank you. Well, okay, before the show, you met one of our viewers, Julie, and she was thinking hair transformation. Love. Here's what she looked like before, which by the way is gorgeous. I'm into that, this look. Oh, yeah, oh, how awesome is this texture. Yeah, okay, well I can't wait to see what you did. Okay. A dear, take me through it. Let's go and do this. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ha-ha-ha. Okay. Turn around. Julie! Julie! Woohoo! So, immediately when I saw her, I thought, all right, let's take off some of this length. Let's give you more volume. Let's give you a little bit more highlights. And this was really great. One of the tips that I taught you today is when you're doing a center part, follow the bridge of your nose, and that's right where you have to have your middle parting. So that's super simple. And if you're going to do a side part, follow the arch of your brow. So that's where you go and you put a deep side part, right? So if I was going to change this, you guys, look at that. Immediately, you end up getting a really nice lift. I'm gonna show you the way that I get these really beautiful, simple waves. The secret is taking your iron, right? And all you're gonna really wanna do is just create this really easy movement back and forth, just like that, and that's going to give you that perfect, perfect lived-in wave. So that's a great tip. And then to really finish the look and get rid of a little bit of the frizz, you want to use an oil that isn't too heavy. This is virtue healing oil. It's really lightweight. It's super simple. I use a few drops like that. And then never apply it at the root area, only from your brows down. So if you tilt your hair, you just are going to take it. And I just want you to see the difference. So as I'm running it, look at what happens between this side and that side, right? So it's a really nice, it's a really nice, beautiful, easy trick. Again, tilt for me. And then you just run it. Don't put it near your roots. Your blowout will last a very long time. And then you just get this beautiful, gorgeous, shiny, sexy waves. I hope you're gonna try this at home. You are literally the vision and the creative director and the chemist and the brains behind virtue. Yes, thank you, thank you, you very. Oh my God, thank you so much. I mean, so good, right? How do you feel? Amazing. Perfect. Because that to me is everything with beauty. Oh my God, oh yeah. Thank you. And that's the, so good, right? How do you feel? Amazing. Perfect. Because that to me is everything with you. Oh my God, oh yeah. Thank you. And that's the thing, there is no right or wrong ever. There's so, honestly, there's so many great tips. Even when you're blow drying your hair as an example, right? And you're running, we're all busy, we don't have time. Blow dry only the top of your hair. Literally this section, do a V sectionsection, blow-dry that, let the rest air dry, and your hair will look incredible. Literally, like, maybe like two and a half minutes. It's that simple. Oh my gosh, dear, you are so amazing. All right, you use two tools, the flower hair tools, and the Ionic code dryer and the styling iron on Julie. And guess what? Everyone in the audience is gonna go home with both. Woo-hoo! The flower ionic pro- dryer and the styling iron. And now, thanks to you, we know what to do with that. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you so much. And Julie, you look forward. Just thank you, it's here. I would play. With the last grand final spots up for grabs. Oh, panic. Nobody wants to be the last to fall. I'm feeling like that's it. We're going home. We're going to miss out on the final. All new Lego Masters, New Zealand, tonight, 7.30 on 2. I think I've got some really good dates for you.

What will it take to him Master Chef this year? I think we all know the answer to that. The new season of Master's Year fans and faves starts Sunday, June 12th on 2 and on demand. All right, we've had some amazing makeovers this week. But have you ever heard of a money makeover? Yes. Well, we're teaming up with chime to learn how to get one. And here to share how you can get your finances to a beautiful place is our fund, money expert, and award-winning author. Melissa Leon! Welcome back to the show. Oh, thank you. This for me is such an important subject and I can't think of anyone better to discuss it with you. What is a money makeover, Melissa? Well, a money makeover is just a new approach or new strategy to refresh your finances. And I promise that a money makeover can drastically change the way that you feel about yourself and the look of your life. Okay, well, Melissa, you're going to poll the studio audience using our flower polls and figure out how to approach getting the best makeover and you're going to share some tips based on the responses. Okay, first question to our audience. Which common problem area causes you more stress lines, having too much debt or not having enough retirement savings? So hold up the red flower for debt and the green flower for retirement savings. Oh. What do you think, Drew? Is that a good mix, maybe? Kind of seems like a very even Steven. So what approach, if we do have a 50-50, do you suggest for both? So everybody gets something out of this. Well, listen, both of those issues are big issues. I hear you. And according to the Federal Reserve, only 36% of Americans actually feel like they're ready for retirement when it comes to their retirement savings. That's a low number. And so I get that when you are far from your goals, you think, oh, I'm so far. I'm not even going to try. But every little bit counts. Savings is a habit. You got to get into saving, even if it's just, say, 15% of your income or more depending on your age or your situation, and into various savings mechanisms like, you know, a savings account or maybe your 401k plan. You just want to make sure that you make that a habit. For everybody who said debt, I also understand, debt is one of the most stressful things that we can deal with. In a long list of stressful events, getting into debt beyond means of repayment ranks number five. Five, that's more stressful than your spouse cheating on you, more stressful than conflict with your boss. So one method to tackle that would be to list all of your debts and with their interest rates. And then while making the minimum payment on all of them, just pick one. Maybe the highest interest rate or maybe the smallest debt. And then attack it ferociously. Like throw whatever you can at it. And if you need to build credit, bringing down your credit balances can help your score improve over time. Also set a calendar reminder so that you are never late on a payment.

When it comes to your money, do you feel like you need a little financial touch-up or an all-over head-to-to-to-trospection, green flower for just a little touch-up and red flower for a total overhaul. Seems like a little bit more is in the green. A little mini makeovers, maybe refresh. Melissa, do you mind answering both questions? Just so again, everybody here gets something. So regardless of which makeover you're getting, the all over makeover or the mini refresh, you would start by, again, looking at your situation, get extreme clarity on the income and the expenses, your expenses. And so you are downloading your bank statements. You're looking at the inflow and outflow of your money. And you're also getting a sense of what your money habits have been. You know, ask yourself, what were the last three unplanned purchases that I made and why did I make them? And so I just think it's important to check in with yourself, to make sure that your spending is in line with your values and your goals. Okay, can you give us, like, one tip that we could all start doing today that might be a money-saving, planet-saving, just something we weren't thinking to do this way. Write down your goals, but they have to be specific. And so when I'm overwhelmed, I like to write things down. And so if you just write down three, you know, short term, midterm and long term goals, these goals like, I know, short term is sticking to your budget for the holidays, long term might be retirement, like decades out, and then break them up into mini bite-sized goals. So if you want to save $1,000 to add to your emergency fund, that's automating a transfer of $40 a week into a high-yield savings account. 40 bucks a week. I like that tip. Thank you, account. $40 a week. Save $40 a week. I like that. Thank you, Melissa, so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for making our lives better and more knowledgeable and less stressful, which does cause for a more beautiful life, a more beautiful feeling inside, and therefore a more relaxed, effortless outside. Thank you. We'll be right back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then, I'll do this out. If you can find an eye cream that actually has that peachy pigment, I like to dab it on. And then what I'll do is I'll wear this out. Instead of concealer, I will go around with this eye cream on. And do you see the dark circle has disappeared at least I would say 60, 70%. Now, I don't recommend putting makeup on top of IUCREME. It can curdle like cream in a hot tomato sauce and you don't want that. So this on its own not only acts as a concealer, brightening and lightening the effect and look of a dark circle, but it's also taming the dark circle while you're wearing it. It's sort of a perfect alchemy of skin care as makeup. And I love this. It's my tried and true run out, grab one, experiment with it, and tell me what you think. I love her.

I have been so busy backstage. Well, I cannot wait to see Cheryl with a brand new look, and Cheryl's a grandmother who wears a hard hat and a tool belt to work every day. And here in our audience, we met in the beginning of the show, Cheryl's best friend of 30 years, Veronica. All right, well, I have to say, I think that Cheryl has the most beautiful eyes, so I can't wait to see them in person. Come on out, Cheryl D. Whoa! Yes. You see it, right? You see it. She's feeling it. She is, here look. She is filling it. So you see we changed the hair, right? The hair looks amazing. And then, you know, Cheryl said that she likes conservative style. She wants to be conservative. So we didn't want to take her too far out of her comfort zone. However, we did give her this slit the show off those legs. And so what we did was we layered her look. So she came out with the blazer on. And then she has, this is actually a two piece. So she has on this two piece, which is a part of the Charles Harbison Banana Republic collaboration. And then we also wanted to give her, she says she doesn't wear high heels anymore, right, Cheryl? Right. So what we did was we gave her a booty, which is just a low flat heel. That is a great way to just take like your regular shoes, like to step it up a bit. And it's quite comfortable. Yes. And then with her face, what we wanted to do was just add more volume to her lashes and a pop of color on her lips and her eyes. And she just looks stunning. How do you feel? Like one of us. I feel. I don't want to cry. I feel beautiful. I feel excited. I feel different. Because everything is different. And so I'm excited. And I'm just honored. And every feeling that you can possibly think about, that's how I feel right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think that you look so stunning. Thank you. She looks absolutely beautiful. Veronica. How about your stylish best friend? What do you think? She looks beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brandes Daniel.
