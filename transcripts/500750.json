I'm Bernardine, Oliver Kirby. You're with A.M. Early. A controversial security pact between China and the Solomon Islands has been signed. China's foreign ministries confirmed that the two countries have agreed on the deal, which would pave the way for a Chinese naval base to be developed in the Pacific. The issue of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region is being discussed during the Prime Minister's trip to Singapore and Japan. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry says the deal will help maintain social order and safety in the island nation. A 22-year-old has died in Christchurch following a serious crash on Tuesday evening. Two motorcycles and a vehicle were involved in the accident shortly before 7 in Hornsville. A second person remains in Christchurch Hospital with serious injuries. State Highway 75 has reopened, but motorists are being warned of delays this morning. The Maritime Union is calling for more rules to be put in place after the death of a worker at the ports of Auckland. Emergency services were called to the port shortly after 9 on Tuesday, where Estabador is believed to have fallen to their death. It's the fourth fatal accident involving the port or its operations since 2017. Maritime Union National Secretary Craig Harrison told News Hub Live at 8, the government needs to set regulations like other industries. I think that's what's needed is some sort of regulatory overview or control that's put in place. Something like, for instance, you see in the trucking industry with truck drivers, hours of work and drive times. Harrison says an inquiry into port safety led by the government is required. Boris Johnson has been met with jeers and booze in his first appearance before the British Parliament since being fined for breaking lockdown rules. The Prime Minister has issued his second apology and asked the country for forgiveness following the infringement notice he received for attending an illegal function at Downing Street. He claims that he was unaware that a gathering in the cabinet room just before a meeting on COVID strategy was in breach of the rules. Despite this, he says, there was no excuse for his behaviour. I take this opportunity on the first available sitting day to repeat my wholehearted apology to the House. As soon as I receive the notice, I acknowledge the hurt and the anger. Johnson acknowledges that the British people deserve better from their Prime Minister. Pirey clashes have erupted along Ukraine's eastern border as Russia tries to take control of the Donbass region. President Vladimir Zelensky confirmed the battle was underway, saying that no matter how many Russian troops are brought in, Ukraine will not give up any of its land. Channel 7's Jeff Perry with the latest. President Zelensky told his country, the battle of Donbass has begun. It's a huge swathe of eastern Ukraine right against the Russian border, regions like Dernetsk and Lahansk, already controlled by Russian-based separatists, close to the battered city of Kharkiv, and includes Maripol, a symbol of human suffering in this war. Ukraine's military released these pictures to show its still defending Maripal, refusing to surrender the critical port city, even as its last remaining stronghold, the steel plant burns. Back here and Russian banks are the target of the next wave of sanctions brought in by our government. 18 financial institutes have been added to the sanctions list, making up 80% of Russia's total banking industry. Foreign Minister Nao Mahuta says the moves are designed to impose an economic and political cost and specifically target organisations that finance the continued invasion of Ukraine. With the video streaming market heating up, Netflix is expected to report its slowest quarterly revenue growth in nearly eight years. The digital content giant has gained just 2.6 million new subscribers in the first quarter of this year. That's well down on the pandemic peak of 9 million in the final three months of 2020. Competition from HBO Max, Amazon and Disney Plus has been blamed. Netflix is also likely about to lose a million subscribers due to its exit of the Russian market. It's hoping new seasons of popular titles, including Stranger Things and Ozark, could help turn things around. To Sport Now, and the new boss of the New Zealand Olympic Committee hasn't ruled out making a bid to host the Commonwealth Games. This year's Birmingham Games will be Nikki Nicholl's first event in charge of the NSOC. She admits there's a lot the needs to fall into place but says New Zealand could be in a position to host a major event in the future. It is expensive to run major events such as Commonwealth and Olympic Games and so we've got to find that right formula that brings the social and economic objectives as well as the sporting objectives. And so having the opportunity to do it across the country would be something we'd love. Footballing superstar Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Manchester United's Premier League clash at Liverpool this morning. Ronaldo and partner Georgina Rodriguez announced yesterday that one of their newborn twins had passed away. In a statement, United says that family is more important than anything, everything and Ronaldo is supporting his loved ones at this immensely difficult time. Fans will lead a minute's applause, which is to be held in the seventh minute of the match as a tribute to Ronaldo and his family. Let's take a look at the weather around the country now. Tomorrow's weather brought to by nature. Turned to power by Meridian. No real surprise. There are some heavy rain watches across the country this morning to be aware of orange heavy rain mornings in Tasman, Westland and Fjordland, with high rainfall expected, along with thunderstorms and large amounts of surface water. Heavy rain watch is in place for Canterbury-Otago Lakes regions. A heavy rain watch also set for parts of Bulla and Westland. Expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms. To the rest of the country, the Lower South can expect a cloudy day with showers developing in the afternoon. Dunedin on 20 degrees, Oamaru, a high of 18. To the west coast, heavy rain for periods, with light north-easter leaves developing in the afternoon, Milford's arm 19-hawker tick at 20 degrees. Canterbury and Marlborough can expect some morning and evening cloud with possible showers in the afternoon. Christchurch on 23 degrees, while Blenham, a hive 24. Some morning cloud in the lower north too, with Northe, northe, with northeastery winds developing. Wellington, a high, 21 degrees today. Marston, much warmer on 25. To the central plateau, cloudy periods with showers developing later in the day. Taupor, 20 degrees, Fonganui, 27. To the east coast, expect a high cloud coverage day. Add to that, a northeasterly breeze, scattered showers, bit of everything. Tauranga 22, Rotorua, a hive 19 today. And to the top of Atira, be ready for clouds, some showers in the morning, possibly heavy, they though are expected to ease by the afternoon. Tamaki Makoto, Auckland and Kain Thai, both with a hive 24 degrees today. After the break, there was a boost in trading over Easter but businesses out of the woods yet. Plus, the Maritime Union says a lack of safety standards is contributing to a high rate of accidents and deaths at New Zealand's ports. We discuss what changes are needed next time on A.N.

Prime Minister Jacinda Adern's first offshore trip since the COVID pandemic hit is being welcomed by many, with her tour of Japan and Singapore dubbed a trade mission. The government is focusing on maintaining and deepening trade connections. And to discuss this, I'm joined by Infometrics Principal economist Brad Olson. Good morning to you, Brad. Good morning. 781 days since the PM embarked on a trip overseas like this. How key, how critical is a trip like this? This trip by the Prime Minister is absolutely huge. We know that we need to get out there, put New Zealand back on the map, not only in terms of people thinking about our response to the pandemic, but importantly, that element that we're open for business, we're looking forward to welcoming people back to New Zealand, but also that we've got some incredible trade opportunities coming through. And one thing that we know quite clearly, particularly in Asia, is that those personal relationships, those connections, are very, very critical to getting things moving. Trade sounds very transactional, but getting things across the line does require a lot more of those connections, and that's what we're seeing at the moment. And remembering that, you know, Japan and Singapore, our fourth and fifth largest trading partners, so these are very important already to our economy. We're looking to go even further, and we know that everyone else is starting to do the same thing. Australia recently signed a trade deal with India. We've seen the UK Foreign Secretary in recent days announce a roadmap with Indonesia. So the fact that we're getting out there at a time when everyone else is also important to make sure that we keep very firmly at the forefront of those trading ideas and trading options as we start to reopen to the world. It's worth about $15 billion in two-way trade, Japan and Singapore. of those trading ideas and trading options as we start to reopen to the world. It's worth about $15 billion in two-way trade, Japan and Singapore. And you kind of allude it might be a bit of a slow burn. That might not be a bad thing. Are we ready to take offshore visitors? Is New Zealand ready for it? I think it is going to take a while for everything to ramp up. Certainly our expectations, both around tourism and migration, are back here to New Zealand, isn't that we just click our fingers and things are back towards normal. But the fact that we're getting out there, the fact that we're getting New Zealand back on the forefront of these countries' minds that we're starting to have these conversations is important because there is sort of a long runway for a lot of this work. And again, the fact that this is the first trip for the Prime Minister and CROP in quite a while, the fact that there is a full business delegation there, the fact that the media are there and reporting on what's going on both locally and internationally. Again, just lists that profile of New Zealand after a period of, you know, we've been talked about both here and internationally about a hermit kingdom. Now we're very much trying to open back up. And putting someone like the Prime Minister who has that very strong international star power out there is important for lifting our brand for raising that awareness of Al-Therra. All right. Well, back home, Brad, recent trading over Easter showed a small boost in the back pockets of business owners. But was it enough to signal the economy is turning a corner that does that shift happening? Look, we're totally not fixed yet. We're not ready to sort of declare victory quite so soon. But the reports coming out from Easter trading are certainly encouraging and do offer, I guess, a glimmer of hope around business opportunities there. I've seen reports from the likes of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Nelson, Queensland, all showing some of the best trading activity that some businesses are reporting almost of the entire pandemic period. And so it's really encouraging to see that move into Orange is starting to encourage more people to get out and about. We know there's still some real shortages around labour and materials. I was at one cafe where they said they'd normally have 12 staff on. They could only find four over the Easter weekend, so it's still challenging. Business is not out of the woods yet, but certainly that feeling that, hey, people are more willing to go out and about. There's still a bit of optimism out there as we shift down those alert levels. Yeah, and I think we've got another long weekend, endzac weekend, school holidays. But Kiwi households are downbeat about the future. Well, that's what the numbers would say, petrol food prices. Are we likely to be in a holding pattern until inflation eases in that respect? There's definitely, in my mind, that sort of balance on either side. I don't think, well, there's no chance in my mind that we go immediately back to normal on the spending. We've got those much higher interest rates. We've got very high inflation. Households are at their most downbeat in history on one survey since 2004. So that feeling there is that households are going to have to cut back on their spending. But at the same time, we are moving to a new normal. We're starting to see some greater freedoms. People are wanting to enjoy those as much as possible. So you might see a bit of pent-up demand, but I think the fact that you're seeing that level of activity from people out into local businesses is just an encouraging sign that we're not completely down and out. There's still momentum left in the economic motor. We're not back at full speed, but we're also starting to at least get a little bit more of a roll on. Sounds good, sounds positive. Infometrics, principal economist, Brian Olson. To international news now, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has entered into a new chapter with a key eastern city captured by the Russian aggressors. This comes as the battle for the Donbass region continues to roar on. To tell us more, I'm joined by AIM Europe reporter Fiona Connor. Good morning to you, Fiona. This hasn't led up at all. What's the latest from the Donbass area? Good morning, Bernardin. Russian forces have seized the small city of Kremlin in the eastern part of Ukraine. This is a city with about 18,000 people, and it's located about 500 kilometres away from Kiev in the eastern region. This is all part of Russia's new plan to take over that Dombas region. In that Dombas region, we've already got Dinesk and Lohansk, and these are two areas that are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists and fighting's gone on there since 2014. And so you can kind of see what Putin's wanting to do. They've seized Crimea in the south, and they're focusing on Miripol in that eastern region, essentially trying to create a land corridor, if you will. In Maripold, you know, those soldiers have come under, those Ukrainian soldiers have come under a really tough time. Some of them were held up into an steelworks. They were given two hours to put down their guns and to surrender and told that no harm would come from them. But that steelworks was later attacked by the Russians, so we're still learning what's actually the impact of that attack. But Zelensky, you know, he has said that no matter how many troops are driven to the east, they will fight and they will defend themselves, but it is looking like it's getting harder and harder for them. Yeah, and I know Britain has resolved to further support that defensive effort. Speaking of the British PM, Boris broke the lockdown rules, didn't he? He's been fine, but now he's going to be judged by his MPs. Yeah, that's right. On Thursday, MPs will vote as to whether a parliamentary investigation should be held into Boris's, you know, his move in terms of whether or not he misledged the public intentionally during those breaches that took place over lockdown. He, of course, is adamant that he did not intentionally break the rules. He did not intentionally mislead the public. But then we've got Labour leader, Keistama, who is really calling for this investigation to go ahead. And it's tough for the Brits to sort of continue to see it play out. I think there are so many other issues that are so important, like what's going on in Ukraine, like the rising power prices. So I think there's a bit of a feeling here. You know, the police have ordered Boris Johnson to pay. He's paid his fine. The Sugrae inquiry deemed that those investigations should not have taken place. We've kind of, we kind of know all these things now. And, you know, I think the continual focus on them is taking away from other matters. Because if this investigation does go ahead, then it's going to get dragged up everything all over again. There's evidence. They can have witnesses, you know, be called in this investigation. And it will sort of just drag out this whole lockdown breach, which people were upset about. But where we sort of draw the line on that anger and, you know, sort of punishing Boris Johnson for that, I think is mixed opinions here at the moment. Yeah, you've got to wonder about priorities and timing, don't you? Prince Harry can't help himself. He's booked another sit-down interview with American media. This can't end well, can it? I know. The royal family must be absolutely bracing themselves for what is to come next after Prince Harry sat down with Coda Hobbit, Hobtib, sorry, and had this interview in the Netherlands. You know, all eyes are always on Prince Harry and in Megan Markle as to what they did. Certainly the tabloids here were really focusing on every move that they made, you know, from their interactions with one another to what Megan Markle was wearing. She was sort of criticized quite publicly here for wearing, you know, 38,000 pounds, almost 80,000 New Zealand dollars worth of outfits of over three days. You know, she doesn't seem to always be able to put a foot right. But, you know, this new interview is only sort of probably going to, you know, concern and put the fear into the royal family. So fresh off the back of Prince Harry and Megan Markle seeing the queen in that private setting. So, you know, what Prince Harry then does with that interaction and what he shares about it is going to be very interesting to see. And we don't have to wait that long because in a few hours there's going to be a preview for that. And within 24 hours, it's going to be out there. So I'm sure everyone is going to be waiting and watching. That will be going global, that's for sure. AM, Europe reporter Fiona Connor.

Norma, Hokiemiya, you with AIM early as 5 to 6. Time now to check in with our reporters around the country, and it's Morena to Tia McDougal. Tia are not great news for Aucklanders north of Auckland, waking up if they're wanting to make the connection to the city this morning. No, no. Disastrous start for residents of Gulf Harbour and Fungaparrawa who usually take the ferry from Gulf Harbour into the CBD. All ferry services have been cancelled. Northeasterlies are supposed to hit the Auckland region in about 30 kilometres an hour, which is supposed to be disastrous along the shoreline. Now, Fuller, the company that puts on the ferry services, have put on replacement buses. Just know that the travel time for those buses is a lot longer than the ferry time, so if you will be taking those buses, try not to be late for work. Oh dear, maybe pack the air pods or a book to read on the trip down. Thanks for that to you. Let's now say good morning to Mitch Redmond in Christchurch Otahe. Mitch, shadow on the park, it's iconic and it's up for sale. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. And it was also one of the main facilities in Christchurch throughout the pandemic for those MIQ travellers that were coming through. Now, like you said, Hilton's Shato on the park, it has hit the market, and which for the past two years has been largely unused by the public, with it being set aside for just those coming in from overseas. It is in a prime location right across the road from Hagley Park, in this sought-after suburb of Fendleton, so it is quite likely that this listing will attract plenty of attention. There are almost 200 rooms at the facility with seven conference rooms and plenty of outdoor space as well. So in years gone by it has been super popular with sports teams, the likes of the wallabies, international cricket teams and the England netball team too that all came here during their pandemic and had their stay at the chateau on the park. The hotel last sold in 2006 for the very cool sum of $26 million. It's now expected to hit $40 million when it hits the market once again in the next few weeks. So to anybody that may have that type of money lying around, perhaps this could be your next big purchase. Wow, it is a beautiful spot, no doubt about it. We might see some high-rise buildings, apartments going up. You never know, do you? Thanks for that team. Tia and Mitch are reporters around the country. That was AM early. It is three minutes to six."}
