From the old and new world sailors followed the whale migration to the lonely sounds and inlets of Marlborough. Cloudy Bay became the most famous whaling rendezvous in the world and with ships flying flags of all nations anchored there one of the most lawless places on the globe. This activity lasted a few short years but some of the whalers established a shore-based station in nearby Torrey Channel. The station, one of the world's oldest, has been in continuous operation for 140 years. It's mainly the sperm whale that is now hunted by Marlborough whalers. When one sounds it can stay often for two and a half hours before coming up for air and back to danger.

Twice a day ferries cross the strait, linking the North Islands road and railhead at Wellington with Picton in the south. The Scow Echo still carries on a tradition of a twice weekly service across the strait to Blenham. At high tide, slowly feeling her way, Echo eases over the Wairau bar where sand and shingle have trapped many a vessel. River trade in Marlborough started in the late 1840s when the first vessel crossed the bar bringing supplies to squatters in the Wairau and when the first vessel crossed the bar bringing supplies to squatters in the Wairau and Awerderi valleys. This little vessel which has tramped to and from Wellington since 1918 has also sailed the wide Pacific doing war service with the United States Navy.

Kikora has always been a rich source of seafood to the MƒÅori and was the site of one of the greatest battles in Maori history when Tirupraha fought for the possession of this valuable peninsula.

Between twin ranges sprawls the high country of Molesworth Cattle Station. In winter snow covered and completely isolated. Sealed off throughout the long winter, Molesworth thaws out and light aircraft come in to help with the spring muster. The job of combing this huge area of mountain, river and plane to muster in all the cattle takes up to five weeks, even with the help of aircraft.

With poisoned carrots dropped from the air the hungry rabbits were at last controlled, and Molesworth, grazing cattle now, has made a successful comeback. But sheep have always been the sustaining wealth of Marlborough, whether run on hill country or fine flatland. The district's prosperity is firmly based on sheep. Sealers came with the whalers. They quickly killed off the large seal colonies around the Kikura Peninsula and left with their cargoes of fur and oil. Seals are protected now and each year the population multiplies on the same ancient haunts. They're left in peace to feed on the enemies of crayfish, squid and octopus. Seabirds too find refuge when they come back each year to their breeding grounds on the rocky Kikura coast.
