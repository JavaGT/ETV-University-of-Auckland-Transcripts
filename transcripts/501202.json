Welcome in to breakfast on this Tuesday, the 31st May. Last day of May. God, where has the year gone? Crazy. Absolutely crazy. Thank you for your company this morning. Coming up on the show, destroying the duopoly, will the government's supermarket regulation fix rising costs at the checkout? That is coming up just after 7 o'clock this morning. Plus, Labour and Nationalist split in the latest Kantan political poll. We'll have that and all you need to know in your news. One News political editor is going to be joining us just before 7 o'clock to take a look at those numbers in a little bit more depth. But also, China's pursuit and the Pacific continues. But is it something we should be concerned about here in Aotearoa? We're going to take a huge look at this, a deep dive into that this morning for you. And what it actually means for us here in Aalue. Right now, though it's just gone 6 o'clock, so here is Indira with your news. At the latest one news canter poll has revealed an even split in party support. National has the most support with 39% and Labor down 2% to 35. Even with the Act Party 7%, National would still fall short of a majority of seats in Parliament, as would Labor and the Green Party. The projection would leave the Party MƒÅori holding the balance of power. And it's over across the Tasman, it's looking likely Anthony Albanese will be able to form a majority government in Australia. Three electorates are still to be called in the federal election, but projections have Albanese's Labour Party winning the inner-city Melbourne seat of McNamara. That would get Labour to the magic number of 76 seats. That's enough for a majority in the Federal House of Representatives. And back here in Aoteiro, time could be running out for Aontheiro's supermarket duopoly as the government reveals its plan to crack down on the sector. The Commerce Minister has released a response to the Commerce Commission study, accepting 12 of the 14 recommendations and digging deeper on the other two. Supermarkets will be forced to allow rivals access to groceries at a reasonable price with regular competition checks. A bill will be introduced to Parliament later this year to promote change. And migrants will play a key role in Al Thero's future productivity and workforce. A new report out this morning has detailed recommendations on immigration and addressing skilled worker shortages. The Productivity Commission's Ganesh Nana says migrants make a positive contribution to New Zealand's economy and community. New Zealand is a country. You've always experienced outward flows of New Zealanders, so we need some migrants to come back and, I suppose, fill the gap there, but also to contribute even further in terms of connecting us to other parts of the world, bringing in innovations, new technologies, connecting us to our trade partners, different businesses. It's just another way of ensuring that New Zealand is connected to the rest of the world. And Immigration Minister Chris Farfoy has welcomed the findings on Al-Teroa's immigration settings. And China has failed to convince a number of Pacific Islands to sign a region-wide security deal. China's foreign minister Wang Yi and his counterparts from 10 Pacific Island nations held a high-level meeting in Fiji yesterday, but we're unable to come to a consensus. The superpower is seeking a wide-ranging deal that covered free trade, police cooperation and disaster resilience. Wang Yi is continuing his tour of the region today and is set to visit Donga. And Russian forces have entered the city of Sivrodonetsk as they continue their attempts to capture the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine. The strategic city has seen fierce fighting in recent days. Authorities say 90% of buildings have been damaged and they have, quote, given up counting casualties. U.S. President Joe Biden has clarified reports that his administration was planning to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine. Are you going to send long-rage rocket systems to Ukraine. Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine? We're not going to send the Ukraine rocket systems that can striking the Russia. And European Union leaders are divided over a proposed ban of Russian oil imports. Leaders have met in Brussels to discuss the ban, but the talks are largely being held up by Hungary. The country relies heavily on Russian gas and is the main opponent of the ban. If leaders manage to come to a compromise, it would be the EU's six package of sanctions to hit Russia. And in sports news, the blackcaps have confirmed their 15-man squad ahead of this week's first test against England. Henry Nichols is in doubt for the match still recovering from a carpentry with Michael Bracewell in as cover. And Trent Bolt has been named in the squad but is unlikely to feature having only just arrived in London following the IPL final. We've been through this before with different players, so I guess it's not something that's new to us, and we'll deal with that tomorrow probably and work out what's best for us going forward with Trent Bold in particular. The first test starts on Thursday at Lords. And 19-year-old Holger Rune has put the French open on notice after an upset win over World Number 4, Stefano Sitzipas, for a place in the quarterfinals. Rune won the first set before dropping the second but held his nerve to take the next two to win in four sets. The teenager becomes a first Danish man to reach the quarter finals of the tournament. It's the biggest win of Holger-un's life. It's taken until day nine, but we finally have an upset. And Kiwi player Erin Routless Rowland-Garros campaign has come to an end after losing her third round doubles match in three sets. And finally, not for the faint-hearted. A glass-bottomed bridge in Vietnam has been anointed the world's longest by the Guinness Book of Records. The Bark Long Bridge is 632 metres long, breaking the previous best held by a bridge in China by 100 metres. It's suspended nearly 150 metres above the jungle. The glass walkway can hold up to 450 people. The bridge opened in Vietnam's northwestern Sonla province in April. Wow. I wouldn't do it. No thanks for me. Anyway, take a look at your weather this morning. Here's how your day is going to look. We're starting to the upper north some... Oh, just gives me the hippie-jeebies. Some showers in Auckland today this morning and also that will be developing later on in the afternoon for the rest of you. Kaitaya, heavier falls for you. 20 degrees is your high. It's still fairly warmly and 21 is a high in Fingardi. And heading south, we've got showers this morning here, easing for the afternoon. 19 degrees is a high for Hamilton and Pakatane. That cloud will be hanging about, but at least the rain will clear. And crossing to the east coast, you've got some cloud this morning, and that will clear for pretty good afternoon. 18 degrees, there's a high in Danubeck, 21 in Napier and Hastings. There's some good news to look forward to after yesterday's rain. Now to the West Coast. Here it's cloudy for everybody with showers this morning, and those showers will ease and clear out later on in the afternoon. 17 degrees is the high for Wellington. Further south, it is fine for Kai Khaura, but a wet day for the rest of you with some heavier falls from Westport all the way down to Hokitika beautiful day in Kaikoda 21 degrees is your high and to the east you've got a nice fine day for you with some high cloud this morning 20 degrees is a high in Christchurch and Ashburton beautiful 19 in Timuru. And to the bottom of the country, the deep south, Queenstown and Milford Sound. It's a cloudy start for the rest of you. Milford Sound, though, you've got that heavy rain. Heavier this morning, easing later on this afternoon, 16 degrees as you're high. But from Dunedin all the way down, the sun will be out. 19 degrees is high in Dunedin. Thanks, Indira. A little bit later on in the show, actually, just after 8 o'clock, we're going to be doing an interview about vaping. And the rise in, especially teenagers, vaping, about almost 10% of teenagers now are vaping, apparently. It's quite horrifying to me. It's horrifying on a level of the fact that we actually don't know exactly. I mean, we do know what's in vaping. There are no long-term studies done to say what the impacts are of vaping and the fact that it is so widespread. And that's the thing, because it started as the thing to encourage people to move away from smoking cigarettes. Yeah, it's a safe away. Fantastic. But now it's become a thing where it's very cool. There's these really delicious flavors. If I walk past a vaping store, and there's so many of them around our biggest cities at the moment, they're really cool, they look amazing. Flashing light. Flashing light. I have mistaken the smell of vaping for perfume. Yes. It got in thinking, oh, I don't mind the smell. I don't mind that. I remember my daughter saying someone asking, oh, can I just charge my vape stick on your laptop? I was like, you can do that? Yep. You just put there like a USB bed. It's crazy. It is a huge issue for schools as well because, you know, they're coping with exactly that. Students are taking them to school. They are charging them in classrooms. They are vaping in classrooms. And actually, one of our questions today is around whether you're concerned about the rise in vaping with our teenagers. But actually, I'm also interested in schools and how your school is actually dealing with the up the rise in vaping with our teenagers. But actually, I'm also interested in schools in how your school is actually dealing with the uptick in vaping with our teenagers. Well, it used to be, you know, you had to go around the back of the bike shed. You go to bike shed and, you know, light up, have a puff. But now it's a lot more accessible, and it doesn't necessarily give off the same odour so people don't necessarily know that you're doing it in class. The other part of it too is actually the, I mean, you know, with smoking, you used to do the smoke rings and you'd, you know, you try different things. Well that is a big part of vaping as well, the different tricks that you can do. You jump on TikTok, there they are, showing you how to do them. So yeah, it's bigger. Feels like same stuff in a different form, isn't it? Exactly. So just after 8 o'clock, we'll be speaking to a pediatrician as well as Tim O'Connor from Auckland Grammar School about how their school is dealing with it. He's calling it a pandemic. Yeah. Yeah. But we'd love to hear from you. Are you concerned about the rise in vaping, especially amongst our teens? And like Jenny Mae said, if you're a school or involved in a school, how is your school coping and dealing with the rise in teenagers vaping? Let us know, breakfast at tvnZ.co.n.z.combe.

Welcome back to breakfast in its quarter past six. We're a step closer to making groceries more affordable, with the government announcing a new watchdog to review competition in the supermarket sector annually. That's more often than the Commerce Commission recommended, with the government also deciding to force the two major players to supply smaller rival retailers with wholesale access to groceries, something the Commission had suggested be voluntary. A mandatory code of conduct, compulsory unit pricing on groceries and more transparent loyalty schemes are among the other 12 recommendations the government has accepted. The supermarket duopoly in New Zealand, it's hot news at the moment as the government cracks down on our two major retailers. But the food cost crisis has got Kiwi's thinking about another major issue, food waste, and what it means for our environment. Out shopping recently, you may have been unpleasantly surprised when it's come to the final tally. New Zealand's currently seeing record high prices, with inflation hitting 6.9%. And the problem isn't going away. Things are really expensive right now, like super expensive, ridiculously expensive. According to Statistics New Zealand's latest figures, grocery prices have risen even further in the past month. And that's on top of the jump we saw from April last year to this year. Some supermarkets are putting price freezers on select staples like bread and milk. But it remains to be seen how much of a difference this will make to costs. The issue of high prices is prompting some to think more about the amount of food they're wasting. And we're wasting a lot. In New Zealand, coming out of our homes, we waste 157,000 tons of food waste per year. That's enough to feed Dunedin for three years. Well, I cook at home and I try to buy more frequently rather than buying in bulk. We are conscious that the price of food is going up and we don't want to waste food because it is expensive. It actually breaks my heart when I waste food at home, so I try really hard not to. So how can we cut down on our food waste? Well, the experts suggest taking any leftovers to a food rescue organization and brushing up on our food waste. Well, the experts suggest taking any leftovers to a food rescue organization and brushing up on our food knowledge. Cooking seasonally with a wider range of ingredients can help to cut costs. The savings are knowing how to cook food from all around the planet and then tapping into whatever's available at the cheapest price when you see it. They're also urging Kiwis to get out of the habit of a weekly food shop. Shop for three days, don't shop for seven. I don't know anyone who knows what they're going to cook for all seven days. It's on us to ensure we're getting the most out of our supermarket shop before food ends up here. Lucy Anderson, One News. And thanks to our talented colleague Lucy Anderson from the TVNZ Digital Fano for that brilliant piece. Also, you can get even more on the food waste issue on our website and at One News on Instagram. Actually, food waste is, I mean, we know that it's a big issue. And I'm wondering about how you actually deal with it in your far. Indira and I were just talking about the fact that we compost, right? Yeah. So put all your food waste in one basket and, you know, all your disposables that go to the tip in another. But yeah, that's essentially how we're ‚Äì I'd love to have a little pig. Oh, I know. I didn't even know you're going to head to that, but that would be pretty cool. Yeah. And some of the stuff, if you are growing a garden, like banana skins, fish bones are good for the garden too, like apparently amazing for growing tomatoes. So we try and throw stuff on the garden. But I'm always thinking about methane gas if you're putting food in your rubbish. It actually increases. I mean, that's great, though, but I live in an inner city apartment. So what am I meant to do? And I am embarrassed at the amount of food waste. Because you know, you go to the supermarket with the best of intentions for your week ahead, and then things get in the way, your work late or something comes up, and then all of a sudden you've got all this food that you haven't cooked with, that's gone off, you know, fruit and veggies especially, and what do you do with it? Yeah, well, what do you do with it? We'd love to hear from me, breakfast at tvnz.nz.com.com. We've had some amazing tomatoes grow out of our... Yeah, amazing. We're also already getting some incredible feedback about vaping. We're doing an interview just after 8 o'clock this morning about the rise, especially in teenagers who have taken up vaping. Bailey says vaping was a tool I used to successfully quit smoking nearly two years ago. I slowly transitioned from 50 mills to zero mills and then eventually gave up vaping altogether once I fell pregnant. I've been vape free for nearly 10 months now, which is fantastic. Wow. And was the purpose of vaping, but that's not what it's become, especially for a lot of our young people who see it as a really cool thing to do. There's these great flavors you can buy. And as you mentioned, Jenny Mae, with social media, there's all these tricks you can do with vaping and things like that. But also, we know that our teenage is a big part of their lives at this point in time, is about fitting in, right? And so if everybody's doing it, you know, then in order to fit in, and this is one of the things that some of their friends are doing. Actually, thank you for whoever sent this in. We asked how your school is actually dealing with the increase in vaping within schools. And this person wrote in anonymously, fair enough, and said that she works in an intermediate school in Auckland and can confirm that they are finding it hard in terms of vaping and the increase of it, but actually it's getting younger. It's not just our older teens, so, you know, I'm assuming in an intermediate, you're talking about 11, 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds. Kids are doing it in the bathrooms to get away with it. Often it smells like sickly, sweet deodorant, so it's hard to detect. And I personally have been, yeah, blindsided by that, thinking that that's what it was. But actually, yeah. And I also think, you know, a very, very long time ago when people used to smoke indoors and think that that's normal, you're seeing people vape indoors. I literally had someone in my house who pulled out a vaping. And I was like, excuse me, like, oh, sorry, I just totally forgot. I realized they must normally just vape indoors. I literally had someone in my house who pulled out of vaping. I was like, excuse me. I'm like, oh, sorry, I just totally forgot. I realized they must normally just vape it. Just do it inside. Yeah, I know. I could imagine you go, excuse me? Yeah. What is that? She knows. Anyway, keep the feedback coming in. We're loving hearing from it, especially if you've got some solutions for how you've addressed it, possibly in your own household with your teenagers. Breakfast at TVNZ.com.n.z. All right. Actually, we'll be right back. Yeah, with me and that is. Then we'll take a broader look at China's interest in the Pacific. Is it a security threat, as some say or are? We all overreacting.

Now, before we get to your news and weather with Endera, big ups for your feedback that's coming through, not only on vaping, two subjects this morning, around vaping and also on food wastage. Kaila Shah, excess fruit and veggies from our garden is donated to the local PƒÅaka. So many of you probably have these in your communities where it's just like a cupboard or a shelf that's left somewhere on the side of the road which people donate and just give food to... I love a neighbourhood pataka. Yeah, we've got one in Piyopio through on the main street. The problem is, is because it's on the main street, a lot of people who are driving through who aren't necessarily community members will just take a lot of it, rather than just take a few of the lemons or whatever that's been placed there. And I think the principle behind a Pantakaas take what you need, give what you can. Give what you can, totally. I'm just reading about how much of an issue food waste in this country is. There's an organisation called Love Food, Hate Waste. And I've estimated that New Zealand homes throw away 157,000 tonnes of food per year, all of which could have been eaten. This is enough food to feed the whole of Dunedin for just under three years. It's pretty convicting, isn't it? Crazy. Also, a lot of your feedback coming in around... What you do with your food waste. Yeah, what you do with it, where you put it. But also around vaping. This is Kelly, in the town of Waipokuro, Central Hawks Bay, a second vape shop has just opened, you know, saying that it is bizarre, but actually it's not in one way, given the rise in popularity of vaping. We're talking specifically around your teenagers. We're having a conversation, or Maddie's having that conversation just after 8 o'clock this morning. This is really interesting. Someone has emailed in one of our viewers to say, my daughter, who's 14, managed to order vapes online to sell to her classmates. It was picked up by the dairy owner who sorts out our rural mail. From a shop in Hamilton, she was able to order these vapes who accepted, the shop did, accepted ticking a box to declare you are over 18 with no other checks in place. So the 14 year old daughter ticked the box, said, yep, I'm over 18, ordered in the vapes, and then was on selling them to her class So easy. So, I mean, you know, also, like, that's quite honest, to be fair, to the 14-year-old. But it also kind of takes you back to a time when, you know, I think younger people did that with cigarettes, maybe as it legislation that is needing to catch up. Yeah, absolutely. And I guess it's possibly just even easier to do now because, you know, once upon a time you were to ask an older person to go into a dairy and buy them for you, but now you can just do it all online and you don't even need the second person. Melissa, I think we should just let people enjoy what they want before that is taken away from them too. Yeah, I mean, that's one way of looking at it, Melissa, but, you know, you're thinking about, you're talking about teenagers here. So, you know, as parents, that's our job, is to try and help them make the best decisions that they possibly can. The new researcher is suggesting about 10% of teenagers in this country vape daily, daily. And I guess it's just that concern of what is it doing to them? We don't know enough, as you said, Jenny May, about the long-term effects of vaping. And maybe we shouldn't be worried that much about it, but it's just the unknown. Heather is concerned about the local dairy's now starting to sell vapes, presumably though they're not selling them to young people. They're selling them to adults in your community. It doesn't mean to say that they just can't get their hands on it. And there's some other way or form. Yes. I've never heard of a vape club. Nigel is talking about a vape club, and apparently vape shop owners target vape clubs because they're people that are willing to smoke. Nigel says people that vape to quit smoking aren't of any use to them. They go to the vape clubs. Wow. This is interesting. Anyway, this whole conversation is interesting, and we appreciate your thoughts on this. Breakfast at TdnZ.com.com. It's 630. Here's in Dera with your news. At the Maria. The conditions on the countdown is on, sorry, for fairer prices at the checkout as the government reveals its plan to crack down on the supermarket duopoly. The Commerce Minister has released a response to the Commerce Commission study, accepting 12 of the 14 recommendations and digging deeper on the other two. Supermarkets will no longer be able to buy up land in order to stop competitors setting up nearby, mandatory code of conducts, unit pricing on groceries and more transparency around loyalty schemes will also be introduced. And migrants will play a key role in Altheiro's future productivity and workforce. A new report out this morning has detailed recommendations on immigration and addressing skilled worker shortages. The Productivity Commission's Ganesh Nana says long-term immigration policies are some of the core recommendations from the report. In the end, it's about long-term settings for those connections. I would think the immigration policy announcements have still focused on the short-term considerations. It's those long-term considerations about building our capacity and building our ability to use the skills that migrants bring in with them. Immigration Minister Chris Faafoy has welcomed the report. And China's foreign minister Wang Yi is continuing his tour of the Pacific region today, set to visit Donga. It comes after he was unable to convince a number of Pacific Islands to sign a region-wide security deal yesterday. Wang Yi and his counterparts from 10 Pacific Island nations held a high-level meeting in Fiji, but we're unable to come to a consensus. The superpower is seeking a wide-ranging deal that covers free trade, police cooperation and disaster resilience. And 21 bodies have been recovered from the crash site of a plane in northern Nepal. 22 people were inside the aircraft. Rescue efforts are continuing to find the missing passenger. The plane was on a 20-minute flight when it lost contact with air traffic control, five minutes before it was supposed to land. And now in sports and England are preparing for a dog fight against the black caps when the first cricket test starting on Thursday. England's new coach, Brenda McCollum, has assembled his side to take on New Zealand and England have only won one match and lost 11 of their last 17 tests and currently sit last on the World Test Championship standings. We know that we're in for an absolute dog fight to be honest with you because that's exactly what they do each and every time and yeah it's always a great series when we play against them. And it's always an enjoyable series played in the right way. And that's always tough. It's what you want to be playing in it. It's fantastic. And the Central Pulse have toppled the Northern Mystics on the Domestic Netball Premiership table. A pulse shooters Tiana Mituaro and Alia Dunn, both shooting over 80% to help their side pass the mainland tactics 51-43 and claim top spot on goal difference. We know that Home Grand Final is on the line and we really want that. We really want that for ourselves and we really want that for our fans. So, yeah, one more game to go. The Pulse and the Mystics face off at a top of the table clash on Friday. And taking a look at your weather this morning. It's a better forecast than it was yesterday. We're starting here in the Upper North. As you can see, we've got showers here in Tamaki, Makota this morning and those showers will come about for everybody else later on in the upper north. As you can see, we've got showers here in Tamaki, Makota, this morning, and those showers will come about for everybody else later on in the afternoon, a little bit heavier for you in Kaitai. 21 degrees is the warm high in Fingare. And heading south, showers this morning, but it's going to get better. They will ease for the afternoon for just a cloudy day later on, and 19 degrees is the highest temp, oh no, Tauranga, sorry, you are peaking at 20 degrees, and then 19 degrees for Fakataane and Kiri Hiroa Hamilton. And crossing to the East Coast. You've got some lovely cloud this morning, and then it gets even better. I mean, I think you can afford just to step out in a cardigan today, take off the layers and have a t-shirt underneath afterwards. I mean, it's going to be crisp, but a blue, clear skies kind of day later on for you in your afternoon. Beautiful, 21 degrees, the high in Napier and Hastings. And to the west side, cloudy here for everybody. You do have a few showers through here as well this morning. As you can see from Taumaranoi, everybody except for Fonganui actually showers this morning. That will clear for almost everybody later on. Libin, you are peaking at 19 degrees today, Fomanoi at 20 degrees. And further south, it's a wet day for everybody, except for Kaikoda, who's just going to have a beautiful time, a 21 degrees, is the high for a lovely sunny day. And to the east, it's a nice fine day for you. You've got some high cloud this morning. 20 degrees is a high for Crushish and in Ashburton. It's going to be pretty fine later on today. 19 degrees a high in Timuru and Oamaru, 17 in Alexandra. And to the deep south, the bottom of the country. Rain for Queensland and Milford Sound. Cloudy start for everybody else, which will clear, for a beautiful day later on. 19 degrees to high in Dunedin. Thanks, Indira. We're returning our attention back to the Pacific now, where China's presence has come into focus over the past few days following Chinese foreign Wang Yi's tour of the Pacific. The tour has seen China enter into an agreement promising greater cooperation with Samoa. It's also hoping for a sweeping regional economic and security accord. So should we be concerned here in New Zealand? We're joined by intelligence and policy analyst Paul Buchanan. Back to Breakfast. Thank you so much for joining us, Paul. We really appreciate your time, as we always do. Morena, mani. Thanks for having me back. It's been a while. It has, and we so appreciate it, especially at the moment, because it feels like everyone's kind of tiptoeing around this, you know, wondering whether this is going to be turning into anything. How concerned should we be, do you think, by China's presence in the Pacific? Okay, well, let's set this stage. What you have here is the potential to redraw the geopolitical map and change the security architecture of the Southwest Pacific. This is a bold move by the Chinese, and it's a two-level game. On the one hand, they're forging ahead with bilateral relationships, such as that with the Salamans and now with Samoa. They're going to work on a similar deal with Tonga. And then they're going for a comprehensive regional agreement, which they did not achieve yesterday, but this is the first of many attempts. And what we have to put, the context is this. China has been working on these relationships, using its soft power in the Pacific for over two decades. In the meantime, traditional Western patrons, I hate to say it, but neo-colonial patrons, have neglected the Pacific in some measure, not entirely, but in some measure, depending on the larger geopolitical factors. So the Chinese have taken advantage of this. And I guess the question for us is, is the greater Chinese presence in the South Pacific a benign or a malign influence? A lot of Western officials in Canberra, Washington, and Wellington will tell you that China's presence here will lead to more conflict, the militarization of the region, and is therefore a malign development. The Chinese will tell you that they have no history of imperialism in the Pacific. They have great relations with the Pacific Island Forum and that all we're seeing is, again, Western neo-colonial eubris in the face of a new pretender to the throne. I'll leave it for others to decide whether it's entirely malign or entirely benign, but that's where we are. I remember when we saw that leaked a memorandum of understanding with the Solomon Islands back in March, and it suggested that China could look to deploy forces to the islands if need be. Do you think we would have seen something similar with the agreement that's been reached with Samoa as well? It's on the cards. It definitely is on the cards. But let me just put a reality check here we have to remember that australia and new zealand have put police forces and troops into the pacific on repeated occasions but apparently that's good now the chinese what they want to do is put police trainers in the solomons and they have a clause now in that agreement where if their investments are threatened in the solomons and the chinese are the biggest investors in the Solomon's, and they have a clause now in that agreement, where if their investments are threatened in the Solomon's and Chinese are the biggest investors in the Solomon's, then they can send security forces to protect those assets. If that occurs in Samoa, where there is a large Chinese expat population, then undoubtedly there will be a lot of concern in Wellington, Canberra, and Washington, D.C., but they're doing nothing different than Western nations have done repeatedly in the past. So in the end, it's a value call. We don't like Chinese values because they're authoritarian, and they don't play by international norms and rules. I'll be very blunt about it. That's what this is about. Otherwise, if they played by Western rules, there'd be none of these concerns. But because the concern here is that China simply will lie, cheat, and steal its way to great power prominence, we have to oppose them. And is there a slight difference in the, is there a slight difference in the in the in the is there a slight imbalance in terms of power between our our our forces and China's armed forces in terms of would China potentially pose a greater risk globally if they had some sort of armed forces hold in the Pacific? Well that's not going to happen right right away. What they've secured agreement with is port visits for replenishing in the Solomon's, and they'll probably get that in Samoa. They already have such an agreement with Fiji, and you know what? We have Chinese warships and intelligence specials come to New Zealand to do exactly the same thing. So that in and of itself is not a problem. Forward basing of Chinese naval assets in the South Pacific. Now, that's a problem. That will lead to conflict undoubtedly because they'll be straddling the sea lanes of communication. I mean, you know, the scenarios then multiply into bad news. But go ahead. Go ahead. I was just going to say, sorry, Paul, explain to our view as what that would involve and what that would look like. Well, when you do foreign basing agreements, and the Chinese only have one major one, and that's in Djibouti, what happens is the land is leased out, the land around the port, let's say, is leased out to the buying foreign power. They come in, they develop the infrastructure, they dredge out the ports so large gray-hulled ships can go in there. And they use it for 50 years, 99 years, and possibly renewable thereafter. The thing is, they may start with a hospital ship, and they may wind up forward porting an aircraft carrier. Let's put it this way. The United States forward ports aircraft carriers on the island of Okinawa, which remains as a war trophy from World War II. So you project power a lot better if you can get forward basing rights around the world. And China is on the way to becoming a great power. So they're doing what they have to do. The question here is, can any limits be placed on the extent to which they can forward base their ships? For example, they can't put in ships like aircraft carriers. I mean, I don't know how that exactly would be worked out, but that would be a regional issue. That would be for the Pacific Island Forum to discuss with the Chinese. The worked out, but that would be a regional issue. That would be for the Pacific Island Forum to discuss with the Chinese. The fact is, is that no matter whether we like it or not, the status quo in the South Pacific is changed forever. The Chinese are not going away. And the question now is how do we respond, not just reactively, which is what's going on in Wellington and Canberra now, but proactively. So just quickly before we go, Paul, how should we be responding? What should we be doing? The main thing is to engage our Pacific Island partners on the issue of values and transparency. See, the Chinese are pushing developmental aid with no strings attached. They don't care the nature of local governance. You can be as corrupt as you want. The West has traditionally tied conditions to the provision of aid. I still think we need to tie conditions related to honesty and that sort of thing. There has to be a more frank discussion between the Pacific Island community and New Zealand and Australia. And let's leave it at this. New Zealand is not Australia. We know this, but a lot of other people think that we just follow the Australians along. This is a time to carve a different path from the Aussies, because the Aussies are very bullying, and we're actually persuasive. So that's what I would recommend. Paul, we so appreciate your insight as we always do. And it's nice to see you back on breakfast. Thank you for coming on, especially at this time of the morning as well. That's Paul Buchanan, Intelligence and Policy Analyst for us. Right, coming up, destroying the duopoly. Will the government's regulation fix Altero's supermarket problems?

The post-budget sweeteners haven't given Labor an energy boost in the polls. That's according to the latest One News Kantar Public Poll. So let's take a look at the numbers and see how they compare with the last poll in March. National steady on 39. Labor is on 35, dropping two. The Greens are up slightly on 10 and act down slightly on 7. While the MƒÅori party, while it stay steady on 2. Now, let's look at some of the parties that aren't in Parliament. The Opportunities Party is on 2. Yeah, and New Zealand First and new Conservative get one each. Now let's look at the preferred Prime Minister numbers. Jacinda Ardern is in the lead on 33, down one from March and there's no change for national leader Christopher Luxon. He's steady on 25. David Seymour has dipped and now sits on 3%. Green MP, Chloe Swarbrick, isn't even a party leader, but she is sitting on two. And Winston Peters is still registering. He's sitting on one for more analysis on what this all means. We're joined by our political editor, Jessica Much McCai. Morena, Jess. Wow, those numbers were they surprising at all for you? Post-budget, I guess, for Labor in particular. I think what was interesting is we didn't see the numbers shifting around a lot. Labor lost a little bit, which I think is reasonably surprising when you're spending billions of dollars and giving Middle New Zealand 350 bucks. Because this poll was taken between the 21st and 25th of May. So it's Saturday after the budget until Thursday last week. So it took into account the budget. It took into account the Prime Minister's trip to the US. And she does well on that stage. So I think they would have expected to see a little bit more of a boost. I think what's interesting is when I was digging into the numbers, Labor doesn't always get those budget boosts, but I think when they were spending that much money and really trying to target that middle income who's struggling with the cost of living, they would have expected a little bit more support. And perhaps that $350 sweetener for people they thought might have helped in some way, although, I mean, is it reasonable to say, well, actually, that hasn't sunk in quite yet, and the Prime Minister's trip to the US hasn't quite sunk in for voters' trips? Perhaps, and that's something that definitely the Prime Minister's office are arguing. But quite a lot of the polling has done on that Sunday, which gives people a couple of days to digest things. I mean, when you break all of this down, what you can take away from it is that things are very, very tight at the moment and that neither party can actually form a government with its traditional partners. So you could either have the MƒÅori party and the kingmaker position with Acta National. Very unlikely they could work with Act and probably not with National either. Or they could cause a hung parliament, which would mean that we'd have to go back to the poll. Yeah, which I found really interesting. One you spoke to Rawari Waititi yesterday after those results came out, what was his take on where the Maori Party currently sits and which way they could potentially go? Well, I think he's relishing the power position. And, you know, I think that's really important. That means that he can get gains for the things that he thinks are important. But I also think that he made a really good point, that they do well in the cross benches. I think probably, like perhaps New Zealand First and Winston Peters, they feel comfortable in those opposition benches. They feel like they can do a lot by putting up their ideas and putting up alternatives. One scenario you could see is that National and Act could form a minority government they could be the ministers and the MƒÅori could agree to support them on important things in the House but nestle in a few of their big things as well. So I think that the MƒÅori Party will be feeling in a very strong flexing position at the moment. What's National's response to those numbers? Well, I think National's trying to play the, let's just see, let's just see, let's just see what happens, card. I don't think Kiwis like the idea of a three-headed monster. We've been here before, and I think that it was complex. So I think National will be hoping that they can firm up the numbers to get across the line with just act and not have to rely on a third party. David Seymour in terms of Prime Minister down quite a bit. So how do you think he'll be feeling about that? Well, look, I think David Seymour and Act had such a big chunk of support. And I think it's probably now going to slightly more realistic proposition. Seven's still a very strong number, especially a year out from an election for a smaller party. I think he'll be feeling a bit disappointed that he's not quite getting those lofty heights that he was before when National was struggling, but I think he can still feel reasonably chaffed that he's solidified that group. Do you think he'll come out banging the drums, though, trying to get more of that support back? Absolutely. And it's there. If he can push the right buttons, it's there for him. But he probably would be taking it off national. And if there are a block, you know, obviously he'd bring more power into it. But it is really interesting seeing those numbers, I guess, steady out a little bit. I have to wrap things out. But I am interested in Chloe Swalbert, appearing on preferred prime minister. But also, what's our fascination, continued fascination, with Winston Fenthalis. Well, you know very well, I saw your last interview with him. He's just a character that we turn to for leadership. Really quickly, Chloe Swarbrick, she resonates with a lot of people, she's got name recognition. One point I'll make that I thought was really interesting is we ask people, who'd you like to be Prime Minister, and the answer back is whoever you name so it's not prompted and in this poll grant robertson the finance minister national's finance spokesperson came up um rawhati wauiti the co-leader of the maori and james shaw all they're not registering 1% so they don't make it onto your graphic there but they're all registering registering and i think what that shows is that they all have had a good couple of weeks with the budget, and they're now showing up in those preferred Prime Minister numbers. So it is, when you scurry around and dig into the numbers, like I quite like to do, you can see some interesting little snippets in there as well. Very interesting. Just as much, McLeer, as always.

Strong yet fragrant and infused with Bergamot. Welcome back to Breakfast. Before we get to Endera and your 7 o'clock news this morning, Matt Gibb is down in Wind Whistle, which I'm trying to think where that even is. What are you doing, Matt? Where are you? More than Atta-Mari, at the moment I'm just, if you want to know what I'm doing, I'm reliving the jacuzzi that I had last night. It was, ah, chef's kiss. Perfect. Let me get out of here though I'll show you where we are wind whistle is correct actually we're celebrating our brand new partnership with the core live limitless we're going around a few of their amazing hotels this week and showing them off to you and here we are it's a bit of a change of pace from yesterday when we're in oaklin's CBD at the so hotel right in the heart of downtown tamaki makoto this morning wind whistle it's just outside of christ christch it's about 20 minutes north of Methven. And Ryan is the general manager of this beautiful property. It's the Fable Terrace Downs Resort by M Gallery. What an amazing place you get to call home, Ryan. Yeah, morning, how you going? Such a great place. So you manage this place, you live on site? Yep, yeah, live on site. What's it like? What's the story of this place, do you reckon? Well, I guess the beauty of what we've got here, and sadly there's no dance parties, but we get a whole range of activities here and we cater for everyone. So, archery, claybird shooting, jet boating, fly fishing, hunting, romance, you name it, we cater for it. Oh, and weddings too, we do them. Sensational. And, as an avid golfer, I believe there's a little bit of a golf course out there. There's a little one out there. We might see that later. So there's an 18-hole championship golf course here. It's obviously an alpine scenery, so it does make it very beautiful as well. I honestly can't wait to show you the view that we are going to have just out there, the Southern Alps. It just looks absolutely stunning picturesque. A little bit of snow, a dusting of snow at the moment? Yeah, a little bit. We had it last Friday, so yeah, it's still a bit around. Look, it's going to be huge. This is such a beautiful place. Accor Live Limitless. There's such a great partner. And in celebration of this new partnership, we've got an incredible competition that you are wanting to get in the drill for this morning. All you have to do is head to the breakfast Facebook page. Click on the competition link, and you could be winning for yourself. Flights over to Sydney. You'll get three nights accommodation at the Sofetel, Sydney, Darling Harbour, right in the middle of downtown Sydney. You'll get breakfast included every day.

Should we head down there and grab a coffee and get set for the golf? I think so. Let's go. Excellent. We'll see shortly. We'll catch up with you a little bit later on. Thank you so much, Matt. Nisayandra, here is your 7 o'clock news. Time could be running out for Al Thero's supermarket duopoly after the government revealed its plan to open up the sector. The Commerce Minister has accepted 12 of the 14 recommendations from the Commerce Commission and gone further on the other two. Supermarkets will be forced to allow rivals access to groceries at a reasonable price with regular competition checks. A bill will be introduced to Parliament later this year to promote change. Intelligence and policy analyst Paul Buchanan says Al-Teroa needs to have frank discussions with the Pacific as China's influence in the region grows. China has failed to convince a number of Pacific Islands to sign a region-wide security deal. Wong-Yi and his counterparts from 10 Pacific Island nations held a high-level meeting in Fiji yesterday, but we're unable to come to a consensus. There has to be a more frank discussion between the Pacific Island community and New Zealand and Australia, and let's leave it at this. New Zealand is not Australia. We know this, but a lot of other people think that we just follow the Australians along. This is a time to carve a different path from the Aussies, because the Aussies are very bullying, and we're actually persuasive. Wang Yi will continue his tour of the region today and is set to visit Donga. Meanwhile, across a Tasman, it's looking likely Anthony Albanese will be able to form a majority government in Australia. Three electorates are still to be called in the federal election, but projections have Albanese's Labour Party winning the inner-city Melbourne seat of McNamara. That would get labour to the magic number of 76 seats, which is enough for a majority in the Federal House of Representatives. And further overseas, Russian forces have entered the city of Sivrodonytsk, despite strong resistance from Ukrainian troops. The city is a key target for Russia in its efforts to capture the eastern Luhansk region. Ukraine says 90% of the city's buildings have been damaged. It comes as the European Union struggles to reach an agreement on new sanctions on Russia. And in sport, 19-year-old Holger Rune has caused an upset at the French Open, knocking out world number four Stefano Sitsip Pass for a place in the quarterfinals. Rune won the first set before dropping the second, but held his nerve to take the next two to win in four sets. The teenager becomes the first Danish man to reach the quarterfinals of the tournament. It's the biggest win of Holger-un's life. It's taken until day nine, but we finally have an upset. That is so awesome. I really actually quite love the story. Rune is set to play eighth seed Caspar Rudd in the quarterfinals. I have an unbelievable feeling right now. I mean, I was so nervous at the end, but the crowd was amazing for me, the whole match, the whole tournament. So I'm so grateful. I'm so happy to be playing on this course. You guys are amazing. Gorgeous. And Women's World No. 1, Egas Sweetek, overcame a shaky start to advance to the quarterfinals, beating her Chinese opponent in three sets. And taking a look at your weather this morning. Here's how your day is going to turn out for you. Al-Teroa, starting at the top, the upper north. Auckland, you're starting off with some showers this morning, and that's going to develop later in the afternoon for everybody else. Kite Paya, definitely, packing umbrella. If you're heading out the door this morning, those showers are going to hit you later in the afternoon. 20 degrees is your high. Heading south at showers this morning as well. Those showers will ease later on for a pretty fine afternoon. Just cloud hanging about, 19 degrees is a high for Hamilton and Pakatani. And crossing to the East Coast, it's a cloudy morning, but it's going to clear for a beautiful day. 21 degrees, the high in Hastings. And to the west, cloudy for everybody through here with showers this morning. That will ease this afternoon. But the cloud's still hanging about 17 degrees, for everybody through here with showers this morning. That will ease this afternoon. The cloud's still hanging about 17 degrees of high in Tefanganoia part of the capital, Wellington, with some showers later on in the afternoon as well. Further south, everybody here is going to get a wet day except for Kaikoda. The sun is shining down in Kaikoda, 221 degrees, this beautiful morning and afternoon, even though just below, Westport all the way down to Hockey Chika is going to see heavy falls all morning. 17 degrees to the high. We sport all the way down to Hockey Tekekeke. And to the east coast, it's a lovely fine day for everybody. We've got starting off with some lovely cloud, but that's going to clear for a blue skies clear afternoon, 20 degrees is high in Christ Street, and Ashburton into the deep south, bottom of the country. Rain for Queenstown and Milford Sound, heavier falls for you this morning, as you can see. Dunedin all the way down to Rakiota Stewart Island. Howdy this morning, but that's going to end up being a beautiful day later on. Have a great day, El Therra. Thanks, Indira. It's seven minutes past seven. As you've seen in the news, there might be finally some changes on the way to the way supermarkets do business in Altero. For years, they've been accused of charging far too much for groceries, and now the government plans tougher rules to make sure New Zealanders get a fair deal. To talk about what that looks like, we're joined by Competition Law Specialist Andy Gleney, and in Wellington, Consumer New Zealanders get a fair deal. To talk about what that looks like, we're joined by Competition Law Specialist Andy Gleney, and in Wellington, Consumer New Zealand's Gemma Rasmussen. Thank you so much for joining us, both of you. Andy, will come to you shortly. But, Gemma, I want to just start with you because this is something that you've been pushing for for a long time at Consumer New Zealand. Why is that? What are you most concerned about? We feel like New Zealanders have been paying far too high prices at the checkout, and that's really been due to a lack of competition. The Geopoly have really enjoyed New Zealanders not being able to shop anywhere else, and they've been able to charge quite high prices, we think. So this really comes as a great move. We put out a petition, 78,000 people said they wanted the Commerce Commission's recommendations to go further. So there absolutely was support for this move. Yeah. And so tell us about that petition that you presented to Parliament. What was it that you were calling for or hoping for? We really feel like the basis for good competition in New Zealand is centred around wholesale. So right now the supermarkets, they completely control the wholesale sector. And so that means that if you are an existing player like the warehouse or a new entrant trying to get in, it's really hard to actually guarantee food on your shelves, on the aisles. And if you can't get that, then it's really hard to flourish. So we think if new players can get access to wholesale, then that's going to be the answer. So we really wanted the government to regulate wholesale. And that's what Minister Clark has come out and recommended. So we're really pleased with that. Yeah Andy welcoming you from our Auckland studio this is big stuff right and it's unwinding a long-standing system that we have here in New Zealand it takes time it's complicated yeah it is so we've had this duopoly in place for almost a couple of decades now I think the really tricky piece for what we're going to be doing in the next year or two is trying to get that wholesale access right. So as Jamis says, that's really what will make a difference. If we can get a little bit more competition at that level of the market, then over time we'll see some really positive results coming through for consumers. So what do you make of Minister Clark's recommendations or the fact that he's accepted these Commerce Commission recommendations and actually gone further, especially around the wholesale access? I think that's really telling that he's gone beyond what the Commission was recommending. The Commission has made some really sensible recommendations. They've accepted those. And then he said, well, we need to actually do something in addition to that. The really tricky thing, though, that he's going to have to give some real thought to is how he's going to set that wholesale access regime up. So that's going to take some real care. This isn't a straightforward industry if you think about fuel, you know, like petrol is petrol and it's not particularly different from one place to another. But if you think about the huge range of things that you can get off the supermarket shelves, trying to regulate the wholesale price for toothpaste and broccoli and so on. You know, that could be really challenging. Because it's constantly changing? Yeah, for a start, there's a huge range of them. But as you say, there's dynamism, meaning that it changes from day to day, probably hour to hour, depending on which market you're in. But there's a whole range of different things that someone is going to have to keep an eye on. Now, I think that's probably why he hasn't rushed ahead and said, this is what I'm going to do. This is what the regime's going to look like, because he's going to have to take some time in order to figure out how it will work. Jimmy, how concerned are you about that? You know, obviously, Minister Clark has come up very strongly in terms of embracing these recommendations and regulations. But are you concerned that actually this is a really difficult thing to actually implement? I mean, I think that the big concern is that New Zealanders right now, they're really struggling with the cost of living and a lot of that is at the checkout, the price of food, people are struggling. While this may take some time to implement and do well, I think that the message to the supermarkets is very clear that they need to play ball. And if wholesale access can be done right, it means that it will have a basis for a really strong, healthy, competitive market. And, you know, it's not a quick fix. It's not a band-aid. But if it gets right, then we should have a market that's actually operating in a way that means that there are prices, there are fair for New Zealanders. In fairness, I read the statements from both countdown and foodstuffs in response to Minister Clark's press release that came out yesterday. And they both said they're on board with this. They accept what the government is saying. Do you have faith? I think that they needed a really strong push from the government to make this happen, but I think they don't really have much of a choice now. So it'll be interesting to see how things play out. Obviously, we've seen the price rollbacks and things like that, but that's just not enough. So the next 6 to 12 months will be really interesting to see how the supermarkets conduct themselves. And then another big thing is actually introducing another player into the market, which is complicated in itself, right? Yeah, for a couple of reasons. So this isn't the only problem getting access to wholesale food. You also need to get access to sites. So there's a land problem, and the minister's already moved on that to say, look, we're going to get rid of some of these restrictive covenants that have been tying up supermarket sites, viable supermarket sites for a long time. So that'll help. But then you need to find someone who's big enough and has sufficient commercial confidence in order to expand into the New Zealand market. There's one really interesting thing tucked at the back of the minister's announcement yesterday, which is divestment. And what he's talking about there is forcing one or other of the two big players to actually sell sites or even sell brands. And I suspect that that's more of a threat than an intention. But, you know, he's really talking there about forcing foodstuffs to sell the pack and save brand. Now, that would be a really huge change for New Zealand if that's where he got to. I suspect that what he's really doing is saying, look, get on board with this, you know, work with us on this or else we'll come after you with a bigger stick. Because let's be clear, these are kind of threats per se at this stage, right? So it is up to the duopoly to kind of come on board with these recommendations. Yeah, and I think as Gemma says, you know, they've got a really big push now, and I think they're taking that signal, and they've decided that they're going to get on board and work with government in order to try and improve the outcomes for New Zealanders and perhaps avoid some of those more negative, you know, sort of resets that could come down the road at them. So this is going to take some time. I mean, if we're talking about an extra player coming in, that's not something that happens overnight. No, and it wouldn't even happen in six months to 12 months. You know, this is something that will take years to play out. I think what they need to see is a credible wholesale access rating, you know, something that the supermarkets have built themselves in the first instance or failing that that the government has forced on them. They need to see some better access to land, and then they need to feel sufficiently confident in the economy to take a risk on a new market, because there are no established players here. You know, there's one Costco. It's a big thing for Costco to expand beyond West Auckland. But if you're talking about ALDI, which is the disruptor from the Australian market, that's an entirely new economy that they need to get into. And that's a tricky thing for them to do as well. Do you think the government's taking this seriously, though, Andy? Do you think they're committed to change here? Oh, I think they've listened to, you know, everyday people here. I think everyday people are really suffering at the moment in terms of the cost of living. This is one thing that the government is doing in order to try to improve outcomes for moms and dads and families. So I do think that they are taking it seriously, yes. And Gemma, do you think we're likely to see change at any time soon? I mean, I'm thinking of the price freezers that both companies have put in place. Are we likely to, as consumers, to see some sort of a difference in the not too distant future? see change at any time soon? I'm thinking of the price freezers that both companies have put in place. Are we likely to, as consumers, to see some sort of a difference in the not too distant future? Yeah, I think people are watching the supermarkets really closely, so hopefully we will continue to see them be proactive in the way in which they're marking up prices, and then hopefully we can enjoy that long-term change as well. You know, when you think about Australia and the introduction of ALDI, they enjoy a much healthier supermarket sector now. And hopefully that is on the cards for New Zealanders because the cost of living is so tough right now. Hey, we really appreciate your time. Both of you, that's Andy Glennie in our Auckland studio from Glennie Legal and Gemma Rasmussen from Consumer New Zealand. Thank you so much both of you for your time this morning. Thanks.

If the last 24 hours is anything to go by, a day really is a long time in politics. We've seen the government put the supermarkets on notice and a new political poll is out, showing just how tight next year's election race could be. Here to talk more about both issues. We're joined by Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson. Morena, Deputy Prime Minister, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Can we start first before we hit supermarkets and the Prime Minister's visit to the US? Can we talk about China's visits in the Pacific? And how surprised, or are you surprised at how aggressive China has increased its efforts to extend its influence in the Pacific. And how surprised, or are you surprised, at how aggressive China has increased its efforts to extend its influence in the Pacific? Well, the Pacific is definitely a contested space. I mean, just in the last few weeks, we've seen senior visits from officials from the United States and China. So that is the reality of the region that we are a part of. From New Zealand's perspective, our relationships in the Pacific are really longstanding. We are a part of this region. The countries we work with are our friends and our neighbours. We have very close links. And so our job is to get alongside our Pacific partners and make sure that everything that happens here is in the best interests of those countries and the people of those countries. But obviously, this is an area that's seen as important by the big superpowers, and that's why you're seeing their presence in the region. Yeah, should we be relying on that partnership and our close links with the Pacific? When we look at Australian's new foreign minister has already made a trip down to Fiji, as you say, the US has made a trip down to the Pacific, Nanayamahuta, not looking to head over until the Pacific Forum, which I think is next month. So are we relying too heavily on that relationship? No, I don't think so. I mean, Nana Mahhut has been up to Fiji in recent times, so is Minister Henare, so is Minister Seale. So we continue to have that person-to-person contact along with building off the history of the relationship. And just in recent times, New Zealand's provided COVID vaccines, I think about more than $300 million worth of support during COVID to help our Pacific neighbours get through that really challenging period. So our relationships are continuous. And obviously, with respect to Australia, they had an election. There was a new government that new foreign minister Penny Wong wanted to get out there into the region to introduce herself. That's fantastic that Australia is doing that. New Zealand's continually, we're not coming from a standing start here. We have good, strong relationships and we need to keep working with our Pacific neighbours to make sure that what happens in this region is in their interests. Yeah, I'm sure there's a delicate balance here as well. We know that China is our largest trading partner, but from a security perspective, are you concerned or how concerned are you about China's moves in the Pacific? And we're talking specifically around security here. You look, obviously we expressed our concern about the arrangement between China and the Solomon Islands. That moved into a military and security zone that we're not happy about. We don't believe that is in the best interest of the Solomons or indeed the wider region, and we've raised those concerns. The presence of China more generally in the Pacific is not a massive surprise, Jenny Mae. I worked up in Saamore about 25 years ago, and China was a presence there. What we've got to make sure, though, is that all of the countries in the Pacific are able to make the decisions for themselves. And we've been a partner. It's one of the things that our partners in the region like about New Zealand is that we're there because we're part of this region, and we're going to keep building on that relationship. Deputy Prime Minister, can we talk about the US, the Prime Minister's tour of the US? We know that two of the delegates tested positive for COVID. Have we got any more news out of there and how that may impact on the Prime Minister's meeting with President Biden? Well, the Prime Minister's meeting's all set to go. Obviously the Prime Minister had her bowed of COVID a bit earlier and she's all set to go. Obviously, the Prime Minister had her bowed of COVID a bit earlier, and she's all good to go. And there are other people within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Turring Party who are going to be able to join her when she goes to the White House. And this is a really significant visit. It's an opportunity for President Biden and Prime Minister Arden to sit down and talk about the relationship between New Zealand, how we build on that as well, the Pacific issues we've been talking about, but also climate change and those trade and tourism links that New Zealand has with the US. So it's been a big trip for everyone involved. The business delegation, the Prime Minister took her, have really enjoyed it. She's been out there promoting New Zealand really, really strongly, and this is a great way for that visit to end. out there promoting New Zealand really, really strongly, and this is a great way for that visit to end. We've had a lot of chats this morning and feedback around the announcement yesterday in regards to supermarkets. 12 of the 14 recommendations have been taken on by your government of those. What do you believe will be the biggest impact, will have the biggest impact, on our supermarket shop each week or each fortnight? Funnily enough, it's actually one of the two recommendations where we decided to go further than what the Commerce Commission recommended. And that's opening up the wholesale side of the businesses. Because if there's two things that have been holding back competitors from getting in against the duopoly, it's the availability of land for their supermarkets, and we introduced legislation on budget night to stop the land banking by the supermarkets. And then secondly, access to wholesale. You can't run a supermarket if you don't have goods to put on the shelf. And so opening up that wholesale market means either the supermarkets do that themselves or will regulate them to do that by the end of the year. That means a new competitor's got the security and the certainty to get into the market and that's what will drive down prices. The duopoly's held us all a bit to ransom over the last few years. We've now got the ability through this to get more competitors in which will drive prices down. I do want to bring up, though. We had Andy Gleney a law specialist on this morning only about 10 minutes ago talking to Maddie about those regulations, and he's got questions around it in terms of how it'll actually work. I'll just play you what he actually said this morning. The really tricky thing, though, that he's going to have to give some real thought to is how he's going to set that wholesale access regime up. So that's going to take some real care. This isn't a straightforward industry. If you think about fuel, you know, like petrol is petrol and it's not particularly different from one place to another. But if you think about the huge range of things that you can get off the supermarket shelves, trying to regulate the wholesale price for toothpaste and broccoli and so on, you know, that could be really challenging. Obviously, Andy is talking about David Clark, the minister, in terms of how he's going to make these regulations happen. So, I mean, it's a fair point, isn't it, that Andy brought up? It's certainly a fair point that this is a complex sector, and it's the reason why we did the Commerce Commission market study so that we could get the best the most detailed and the best possible analysis. The point of this now over the next couple of months is to design that system and essentially we need to design it in such a way that across the board there are fair prices it won't necessarily come down to each individual commodity but an overall basket of things that people can access at a wholesale level to then sell on to us as retail. It also Jenny Mae sits alongside the other things that we're doing so the mandatory code of conduct unit pricing making sure that those the deals that you get with loyalty cards are transparent. If you put the whole package together you've got a situation where the duopoly can no longer control everything about a customer's experience or everything about a competitor's experience. And so together, I think this will make a difference. But Andy's right, we've got to take a little bit of time now to work through. That's why it will take a few more months for us to be able to get this fully rolled out. Deputy Prime Minister, yesterday you were answering questions related to this program. And you said that the government is seeking an assurance from the TVNZ board that the right recruitment process was followed in the appointment of my former colleague, Kamal Santamaria. What do you mean exactly by the right recruitment process? Well, obviously our role is not to be involved in the specifics of an appointment. It's very important that Television New Zealand is independent of the government of the day. We have our relationship with the Board of Television in New Zealand, and because obviously there have been a number of allegations that have been swirling around, Minister Chris Farfoil he sought an assurance from the board that in the case of this particular appointment that all of the right processes, the due diligence and so on were followed and we're waiting for that report right now. If it's found that the recruitment process wasn't right, what follow-up action do you expect the minister to take all what's within his power to be able to follow up? Look, and that's exactly the example of the independence because it wouldn't be a matter for the minister. It would be a matter for the board and the management of TVNZ. So what the minister's doing is hearing what we're all hearing about various allegations and saying to the board, well, you're the people we appoint. Can you give us an assurance that your management have managed this properly? Depending on what they say, the minister will either be reassured or not reassured, but the actual outcome of this is between the board and the management, and obviously there are matters that would need to be discussed with the board and the management of TVNZ. Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson, as always, we appreciate your time. TENINAQua. Namah, as always, we appreciate your time. TEN-A-Qua. Nama he knew, Kea Kota. At the Maria, here is your 730 news. Lower prices are hopefully on the way for New Zealand shoppers as the government reveals its plan to squash the supermarket duopoly. The Commerce Minister has released a response to the Commerce Commission's study, accepting 12 of the 14 recommendations and digging deeper on the other The Commerce Minister has released a response to the Commerce Commission's study, accepting 12 of the 14 recommendations and digging deeper on the other two. Supermarkets will be forced to allow rivals access to groceries at a reasonable price with regular competition checks. Consumer NZ's Gemma Rasmussen says the solution may take time, but wholesale is the way to go. While this may take some time to implement and do well, I think that the message to the supermarkets is very clear that they need to play ball. And if wholesale access can be done right, it means that it will have a basis for a really strong, healthy, competitive market. And, you know, it's not a quick fix, it's not a Band-Aid, but if it gets right, then we should have a market that's actually operating in a way that means that there are prices, there are fair for New Zealanders. And supermarkets will no longer be able to buy up land in order to stop competitors setting up nearby. A bill will be introduced to Parliament later this year. And migrants will play a key role in Al Thero's future productivity and workforce. A new report out this morning has detailed recommendations on immigration and addressing skilled worker shortages. The Productivity Commission's Ganesh Nana says migrants make a positive contribution to New Zealand's community and economy. New Zealand is a country. We've always experienced outward flows of New Zealanders, so we need some migrants to come back and, I suppose, fill the gap there, but also to contribute even further in terms of connecting us to other parts of the world, bringing in innovations, new technologies, connecting us to our trade partners, different businesses. It's just another way of ensuring that New Zealand is connected to the rest of the world. Immigration Minister Chris Faroie has welcomed the findings on Al-Tero's immigration settings. An intelligence and policy analysts believes China will continue to push region-wide deals in the Pacific. Yesterday's China's foreign minister failed to convince a number of Pacific Islands to sign a region-wide security pact. Wang Yi and his counterparts from 10 Pacific Island nations held a high-level meeting in Fiji, but we're unable to come to a consensus. This is the first of many attempts. The context is this. China has been working on these relationships using its soft power in the Pacific for over two decades. In the meantime, traditional Western patrons, I'd hate to say it, but neo-colonial patrons, have neglected the Pacific in some measure, not entirely, but in some measure. Wang Yi will continue his tour of the region today and is set to visit Donga. And Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says New Zealand needs to keep working on its relationship with the Pacific. Not coming from a standing start here, we have good, strong relationships and we need to keep working with our Pacific neighbours to make sure that what happens in this region is in their interests. And now in sports news, and the Blackcaps aren't reading anything into England's poor run of test results ahead of the first match this week. The Blackcaps have named their 15-man squad for the test, and Henry Nichols won't feature in the match as he recovers from injury. And Trent Bolt is unlikely to play after a later arrival from the IPL. England have only won one of their last 17 tests, and they currently sit last on the World Test Championship standings. Whenever we start a game, I always say there's a 50% chance of either team winning the game. So you still have to go out there. You have to play good cricket and you have to do it over five days. England, yes, they've struggled to do that for a while. But look through the players within their team. There's players who have a lot of class and have a lot of experience as well. The first test starts on Thursday at Lords. And taking a look at your weather this morning, here's how your day is going to turn out for you, Al Therr, starting in the Upper North. I'm glad to be giving you a better forecast than you had yesterday. We've got some showers here. They're a little bit heavier in Kaitaya this afternoon, but otherwise we've just got some lovely cloud hanging about. Shows in Auckland this morning and Fingare later on. 21 degrees is a high in Fingare. And heading south, we've got showers this morning here but that will ease for a pretty good afternoon. I'd say it's a lovely cloudy day later on. 19 degrees is a high in Hamilton. 20 in Tauranga. Still put your sunscreen on even with that cloud hanging about. And crossing to the East Coast, you've got some lovely cloud this morning, but later on it's just going to be gorgeous for you. 21 degrees behind Napier and Hastings. It's beautiful. Happy for you. To the west, cloudy for all through here. You've got some showers this morning. Those showers will ease later on in the afternoon. 17 degrees, oh, for half of you, I'd say, possible showers in Libin, Wellington and New Plymouth, 17 degrees is a high in Capitol. The Capitol, sorry, 17 degrees are high in the capital, Wellington. Further south, it's a wet day. Heavier falls for Westport all the way down to Hokitika, but Kai Koda, for some reason, all the sun has decided to come and focus in on you in this part of Al-Peyaroa. Everyone's going to have a wet one except for you. You'll have a beautiful day, 21 degrees for a sunny, clear day for Kaikota. And to the east, it's a nice fine day for you with some high cloud this morning, 20 the high for Christchurch and Ashburton. Gorgeous afternoon, 19 degrees of Temeu. And to the deep south, the bottom of the country, rain for Queens Town, a heavier falls this morning in Milford Sound and a cloudy start for everybody else. But that will clear for a beautiful day, Dunedin, all the way down to Raki Ureshoet Island. It's going to be a nice clear day, 19 degrees of high in Dunedin. I love those crisp clear blue sky kind of days. Beautiful. Right, stay with us. Coming up after the break, we are meeting the Kiwi runner, proving that no challenge is too big.

All new Lego Masters, New Zealand, tonight. 7.30 on 2. Wake up with Breakfast. Proudly sponsored by Dilmar Tea. Today's breakfast brewer is Dilma Earl Grey. Strong yet fragrant and infused with Bergamot. Welcome back to Breakfast. This is an incredible story. Five years ago, Kiwi Nick Ashhill set out on an epic charity run across America. But his journey was cut brutally short when he was nearly killed by a driver who deliberately ran him over. I know. 16 surgeries later, he is back pounding the pavements on a mission to finish what he started. One News, US correspondent Anna Burns-Fances is with him live in Columbus, Ohio. Morena, ABF, this is incredible. Isn't it incredible? And, you know, we've been out since about 5.30 this morning when Nick started running. And boy, can I tell you, look, I haven't seen the inside of a gym in years, let alone beat the pavement like this man does. But why don't we have a chat to him? Nick, come on in because you are the man of the hour. This is an amazing run you have done, 16 surgeries you've had. How does it feel to be back running on the road? Yeah, it still doesn't feel real, but I've had a fantastic day so far running about 47, 48 kilometres, and I've got about another 12 kilometres to do. You're doing more than a marathon a day. I know, I know. It's hard to believe. I never thought this would actually happen, you know, given the injuries that I had. But, you know, I'm back running and it's going so well. Tell us about that time, because you were in that ditch for 50 minutes until they found you. You had some really serious injuries. Did you ever imagine that you'd be able to walk again? I know talking to the doctors, they were pretty dubious about even getting you out of a wheelchair. Well, I can certainly remember looking down at my leg after being hit and I remember joking to myself that my run is over. So that was really disappointing, but I've always had this strong self-belief that one day I run is over. So that was really disappointing but I've always had this strong self-belief that the one day I would go back. I didn't know how long it would take. It's taken four and a half years to get back in shape physically but I'm back and I'm back doing something that I really love to do. You say get back in shape physically. What sort of toll did it take on you emotionally? How did you have to be able to gee yourself up to get back in the race, but also get back to the point at which you were hit? Yeah, the emotion side has been really challenging. Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression were big issues in my life for a good two years. But I had some incredible people around me to support me through the highs and lows. And going right back to basics in the gym to getting my body strong again has been really critical to why I'm here today. Now, I know there was a time when you had to learn to basically stand up again. That first moment, you say that video is quite hard to watch. Tell us about what that was like, standing up for the first time. Yeah, it was really challenging. In fact, I felt more comfortable sitting down in a bed at that point. But it was really, really important that the physiotherapists got me up quickly, which they did, which is I think around six weeks later. But it lasted, I think, 10 seconds, but it was a start. How did it feel to be back at the site today? I know you went back and had a little moment there last night. What was that like? Yeah, that was good. Good in the sense that I had some colourful words to say about the ditch and the fence. Because for our viewers, the dent is still in the barrier. It's quite visible where you were run off the road. Yeah, yeah, it is. I guess that's what a dent looks like after being hit at around 100 kilometres an hour. But it was really, really nice to have some, you know, some peaceful time with my support crew, say a few words. And I didn't even look at it when the run started this morning. Talking about your support crew, you've got some really special people running with you, don't you? Yeah, I do. Jim McCord, who ran across the US in 2002, and Paul Wheeler, who ran across the same year I did in 2017. And your doctors? Oh, what do I say about those? They joined me for the last two miles today. Probably not in as good shape as I am, but they... You said the training maybe not has gone as well as anticipated. No, they had about eight months of warning, but apparently... They were busy stitching people back together, exactly. Exactly, exactly. I think they've had a week's training, but they did so well. It was really cool to see them. How far have you got to go? We're headed to New York. Yeah, so the objective is to complete about 60K today, so that was going to still leave over 1,000k to do. And when you get there, you are raising money for a very special thing, aren't you? What is that? Tell us about it. Yeah, it's a horrible illness of the lungs called Pomeric fibrosis. Diagnosis, two to five years' life expectancy, there's no cure. So I'm supporting two charities in the world, one in the United Kingdom, but the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation in New Zealand. A worthy cause and certainly a huge amount of dedication from you to get there. So all the best. Thank you. I'll see you at the finish line. I wish I could say I was joining you, but I think we know that that's not going to happen. But it is a good cause, of course. And I very much admire Nick's tenacity, certainly, for getting back on the road after such an enormous event. It's an amazing story, ABF. And everyone needs a support crew. So don't be ashamed of the role you'll play. Thank you so much. And we'll be following this story with Anna Bird's Francis across the one-news platforms as well. Incredible.

It's 10 to 8. Now this morning Matt Gibb is out in Wind Whistle. Last time we spoke with you, Matt, you were heading out for coffee and a round of golf. How are you going? That's exactly what's happening. It's a beautiful morning here. Wind Whistle's living up to its name, though. Wind Whistle is certainly whistling with wind this morning, and I'm a bit concerned. I'm getting my clubs sorted to get out on the course, but if I shank one, it's going straight into the Require Gorge. So stay tuned for that. We'll see if I can manage to get one straight. I reckon these are my clubs. I'm all sort of, but look where we are. I'll take you through, the beautiful property. Here we are. Fable Terrace Downs Resort by M Gallery. Check out the roaring fireplace. Isn't that exactly what you would want to come to after a day on the golf course? Just sitting in front of this, warming the cockles of your heart, having some hearty food, Ryan. This is such a beautiful place. Tell me, if I was staying here for a few days, what kind of experience you can I be having? Well, it's wintertime, so hopefully you get up the mountain and go for a ski. We had a bit of snow last week. If not, you've got the championship golf course here. You can relax and enjoy fire, wine, cheese, a bit of romance if you're into that sort of thing. But yeah, we cater to all, so it just depends on what you really want to do. Because we're about, I mean, wind whistle's about, what, 20 minutes north of Metham. So in terms of being close to the mountains, we are exactly where you want to be. Correct, yeah, and about 45 to an hour from Christchurch, so just a short trip. Nice, easy drive. And you're laying on the spread for us this morning. This is what we need before we get out on the golf course on a windy morning. I recommend to, you know, fill up with some beautiful food. The restaurant actually here last night, it was so delicious. Canterbury lamb. We were served by Joe, one of the staff here. She was amazing. Your restaurant's amazing. Thank you. Yep. We also have a really unique concept for room service as well. So it kind of caters to those skiers who spend all day out of the mountain can come back to the room and cook on their time.

I'm going to take a seat here. This looks absolutely stunning. I'm going to get here. So I'm going to fill up because I am very nervous. Like golfing on TV, even if you play golf regularly, is one of the most nerve-wracking things you can do. So I don't want to look stupid. I want to look, you know, professional time. Although, Matt, so I need to be satiated. The wind might help, Matt. Check out your spread, Matt. No, Maddie, I know you might think that, but I've got a natural slice.

More reps at the lower incline slenderizes firms and tones for that longer, leaner look. While fewer reps at the higher inclines are ideal for bodybuilding. And look at this. When you're finished with your workout, just fold it up and slide it under a bed, up against a wall or into a closet. The total gym is built to last, and it comes with a warranty.

And before we get to Enduring the 8 o'clock news, we've got an interview coming up very shortly about vaping and the rise of vaping, especially in our teenagers. About 10% of New Zealand teenagers, according to a new study, are vaping daily. And so we're going to have a chat to Tim O'Connor from Auckland Grammar about, from a school's point of view, in terms of how do you actually regulate something like this? Well, how do you keep a handle on something that is just getting out of control in schools, as well as a paediatrician, about what do we actually know about the impacts of vaping? We actually had someone who works at an intermediate at school here in Auckland say to us that actually vaping, we're talking about teenagers, but she's talking about tweens given the age. For intermediate, it's around 10 to 13 years of age, and that actually they are doing it in intermediate schools, which is obviously a concern. Ben makes a point, like RTDs, you know? The alcoholic drinks. It tastes like lolly water. Yes, they're marketed at a younger audience who typically wouldn't think of smoking a cigarette. We should be worried about this. Ray is suggesting that perhaps we actually ban it, ban vaping completely. Hong Kong passed the law to ban sale of vaping in all related electronic cigarette products a couple of months ago. Yeah, I'm not sure. I think there's still, you know, there's choices around everything. It's about trying to communicate those impacts to our teenagers, which I know at times is, you know. And look, let's call a spade a spade here. There will be many of our audience who at a certain point in their adolescence went behind the bike sheds with their friends, with a packet of cigarettes and smoke it. So this is not a new thing in terms of young people picking up something that is potentially harmful for them. It's just about how do we, I guess, educate kids about, you know, what it is that they're actually putting in their bodies and what it is that they're doing. We had Bailey write into us and tell us about the success that she has had with getting off smoking by way of using vapes, but no longer using vapes, which is the original reason and the purpose that, you know, vaping became a thing here in Alta Teoro was actually to help us get off smoking but for teenagers. You know, it's, it's, a lot of it is actually about fitting in. Absolutely, which is what smoking was always about when you're at school as well, is trying to look cool in front of your friends. So, yeah, we'll be having this conversation very shortly and I I'll be asking a paedician, what do we actually know? Is it dangerous? Should we be concerned about how many kids are taking up vaping? And thank you for your feedback as well. Breakfast at TVNZ.com.com. Keep it coming in. All right. 8 o'clock. Here's in dear with your news. Fatal or Fartu. The government has put supermarkets on notice and hopefully some relief from the rising cost of living. The Commerce Minister has released a response to the Commerce Commission study, accepting 12 of the 14 recommendations and digging deeper on the other two. A lack of competition means a watchdog will monitor the sector annually rather than three-yearly. A Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says the supermarket duopoly has howled New Zealanders to ransom for the last few years. There's two things that have been holding back competitors from getting in against the duopoly. It's the availability of land for their supermarkets and we introduced legislation on budget night to stop the land banking by the supermarkets. And then secondly, access to wholesale. You know, you can't run a supermarket if you don't have goods to put on the shelf. And so opening up that wholesale market means either the supermarkets do that themselves or will regulate them to do that by the end of the year. The new watchdog will also provide a dispute resolution service between retailers and suppliers. And Consumer New Zealand's Gemma Rasmussen says the solution may take time, but wholesale is the way to go. While this may take some time to implement and do well, I think that the message to the supermarkets is very clear that they need to play ball. And if wholesale access can be done right, it means that it will have a basis for a really strong, healthy, competitive market. And, you know, it's not a quick fix, it's not a Band-Aid, but if it gets right, then we should have a market that's actually operating in a way that means that there are prices, there are fair for New Zealanders. And the Prime Minister's mission to the US has hit more hurdles. The New Zealand Defence Force plane carrying the delegation has broken down in Washington, D.C., and a third member of New Zealand contingent has tested positive for COVID. Dessenda Adirn is due to visit the White House overnight for a meeting with President Biden. And Russian forces have entered the city of Seroznytsk as they continue their attempts to capture the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine. The strategic city has seen fierce fighting in recent days. Authorities say 90% of buildings have been damaged and they've, quote, given up counting casualties. U.S. President Joe Biden has clarified reports that his administration was planning to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine. Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine? Are you planning to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine. Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine? We're not going to send the Ukraine rocket systems that's striking the Russia. And European Union leaders are divided over a proposed ban of Russian oil imports. Leaders have met in Brussels to discuss the ban, but the talks are largely being held up by Hungary. The country relies heavily on Russian gas and is the main opponent of the ban. If leaders manage to come to a compromise, it would be the EU's six package of sanctions to hit Russia. And in some sports news, and the black caps have confirmed their 15-man squad ahead of this week's first test against England. Henry Nichols is in doubt for the match still recovering from a calf injury with Michael Bracewell in as cover. Trent Bolt has been named in the squad, but is unlikely to feature having only just arrived in London following the IPL final. We've been through this before with different players, so I guess it's not something that's new to us and we'll deal with that tomorrow probably and work out what's best for us going forward with Trent Bolt in particular. And the first test starts on Thursday at Lords. And finally, this is not for the faint-hearted, definitely not for myself. A glass-bottomed bridge in Vietnam has been anointed the world's longest by the Guinness Book of Records. The Bark Long Bridge is 632 metres long, breaking the previous best record held by a bridge in China by 100 metres. It's suspended nearly 150 metres above the jungle. The glass walkway can hold up to 450 people. The bridge opened in Vietnam's northwestern Sonla province in April. Definitely not.

But what if you inhaled them into your lungs? Still sound good? Since 2019, daily vaping among teens has tripled. Now, almost one in 10 teens are vaping daily, and the numbers are growing quickly. So, we are joined this morning by paediatrician Collette Muir and Auckland Grammar School Principal Tim O'Connor to discuss this ever-changing situation. Thank you so much for joining us both of you. Really appreciate it. Tim, it's always something, isn't it? Yeah, it's been vaping for a little while now, though. That's the problem. What have you seen? Talk to us about the changes that you saw because we've been talking on the show this morning. This is the concept of ducking behind the bike sheds at school and having a cheeky-siggy. That's been, you know, long-standing. But this is different. Oh, absolutely. The days of smoking in the bike sheds and being caught were well gone. And I think we had a mature teenage population who actually knew the harmful effects of cigarette smoking. And so actually walked away from it and were advocates for actually young people not smoking. a teenage population who actually knew the harmful effects of cigarette smoking and so actually walked away from it and were advocates for actually young people not smoking. But we're seeing the opposite now because we have a product out there that is seductive. It is aimed at teenagers. The flavours tell us that. The design of the vapes tell us that. And so they are the target market contrary to what is being said that they are to take people off smoking. Well I'm sure that's certainly how it started but it definitely has evolved. So how big of an issue is it in your school for example? Oh it's a serious issue we're dealing with you know up to 10 third or 13 year olds-year-olds being stood down on a monthly basis for vaping at school because they're in toilet blocks where, you know, they're smoking a passion fruit-flavored thing. Yes. Which makes it hard, right? Because once upon a time, it was very obvious who the kids were at school that were smoking. But this is tougher to kind of police, I guess, in a way. Yeah, really, really tough to pull out. Well, we're doing everything we can. We've got vape detection devices and toilet blocks now, so it can actually trigger a message to one of our deputy heads to head down into that area so that you can actually try and find the fellas who are. But toilet cubicles closed and all of those things, it's a game. Yeah. And so Collette, how concerned are you from a health standpoint about how many young people especially are taking up vaping at the moment? Well, I think with vaping, we don't actually have long-term studies. No. Because it hasn't been around for long enough. But I think we have concerns. And I know my respiratory colleagues are quite concerned about what the potential impact in the long term could be of chemicals on that sort of delicate lung tissue. As a paediatrician, I always worry about adolescent brains, which we know are starting to continue to develop until young people are around 25. But what I worry about at the moment is actually the harm I see in front of me. So as a paediatrician who works with young people who may be having difficulties with their learning or their behaviour, it sort of worries me when young people are actually having symptoms of nicotine dependence and therefore symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. And so if you're having those physical symptoms of maybe feeling headache or maybe having difficulty sleeping or even if you're then having difficulties concentration or with managing your emotions, it actually worries me how that's impacting young people in the classroom in the day and also at home for them. Because what do we, I know as you mentioned, there's no long-term studies here, but in the day and also at home for them. Because what do we, I know as you mentioned, there's no long-term studies here, but in the short term, what do we know about vaping in terms of what's actually in them? So we know it's a vapour and I think the most important thing we know is that there's nicotine in them. And I say that as obvious, but actually what we know is some young people don't know that. They may start coming to seeing their friends vaping or be offered these devices and they may not realise that there's actually nicotine in them and that over time nicotine is a substance that can really start to lead to dependence. Tim touched on it. I guess if we are looking for a silver lining, there are fewer young people actually taking up smoking pure cigarettes, right? Right, Tim, that's what you've noticed? No, absolutely. Don't see cigarettes. No. So is that a good thing, Colleen? Oh, absolutely. So there's no doubt that over time there's been a reduction in the smoking rate, and that's excellent. And I want all youth to be smoke-free. What we also know is there has recently been a high, larger intake in youth with vaping, but I actually want youth in New Zealand to be vape-free as well. It's a big challenge though, isn't it? And it's not as easy as just putting the call out. Something's got to be done. There are regulations in place, but are we not going far enough at the moment, Collette? There are regulations in place, and look, I'm not a public policy expert, but what I would hope is that as we continue to tweak and adjust our settings around these things, we really put young people at the centre. What would you say to that, Tim? Because I think about, you know, the fact that often these vapes are being kind of targeted at a younger audience in terms of the flavours. I walk past the vaping stores constantly and there's so many of them always popping up and they're alluring. There's bright neon lights and that kind of thing. So it is just like a moth to a flame really, isn't it for young people? Oh, totally. Look, they're all through a new market. They're targeted at teenagers. We need to get rid of the flavors. You know, if we're really serious that vapes are there to actually, for people who are already addicted to smoking or nicotine, we need the flavors, the kids' flavors, all of those lollyfavors you mentioned. We need them gone. We need them removed from the country and restrict it to peppermint or, you know, some adult-type flavor that actually is not attractive to teenagers. What do you do at schools? How do you address them? How do you address it with your kids? Oh, look, all we can do is talk to them, educate them, show them all of the things that Collette's talking about, the harmful effects of vaping, and what the long-term impacts could be on them. Very difficult to get a chemically imbalanced teenager to actually understand those things. We can do that and we continue to repeat it. We have conversations with parents. We continue to put information out to parents. But while there is a seductive product that is continuing to be put in front of them, they are going to continue to be tempted, whether we like it or not. How long would it take us to get some sort of a long-term idea of what vaping might be doing to people, especially young people? I think part of it is actually what questions we ask and what studies we do. So I think that it would be very interesting to start actually looking at some of these more short-term harms that we've talked about around our interaction with the education system. But if we're looking at long-term issues around lungs and things, it's going to take a number of years. Yeah. It must be concerning, though, as someone who often sees these young people walking through your door, that potentially they don't even realise what it is that they're putting into their systems. Look, it really does worry me. And I think, you know, I think when it comes down to it, our young people are actually usually pretty sensible. And I think that I would really like to see us getting in. I know myself as a mum as well. Really nice to get in, really talking to young people really early. So actually when they're at intermediate school or even younger, talking them, teaching them, helping to learn critical thinking skills, understanding about all the teenage things they might come across when they start getting to secondary school level. And I think that that's by actually taking action and having these conversations that can really help our young people. We heard from a viewer this morning who works in an intermediate school who said they're already getting into the intermediate school. So it's really tough, especially, I guess, with the emergence of social media. You know, you see people and it looks cool, which was always the issue with smoking as well. It was seen as a cool thing once upon a time to do with your school friends. So it's a big issue, and I'm not sure. Yeah, it's hard to know how you get on top of it, Tim. Yeah, look, I think it has to come through legislation. It has to be turned into a, you know, an R21 product. It needs to be restricted from online purchase. You know, those things, we need it removed out of shopfront windows so that they're not walking past and being tempted. Those things are all critical alongside the education piece because I do think we have a very mature population coming through who will make informed decisions and are making informed decisions. They're very community-minded. We just need to actually get them to understand how this could impact on them in 10 years time and 20 years time. Hey, we really appreciate your time this morning, both of you. It's a big issue and we'll continue to follow it up as well. And yeah, we appreciate your insight, both of you.

This morning, our squash team, which is heading to the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, is being named. New Zealand players rank amongst the best in the world in squash, with Paul Cole ranked number one in the world, and Joelle King ranked fifth in the world but at this year's games a number of Kiwi Squash players will get their chance to showcase their talents so we sent our very own talented sports department Zion Dale down to meet one of the athletes go you good things Zion, what in us? Talent is the perfect word right now I'm absolutely nailing the squash core. I think out of all of the announcements that I've come to, racquet sports is probably the best one. We're just actually having quite a big rally here, but I'll wrap it up and there we go. And then, oh, no, that didn't quite work out. Yeah. Good try. No, that's right. Our squash team is being announced a little later this morning, and we've had a little bit of an insight in who's going to be there. There's seven Kiwi players representing New Zealand in Birmingham, and one of them joins me now, Luamba Chalisi. Thank you very much for joining us. Congratulations. You're off to your first Commonwealth Games. That must be pretty exciting for you. Yeah, it's pretty surreal, eh? I mean, our sport isn't in the Olympics, so Commonwealth is kind of the pinnacle of our sport, so yeah, it's great. Obviously, grew up watching a lot of sport. A lot of people represent New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games for different sports, so it's amazing to finally kind of make it, yeah. And it's not only your first Commonwealth games you'll be going to, but you're also going to be playing alongside your brother in the doubles, so you're playing singles and with your brother in the doubles. That must mean quite a lot to yourself and to your family as well. Yeah, yeah, it's great. Pretty lucky to have a brother my age. We'll get along very well. Obviously, you're going to be playing the doubles together. So, yeah, it's exciting. Hopefully I won't argue too much on court. Yeah, but, yeah, very exciting. And Squashia, New Zealand has come a long way, and I think that's recognised on the world stage with Paul Cole being the number one in the world. Juel King up there as well. Squash, sorry, is growing here in New Zealand, isn't it? Yeah, it is. I mean, it helps a lot to have top players in the world. It's a bit of a struggle for us because obviously we don't have the numbers in the sport compared to other countries. So, yeah, it's great to have both male number one and female in the top five. It's really good for us young guys coming up. People to look up to great role models, both of them as well. So it'd be good to play alongside them this year. You just turned 23. This probably is the best birthday present to get going to the Commonwealth Games being named. How did you find out? Was it quite a special moment? Yeah, it was. I got a call from the high performance manager, Shelley, on Monday last week. So, yeah, we were kind of a little bit anxious, waiting to see what was going to happen with the team. Obviously, we kind of knew we were a contention, but didn't know exactly what they were thinking. So, yeah, it was quite weird getting the call. Didn't really know how to react at the time and it took a couple days to really sink in, yeah. And what are you making your competition so far? What you know of them going over to the games? Yeah, I know quite a lot of the players there. I was just in the UK for the last eight months, kind of, so I know all the players that are there, I've hit with most of them. So yeah, our work is cut up for us, definitely definitely but it's going to be a great experience and yeah just looking forward to being there you know amongst the New Zealand team with the other athletes as well and just finally before we go I don't get a lot of love from my colleagues back at work my sporting abilities but I was all right was all good yeah your potential definitely yeah it's a recurring theme. That's the second time someone to say that to me, that I've got potential. Which, yeah, I'll take that. I'll take potential. But yeah, the rest of our, thank you very much for joining us this morning. I really appreciate it. Congratulations, we will be watching. And the rest of our squash team gets named a little later this morning. And so, yeah. Keep practicing, Zion. But, yeah. I'm just having mad flashbacks to my childhood. Potential. You've got potential, man. Whenever I gave any sport a go. I love it. Never quite worked out, though, Zion. Thank you, Zion. Actually, have you tried squash? Oh, once. And stupidly, I went with Jack Tame and Chris Chang, who play all the time, right? Weekly squash, and it was my first game. I don't know what I was thinking. And they smashed you on the cops. Absolutely they did. And you know me, I'm very competitive. And so I just spent the entire time really annoyed. Yeah, and they wouldn't have been easy on you. No, no, they took real pleasure and glee in beating me. It's a hard sport. It's fast. Very fast. I'm useless. I'm useless. Yeah. You're going, are you on a Commonwealth athlete. Yes, I'm heading off to the Commonwealth Games to cover it for our breakfast team, so that'll be a lot of fun. Amazing. Yeah. Can't wait. How many days to go? 58? Oh. Oh. Yeah. Looking forward to that. Right, it's just gone 830. Here is Endera with your news. Morena. The government's given supermarkets a clear message, play ball, or we will crack the whip. The Commerce Minister has released a response to the Commerce Commission's study, accepting 12 of the 14 recommendations and digging deeper on the other two. Supermarkets will be forced to allow rivals access to groceries at a reasonable price with the regular competition checks. Competition law specialist Andy Glennie says an interesting point to the announcement is divestment. What he's talking about there is forcing one or other of the two big players to actually sell science or even sell brands. And I suspect that that's more of a threat than an intention. But he's really talking there about forcing foodstuffs to sell the pack and save brand. Now that would be a really huge change for New Zealand if that's where he got to. I suspect that what he's really doing is saying, look, get on board with this, work with us on this, or else we'll come after you with a bigger stick. And supermarkets will no longer be able to buy up land in order to stop competitors setting up nearby. A bill will be introduced to Parliament later in the year. And the Prime Minister's mission to the US has hit more hurdles. The New Zealand Defence Force plane carrying the delegation has broken down in Washington, D.C. And a third member of the New Zealand contingent has tested positive for COVID. Dressinda Adirn is due to visit the White House overnight for a meeting President Biden. And migrants will play a key role in Al Thero's future productivity and workforce. A new report out this morning his details recommendations on immigration and addressing skilled worker shortages. The Productivity Commission's Ganesh Nana says long-term immigration policies are some of the core recommendations from the report. In the end, it's about long-term settings for those connections. I would think the immigration policy announcements have still focused on the short-term considerations. It's those long-term considerations about building our capacity and building our ability to use the skills that migrants bring in with them. Immigration ministers Chris Farfoy has welcomed the report. And vaping uptake among teens has tripled since 2019, and nearly 10% are using it daily. Recent studies suggest most adults vape to try and quit or to give up smoking. But most teenagers vape for curiosity, enticed by various flavours. Auckland Grammar School Principal Tim O'Connor has described this rapidly growing issue as an epidemic. The days of smoking in the bike sheds and being caught were well gone. And I think we had a mature teenage population who actually knew the harmful effects of cigarette smoking and so actually walked away from it and were advocates for actually young people not smoking. But we're seeing the opposite now because we have a product out there that is seductive. It is aimed at teenagers. The flavours tell us that. The design of the vapes tell us that. The design of the vapes tell us that. The new vaping amendment act, which came into force in November, aimed to make e-cigarettes less appealing and less available to teens. And in sports news, 19-year-old Holger Roon has put the French open on notice after an upset win over World No. 4, Stefano Sitsi Pass, for a place in the quarterfinals. Rune won the first set before dropping the second, but held his nerve to take the next two to win in four sets. The teenager becomes the first Danish man to reach the quarterfinals of the tournament. It's the biggest win of Holger-un's life. It's taken until day nine, but we finally have an upset. And Kiwi player Erin Routless, the Roland Garros campaign has come to an end after losing her third round doubles match in three sets. Nice. Thank you, Indira. You are a really interesting email come in from someone who says they work in the vaping industry. Yeah. Is that... Oh, it's anonymous. Anonymous, yeah. I work in the vaping industry. Yeah. Is that... Oh, it's anonymous. Anonymous, yeah. I work in the vaping industry and we have to abide by a strict set of rules set by the government regarding marketing and what types of flavours we can sell. These rules are stricter than they were for cigarettes. Way stricter. Not all flavours are available with dairies as such. You can only purchase fruity or appealing flavors directly from a vape store, which you need an ID to enter. We've seen a rise of adults purchasing vapes for teens and parents buying these for their teens. Constant stories of teens taking parents, vapes, etc. What should really be looked at is how parents are handling this, is they are the biggest access for teens to vaping, and the blame shouldn't be shifted onto vape companies. No, and I don't think the blame is being shifted onto vape companies. What we're talking about this morning is the rise in vaping amongst our teen actors, right? And it's a whole, it's a kind of society-wide approach in terms of what do we know, how are we tackling this, how are we addressing this with our teens, are we doing enough to let them know about what it is that they're putting into it? Yeah, and I guess it was really interesting because the conversation you had with the school principal and a pediatrician was around. Actually, it's really, really tough. I mean, you know as a parent of a teenager that sometimes those conversations are really hard to have. Not actually having the conversation, but actually getting them to listen to what you're trying to say to the cut through, which is exactly what your paediatrician was talking about. You know, even though our teenagers potentially know what is in it and that it is harmful, even though we don't have any long-term studies to back any of that up at this point in time, you know what is in it, the chemicals that are in it, that they're going to be having an impact on your health. And, you know, I mean, I think about athletes and you can tell them, like in five years' time, if you carry on, you won't be able to walk, and they'll go, oh, well, can't think that far ahead. I'm in the now. And a lot of our teenagers, that's how they think. They're in the now. And you know what? You can do as much as you can as parents. But when your 8-year-old child comes home with a vaping stick, which is what one of our viewers has said, you know, that's kind of out of your control. So there is so much you can do, and boundaries are needed. They're exposed everywhere that they go. And again, it's, you know, yep, I get it. As parents, we have to take responsibility and have those conversations with our children and hope that they make the right decisions for themselves. But the reality is vaping is out there and it's everywhere. It's in, as one of our viewers said, they're 8-year-old. It's in intermediate schools. It's in secondary schools. We know that. But it's been a really interesting conversation. We appreciate you sharing your own stories with us. So thank you. Right, what's happening? Oh gosh, weather? Weather. Yeah. It's thanks, Maria.

Call our About Health Team on 0800-9-309-309. We're heading up north now to KauktƒÅkata. Last year, students were so worried about the danger posed by the traffic outside their school that they wrote to Waka Kota, the New Zealand Transport Agency, asking them to make their school safer and reduce speed limits. And their petitioning was successful, becoming one of few schools with a variable speed sign in place, hopefully stopping fast and furious wannabes from racing by. So our reporter Grace Thomas is at Co Kau Kappa Kappa School to learn how they drove the idea forward. Morena, Grace. Morrina team, that's right. I am at Ko Kau Kappa Kappa School and I'm with the woman that made it all happen with her Tameriki. Andrew Clark, Mornina. How did this happen? How did this start? I know it was a couple of years ago. It was 2020 when you started petitioning, but tell us a little bit about what that petitioning process was like. It started with our children, so we were trying to get them out for road patrol, and nobody would do it. And we know we had bribes of hot chips and chocolate and things like that, and they still wouldn't do it. And when we talked to them, it came out that they were actually scared to be out there even with the training and with an adult out there and we looked at it a little bit more widely and loads of our kids were feeling the same and we knew that that wasn't the right thing to be happening for our children so with new zealand police we organised a meeting with Waka Kortahi, and they came out. They listened. They stood where we're standing now, and they saw the problems that we were having and the amount of traffic and the speed that was going past. So they could see the seriousness of it with us. So they decided to come and collect some data, and they worked out that there was, and we've got a big logging truck going past now just to demonstrate it, that it was a really high-risk situation for our children to be in, and so they started the process, and it was a really easy partnership, actually. I didn't think that it would be, but they collected voice from the community. They came in, we had a community event, they had a stand, so people could ask questions about it. They listened to, you know, 150 submissions from our children about what they wanted to see happen and it was a really easy, easy process from there and when the signs went in it was a real celebration day for our community and for our kids to see that they could make a difference. Totally and I mean even just now you can hear the trucks going past, that logging truck was a big one. And I guess you know when you can't convince kids with the promise of chips and chocolate, you know that something is wrong, isn't it? They don't feel safe and they should outside their school. Absolutely. And we know that it's worked because as soon as people see those flashing signs now, we see them check, look down at their dashboard and you can see their cars slow down. Our kids are telling us they feel safer and we're filling all the road patrol spots. So that's the sign that it's working. Love it, love it. So tell us what the speed was before. So if we get our camera up, Chris, just to head down the road there so that just around the corner is where the variable speed limit starts. So tell us what it is now. So it goes through an 80K into a 50kk now. But what Wakakortahi found was that the mean average of the speed of those 5,000 vehicles per day was well above, above that. So when the variable speed sign is on for that half an hour, it goes down to 40Ks, and it has made a significant difference. Definitely, but we would like it to be lower, wouldn't we? So Waka Kortahi is open consultation for the Northland Speed Review, and that's with the hopes of getting these speed limits down even lower. So tell me what you'd like to see, Andrea. I'd like to see it down without a question. What we know is that our kids are impulsive, and they're easily distracted, and it's up to the adults to make it safer for them. And I will take 60 seconds more on somebody's journey if it means my children arrive safely to school, and I will take 60 seconds more on somebody's journey if it means my children arrive safely to school and I send them safely, safely home and I don't think anyone would ever say no to that. And what would be your message to the community about these speed limits if they're thinking of putting their feedback in about them? Yeah, put in the submissions to support it. It's about the safety of our Tamariki. There's nothing more important than that. So let's just say yes. Let's get it done. Let Wokatahi do their job that they're so good at. Definitely. And I mean, I'm sure you've been able to hear in this cross here with Andrea, you know, the trucks are rolling on behind us. And it's just about making sure that our kids get to cut us safely, isn't it? Nothing more than that. Simple is that. Andrew, thank you so much for your time this morning. We really appreciate it. Gosh, she was absolutely brilliant, and so were you this morning, Grace. Who is that can Andrea, thank you so much for your time this morning. We really appreciate it. Gosh, she was absolutely brilliant and so were you this morning, Grace. Who is that canterate? Who is that? Like, yeah, let's, where's crap a lot? It's a protest behind us. Really?

You are both pro. Yes. Carrying on. Amazingly, and so did you, Grace. Thank you so much. Thank you, team. Go Kappa Kappa School for looking after your Tamariki. It totally to talk all this kau-paba, actually. It's awesome. And great to hear it was working. Yes. These are going down to 40 kilometres. And how neat for the kids to be able to have that um that feeling of being able to make a difference yeah it's a really it's a really incredible lesson for them to learn at such a young age empowering right empowering yeah beautiful all right hiariaki and are coming up we're back to wind whistle to see what matt has in store for us.

Oh. morning, Matt Gibb is out in Wind Whistle. Mordina, Matt. What are you up to? Oh, just cruising along with the golf cart at the moment, Maddie. Morena, yeah, Ryan and I are just pulling up to the 16th tee, aren't we, Ryan? Yeah, the signature hole here at Fable Terrace Downs by M Gallery. Beautiful. You can see why this is the signature hole. Come on over here, Lee, let's get over this way because check out this view. Would you drink that in? What a place for a golf course, what a place for a hole. This, as you can see, right now actually, Lee, have a look down there. That's the Rekiah River down there. This is the Rekiah Gorge, so Mithfin's about 20 minutes that way. And you can see right up on top of there, that's southern else. Mount Hutt is right there. So if you're looking for a place to ski and then come play golf and stay, how could you find a better spot than this? And actually my brother, four years ago, got married right here, right in this very place. So it's a beautiful, it's a special place for me as well. I absolutely love where we are right now. But I am putting off what's about to happen because I'm very nervous about this. Ryan, obviously, has got everything set up. We've got a par three, 110, 115 to the pin. Yep. So we're going to hit a pitching wedge and see if we'd embarrass ourselves. Now, he's a scratch golfer. He's been a scratch golfer in his time. So I'm going to let you go first and show me how it's supposed to be done before I embarrass myself on national live television, Ryan. So after you, my friend, show me how it's done. I won't put you off by talking all three back. I know you can if you want. It's fairly fine. Here we go. Oh, okay. It's right-ish, but you're definitely in contention. You can get up and down for a birdie there, can't you? Maybe, yeah. That required gorge is right there. If I slice this, it's going straight into the gorge, but we'll give it a guy. Go with it, Matt. Go with it, Matt. Go with it, Matt. Thanks. Yeah, no putting me off. No, putting me off. No, no. Here we go. You can do it. Okay, no pressure. In the hole! Oh, no! We did a go! It's a beautiful! Oh, Matt! You should have seen the practice shot 10 minutes ago. I'm never going to believe me, but... I can vouch for it. I'm going to leave. That's it. I'm done with television. I'm that old chestnut. Let me compose myself because I do need to tell you about this competition that we're running this week. That was the most embarrassing thing I've ever done.

You can't miss it. I feel like I need to redeem myself and hit another shot at the end of this. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think too, me. Get another place. Get another place. Oh. I'm going to drink this, compose myself and then hear another one. Yeah. Mmm. Okay, just to show you that I'm not completely terrible. Here we go. One more. Wait, what was that, man, by the way? I'm so hungry, yeah. What was that? Just not completely terrible. Here we go. One more. Wait, what was that, man, by the way? I'm so hungry, yeah, what was that? Just a delicious smoothie and lovely fruity berry smoothie. Just, you know, that's the sort of thing you get here at the Fable Terrace Downs Resort by M Gallery. Okay. All right, you can do it, Matt. Okay, just got to think. Calm thoughts, here we go. More like this, I reckon. Oh, shanked it again. It's gone about 20 metres. It's in the gorge. It's in the Rakhai Gorge. Fuck, man. Don't be too hard on yourself. You know what? I think you'd be better than either one of us sitting here in the studio. So go you. That's for sure. Although, in Dera, I heard saying... I definitely want to get into it. I think I want to play golf. I know. It's such a vibe for me watching it. What's a conversation you two were into? Like the cruising along, chat, cat, chat. Okay. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. That's us then. Will you come? No. Come to make of anything. Just come sit in the caddy and drink your wine. I am... I am terrified that mine would look worse than that. I'd somehow end up hitting it backwards, I reckon. Yeah, probably. But anyway, you guys will have a good... I've got very low expectations for myself. It's about participation, isn't it, Jamie? You can just come be our driver, Jenny Mae. Yeah, no. No. Yeah, good luck with that, you too. Thank you so much for your feedback as well. We've been talking vaping, but actually we're also talking about food waste. Yeah. And how much we actually waste in the first instance. And it's so much. It's an insane amount. I think it's about 86 KGs each household throws away of edible food each year. We want to follow this conversation up tomorrow because we have had a lot of feedback from you saying, actually actually I don't know what to do with my food waste. Many of you also have come up with some amazing ways that you are dealing with your own waste. But yeah, based on the feedback in terms of not 100% sure what to do with it, let's do that tomorrow. So I appreciate your company today as always. Thank you for being with us. We appreciate you, and we look forward to seeing you again tomorrow. Hey, our Poppo. First of June tomorrow. Oh, God. See you tomorrow. Wow."}
