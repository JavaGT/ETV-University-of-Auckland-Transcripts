It's Konga Karede Otero-Tereo-Irangerau. Good morning. I'm Nicola Wright. The Prime Minister's confident the mask rules in the orange traffic light setting are not confusing. All of New Zealand is now in orange, meaning there are no limits for indoor or outdoor gatherings and masks aren't required in as many places. When announcing the government's decision to ease restrictions, the COVID-19 Minister, Chris Hipkins, incorrectly said masks were not required on public transport and in retail. Jacinda Ardern says people should continue to wear masks where possible. Under orange, masks are still required in retail stores and on public transport, but not in restaurants or schools. Kudha Kopapa are being encouraged to stick with mask rules, despite the lifting of the mandate. Masks are encouraged for schools but aren't mandatory. The co-chair of Terunanganui or Ngaupapa Māori Raweri Wright says the organisation is urging its kura to keep using masks. The Ruananga Nui is encouraging all kura to stick to the routine of wearing masks. Those who are most being affected are our Māori people and those besides the elderly who are dying are again our people. Dawiri Wright says government advice for kura koupa throughout the pandemic has been abysmal. Heavy rain has finally cleared in Teira Fiti after intense downpours overnight. 200 millimetres of rain was recorded in the northern part of the region in the five hours to midnight. The highest intensity was measured in the north of Gisbon yesterday morning, 51mm and 2 hours, which MetService describes as extraordinary. It's still raining in the hills between Gisbon and Wairoa and former Cyclone Fili is quickly departing the coast. Some roads were closed overnight due to slips and fallen trees and they'll be reviewed this morning. An overseas recruitment campaign targeting intents of care nurses has employed just three people since it launched two months ago. The program was set up to entice New Zealand qualified critical care nurses back from overseas to ease acute workforce shortages. The health minister Andrew Little says filling three jobs is a good result and the government is trying to bolster the workforce as quickly as it can. National's health spokesperson Shane Reti says it's an appalling result and does little to ease the pressure on critical care nurses. The $300,000 recruitment drive is running until the end of June. Russia says more than a thousand Ukrainian Marines have surrendered in the besieged port of Marupol. Journalists saw flames billowing from the giant Azov-style steelworks where the Marines had set up defensive positions, but a top advisor to the Ukrainian president insists the city is still standing. The BBC's Anna Foster is in Ukraine. We know that the fighting has been happening for weeks. We know that the scale of destruction is huge, but actually trying to find out the reality of what is happening there is very difficult. Now, there are some suggestions that the battle could be towards its end, that it may end in favour of Russian forces. One thing that people do predict might happen is that if Mariupol does end up in Russian hands, that will free up more troops to head to the east. We've seen satellite imagery suggesting that the next battle on the eastern flank of Ukraine could be happening very soon. The Foreign Affairs Minister says MP's efforts to haul the Russian ambassador before them for questioning are not very useful. Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee is investigating whether it can summons Georgi Zoyev, who has twice rebuffed their requests to appear before it. The ambassador has diplomatic immunity, so he's not obliged to give evidence as a witness. When asked about the committee's efforts, the Foreign Minister Nanaya Mahuta said the ambassador is protected by the Vienna Convention. She says those protections may render the whole exercise not very useful. It's understood MPs will discuss the matter with Parliament's Speaker and the clerk of the House this morning. Some builders are threatening to bypass council inspections, saying it's taking too long to get inspectors on site. Inspections in Christchurch are currently taking about seven weeks. Builder, Peter de Gao, says the delays are adding tens of thousands of dollars to the costs, leaving builders with just two options. One is to either comply with these delays and probably face financial ruin. And if they don't comply, the second option is to ignore the inspections, go ahead, book them as you can, but just go ahead and build the house anyway. The chances are you won't get co-compliance at the end. A residential build requires between 8 and 12 inspections. In sport, the Wellington Phoenix have won their final game in Australia before they come home, beating Perth Glory 1-0 in Sydney. The Phoenix, who host Central Coast in Wellington on Sunday, are sixth in the A-League standings. Northern Ireland women's football coach Kenny Shields has drawn intense criticism for suggesting that women are more emotional than men, therefore making them more likely to concede two goals in quick succession. Northern Ireland were beaten 5-0 in a World Cup qualifier yesterday. Andrew MacDonald has been appointed the Australian men's cricket coach in all three formats for the next four years after overseeing their recent test series victory in Pakistan in a caretaker role. McDonald's served as an assistant under Justin Langer since 2019 and took the reins in Pakistan after Langer declined the offer of a short-term contract extension and resigned. And the defending champion Lydia Koh has just teed off in her opening round at the LPGA Tour's Lothay Championship in Hawaii. That's the news. This Saturday morning, words, language seemed to be a theme this week. Jan Kent, pretty much the only female in the male gang of the young New Zealand poets in the 1970s, has written a memoir about her early life. Word Smith and veteran journalist Jim Tucker has a lot of stories to tell. And Keith Kahn Harris has a book called The Babel message, a love letter to language in all its variety. Porkin Hilloh, join me Saturday morning from 8 on RNZ National. Now the forecast from Met Service to midnight, Northland is fine apart from one or two morning showers at the west coast. Auckland to Taumaduui, also Coramandel and Bay of Plenty, fine. Gisbon and Hawke Spey scattered rain clears this morning, becoming fine this afternoon. Wairarapa, also Taupo, Ta-Hapa and Taranaki to Wellington, areas of morning cloud with a shower or two for Wellington and southern Wadarapa, otherwise fine. Nelson to Westland, Malbara, Canterbury and Otago except Clutha, areas of morning cloud for Canterbury and the Bula Rangers, maybe a shower there, otherwise fine with evening cloud for the west coast. Fjordland, and Southerland partly cloudy, isolated showers in Fjordland and along the south coast. Chatham Islands rain and it may be heavy with thunderstorms. Strong Sutherleys gale this afternoon and evening. In the main centres, Auckland, fine, southwesterlies fresh for a while this afternoon and a high of 20. Thuranga Fine, Southwesterly's dying out this evening, 21. Hamilton fine, Sutherley's die out this evening, 20. Wellington's fine, apart from some cloud in the chance of a shower this morning. Sutherley, strong and exposed places early this morning, gradually dying out, 15 degrees. Christchurch Fine, North Easterlies from afternoon, high of 16, and Dunedin Fine with light winds, 19 degrees. You're listening to RNZ National, on air online, on IHeart Radio, Sky TV and Freeview And we're funded through New Zealand on air It's coming up to 8 minutes past six After 80 days in the red COVID-19 setting New Zealand is back in orange Good morning, everyone, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National Now the relaxing of restrictions Comes with perks for Central City bars, restaurants and cafes After 11 weeks, business owners say they're pleased to see an end to mandatory seated service and limits on capacity. They're also preparing for a bump in bookings and sales as office workers returned to the city. A reporter Katie Todd visited the Vivace restaurant on Ford Street in Auckland. Its owner Mandy Lusk described her relief at yesterday's announcement. We can't really survive it, read, so very happy. It's a little bit late in that it won't make a difference for us now until... And that's just us in our business, really until beginning of May, a lot of the people have gone now who are heading away on holidays and long weekends and school holidays. So the big firms have indicated to us that now that they know we're dropping to orange, that they will be returning and asking their staff to come back, even if it's part-time, from the second of May for them which is great. Well quite rapid. Yeah, just many of them haven't been back in the office since mid-August so for us that makes a huge difference in town. I know that friends who've got big bars and things like that and some of those places around the Viadah will probably make a bit of a difference for the over Easter. Having said that there's an awful lot of places who don't open any longer on public holidays and so but they'll get Saturday you know which will be great. And what changes for you from tomorrow night can you sort of move the tables of it close together and? Yep people are allowed to come and stand which makes a big difference if you've got a bunch of people catching up for a friend's birthday or coming after you know after work we've been sitting at a desk all day they're allowed to stand up and have a drink which psychologically for a lot of them makes a big difference and so they were just staying in their own offices and having drinks, those that were around, so that they could do that. And, yeah, definitely being able to put tables a little closer together. Probably while we're at our own, still keeping a little bit of distance. But, yeah, for us, the big difference is simply getting people, some of these bigger firms, bringing their teams back now. And that was reporter Katie Todd speaking to Vivace Restaurant owner Mandy Lusk. It is 10 minutes past six. Well, the move to Orange comes despite the number of new Omicron cases sitting irritatingly high in the south of the Motu. But those on the front line of Southern Health Services say they're holding up even as cases remain a persistent strain on clinicians. Our Otago Southland reporter Timothy Brown has more. A couple of months ago, Lumsden GP Matthew Stokes, was the only beacon of hope among some dark forecasts about what the COVID wave heading south might mean for the southern DHB. But Dr Stokes says his quiet confidence in rural healthcare services in the south has been largely borne out. I feel my optimism was actually well founded. Our population are coping really well. We've had over 200 cases and we had probably a peak a week ago of about 25 new cases a day. But our population have been well. Very few people have become unwell to the point of needing admission, in fact only one, and they are now fitting well. He says the Omicron outbreak has brought a lot of work with it, but not the devastation to lives and healthcare services some had feared. Dr Stokes says a large part of that is due to vulnerable populations being sensible and sparsely populated rural communities naturally flattening the curve. Certainly seems to be youngsters bringing it home to the parents and not so much the elderly population. They seem to be largely isolating themselves and keeping away from potential infectious situations. But COVID cases remain naggingly high, with more than 1,300 cases recorded on Monday, sitting just below the peak recorded three weeks ago. Epidemiologist Michael Baker from Otago University says geography is at play with the wave washing out of the cities and into regional New Zealand. What we're seeing in New Zealand is a city pattern and a more of a rural pattern. So at one extreme we had Auckland, which had peak case numbers on the 4th of March. And it's really the first DHB where we're seeing numbers go below 100 cases per 100,000 people. And at the other extreme, you still got over 300 per 100,000, so three times higher in places like southern South Canterbury, for instance, and also on the West Coast. But while cases have remained persistently high, deaths and hospitalisations have remained low, with only 26 people currently in hospital in Southern DHB with COVID-19. Professor Baker says he expects the drawn-out wave has played a part in that, along with high vaccination coverage. Having a very sharp peak in Auckland does mean there's a lot more pressure on the system, whereas if you have a more prolonged epidemic, as we're seeing in the South Island in particular, it might be that the capacity to manage people at home is better, because you're not seeing so many sick people at the same time. Well South's medical director Carol Atmore says community providers have held up, with clinicians stepping up, and as a result, so far no practices have had to shut their doors due to staff shortages. They've responded by people working harder, working into the evening, doing long days, and I really take the hat off too. The people on the ground who are just doing what's needed to keep their patients safe, everyone's digging really deep and people are getting tired as you would. She says the South isn't on the downward slope of the outbreak yet. About 1 in Otagena Southland have got COVID, you know that's quite a few. Dr Atmore says people should remain cautious for a couple more weeks. It is 14 minutes past six now. The past 24 hours have been tough. As we know, on Taerafati and the Wairoa district with that weather, Met Service red warnings for heavy rain in the regions have now been dropped, so that is some good news. But Easter, of course, is a busy weekend with people travelling on weather-battered roads. Daniel Corrigan is a meteorologist with the Met Service who joins us now. Good morning, Daniel. Good morning. All right, so the worst of the weather looks to have passed, is that right? Yeah, that's correct. So Cyclone Philly is on its way southeast of the North Island this morning, quickly moving away from the country. And rain and strong winds with that system have stopped in most places. There's just a little bit of rain hanging on in the Faridatas between Wairo and Gisbon, but otherwise the rain has already cleared. How much rain was there, in particular in those hard-hit areas and the catchment areas, did we see a lot as expected? So the hardest hit area was around East Cape, and Gistran District Council rain gauges around East Cape recorded 200 millimetres of rain between Tuesday evening and midnight last night, which is an extraordinary amount of rain to fall within that time. And at that particular station, 50 millimetres of that rain fell within just two hours between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. yesterday. But the rivers and the area held up to some degree, it didn't seem as bad as last time. Yes, potentially. But there still seem to have been significant impacts from this weather event. Yeah, I mean, that amount of rain washing down the rivers is going to cause some problems. Are you aware of anything in terms of slips or land conditions? Yeah, I'm aware that there have been fallen trees in areas of surface flooding. So there definitely have been some impacts with all of that water accumulating, especially in the ranges during that short period of time that has to drain out into the rivers. Yeah, absolutely. So that means for people driving on the roads in that area, what do they need to think about and watch out for over the weekend? So definitely keep up to date with the latest updates from Waka Kottahi, NZTA, and make sure you know that on the roads that you're driving the conditions and if there's any road closures or any dangerous elements to travelling along those roads. But as far as the actual weather they're going to encounter, it actually looks like it'll be relatively sunny. Yeah, so it's looking like a sunny Easter weekend in most places in New Zealand. There are a couple of exceptions to that. So there is a front that is looking to make its way up the South Island during Saturday. That'll bring some rain to the west coast and to southern South Island regions. But that eastern part of the front looks like it'll fizzle out pretty much before it reaches Christchurch. And that front may be bringing a few showers into Gisbon on Sunday. But most of the country is looking to remain largely dry. On Monday and Sunday night, there may be some heavy rain and strong winds in Northland for people around that part of the country or travelling up there. But otherwise, it's looking like a fairly settled weekend with high pressure in charge. Well, that is good to hear for most people. Enjoy it while you can by the sounds of things. Daniel Corrigan, thank you very much from the MET service this morning. It is 17 minutes past six. We can go now to Helen Harris from Waka Kotahi, who is on the line. Kiyohra. What is the situation with roads up in Tairafti and Wairwa? Okay. Well, we here try to maintain the state highway network around the East Cape for our residents as much as possible open, but at 9.30 last night we had to close it all the way from Gisborne to Portaka. State Highway 38 also closed, and that was due to flooding. Overnight also State Highway 2 south from Gisborne to Wairo, is taken down to one lane. Now the biggest issue for us this time has been trees. The trees have fallen and they have fallen, multiple trees have fallen in multiple locations. Okay. So how long is it going to take, do you think, to do the work to get those roads reopened in that case? Well, our contractor safety was the most important thing last night, so we weren't going to have them out on the network. So what they have planned for is that they are out at first light this morning and starting to clear the trees. So we're progressively hoping to open throughout the day. We are prioritising because our colleagues in the power company, the Eastland Group, can't maintain their power supply without access to our state highways, so collectively working together. We have crews that are going north and south to open the roads. I just would say that some of the trees are, you know, there are multiple trees and they are big trees that have come down and they are blocking the whole network. Yeah, I was going to ask how significant is some of this. We're talking big trees and right across the road and, I mean, this is the sort of thing where people are going to have to cut them into several pieces to take them away. It's going to be quite a big job. Yes, absolutely. You know, quite often when we talk about trees being across the network it's a single tree and it's quite easily removed but the photos that I've seen particularly last night they are massive trees so they will be there for some time and of course it's not just a matter of chopping them in the middle and removing them but debris has to be taken away as well so pushing them to the side to open the road um where the trees are sorry no on you go it is our intention to make sure that we have the state highway open. It's not going to be pretty. Definitely not going to be pretty. Our intention is that everyone should be able to travel around our network for Easter. It's really important, obviously. And the contractors will do the absolute best. The road will not be pretty, but it will be open as our intention. When the trees have fallen, have there also been slips, or do you have issues with falling rock or loose ground above any of the roads as well? Absolutely. I think the message that I'd really like everyone to take away is that on top of everything else that we've been dealing with just because it stopped raining, those same issues apply. Slips can come down at any time, more debris can come across the road. We're in a very, very fragile network situation, and just because it stopped raining doesn't mean the issues go away. So the situation that you're dealing with, you're hopeful that you'll be able to get all the roads open today? Yes, correct. That seems like a pretty reasonable result, I suppose, in some ways, considering the scale of the job that you're going into. Yes, we've got a number of contractors out on our state highway. Obviously, this is a specialist removal, so there's a lot of arborists who can help in this respect. And the tree issue is a matter of chopping through, getting to the next one, chopping through, getting to the next one. So progressively opening the network is our intention. You were talking about people being able to make their way around the network is our intention. You were talking about people being able to make their way around the network at Easter. But how concerned are you about the state of some of these roads, especially seeing as this is the third, I think, significant flooding event in the last few months? And how damage some of those roads could be by the water or indeed by the trees coming down on them? Yep. So that is why we're taking measures such as the road from Portaka, sorry, the road from Toakamura Bay to Tapuya Springs will, when we have opened the road, we will revert back to our management plan, which was it is closed from 7pm to 7am to 7am. That is the section between Tokamara Bay and Tapuya Springs. And that is because of the previous damage. So yes, the network is fragile. And I think most people who are now travelling around the network have seen it during daylight. Previous to this event last night with the trees coming down so people totally can understand what we're dealing with. Thank you very much for the update. Helen Harris there from Waka Kota'i. At 23 past 6. Some developing news from overseas now, the subway shooter who opened fire on a subway in New York has been found. Reports say the suspect is in custody in Manhattan. It follows an extensive manhunt with police earlier seeking a person of interest named Frank James. The New York Police Department had been hunting for a van after uncovering a set of vehicle keys that were left at the scene of the shooting. The shooter fired 33 shots hitting 10 people miraculously though no one was killed. Huari Ben Kada was sitting next to the shooter on the subway and was shot in the leg. He spoke to CNN's John Burnham. All you see is like a smoke, black smoke bomb going off and then people bum rushing to the back. This pregnant woman was in front of me. I was trying to help her. I didn't know they were shots at first. I just thought it was a black smoke bomb. She said, I'm pregnant with a baby. I hugged her. And then the bum rush continued. I got pushed. And that's when I got shot in the a black smoke bomb. She said, I'm pregnant with a baby. I hugged her. And then the bum nurse continued. I got pushed, and that's when I got shot on the back of my knee. Did you see the shooter open or drop the smoke canister? I didn't. Once I entered the train, I wasn't paying attention to anybody. I wasn't looking to anybody. I was on my phone or my headphones on. And all you see was black smoke. And I turned to the right, the guy with a mask on, you know, with a MTA vest. There were some reports that the suspect was mumbling to himself before he started shooting. Did you notice that or anything else about the behavior beforehand? You know, I just had my headphones in my ears, my phone on my hand, mind of my own business, and my head down, sitting down. But this makes me not want to ride a train over my life. I was just on my way to work. That was subway shooting survivor Huari Ben Khada, speaking to CNN's John Berman, and just repeating that news that the police have found the suspect, the subway shooter, this morning. Now, let's look at traffic in Auckland this morning. A little bit to report there. Henderson Valley Road is closed between Great North Road and Smyth Road. This is due to a police issue. And motorists should allow extra time for delays in the area. We'll keep you up to date on any developments there. Kona Korda or Fakhira more ten aita, our main stories on Morning Report this morning. Restaurants and cafes are getting ready for a boost in trade. After the move to the orange COVID setting, we're going to speak to the COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, very soon, in fact. The move comes as COVID infections continue to rise, though, in Otago and Southland. And Tarrafati and Wairoa are entering clean-up mode today after 24 hours of heavy rain. Well, let's go to our business reporter now, Nicholas Pointin, who's in with an update on the markets. Good morning, Nicholas. Good morning, Corrin. Wall Street, looking pretty positive. How did our market go after that cash rate announcement yesterday? Yeah, well, our local market extended its losing street to six days. It fell 14 points for about 0.1% to 11,875. It's been, you know, look, it's been a pretty long losing streak. Looking at Wall Street, though, remember its inflation data came out yesterday showing the annual inflation at a fresh 40-year high of 8.5%. But investors seem to be coming to the conclusion that inflation has peat, and that's what's sort of leading this rebound. The Dow Jones up three quarters of a percent. The SMP 500 up nearly one percent and the NASDAQ is up 1.8 percent. The New Zealand dollar trading at 67.9 US cents and 91.1 Australian. Right, so the Kiwi dipped a bit after that AirbnbZ decision. You'll have more on that in your main bulletin? Yes, we will. And we'll also look more a bit after that AirbnbZ decision. You'll have more on that in your main bulletin? Yes, we will. And we'll also look more in detail at the RBNZ decision with one economist saying it's the beginning of tough action for the rest of the year. New Zealand king salmon, it says it's cutting production after warm waters killed more fish this year. And Sky City says it isn't seen a flood off overseas interest since the tentative opening of borders yesterday. We'll have all that plus the latest from the financial markets just after 10 to 7. Nicholas, thank you very much. Nicholas pointed there with your business update this morning and at 27 minutes past 6. It is time for the rural news now with Sally Murphy in Christchurch, Otahati. Kiyoda. Kiyoda, good morning. Now the agricultural products issue with the free trade talks for the EU, that is still ongoing. Boy, that's taking a while. Yeah, the person in charge of negotiating the deal has told exporters, negotiators are still trying to find a middle ground around agriculture tariffs, but his hopeful progress can be made. Formal talks between New Zealand and the European Union began in 2018, with 12 rounds of negotiations taking place since. In a virtual update yesterday, MFAT's chief negotiator for the deal, Vangelis Vitalis, said the EU hasn't yet brought a commercially meaningful offer for commodities to the table. As always, whenever someone is negotiating with New Zealand, one of the big challenges is always going to be in the agriculture sector. That's always disappointing to us, but it is one of the realities that we face as a country that is very competitive in the agriculture area. Now, in particular, with the European Union, the traditional items remain a challenge, and they are dairy, sheep, meat and beef in particular. And those are the ones on which we have yet to get a commercially meaningful offer that we can work with from the European Union. Now, New Zealand signed a free trade deal with the UK last month, removing tariffs on almost all existing exports, including wine, honey, onions and kiwi fruit, and phasing out tariffs on dairy and red meat. Vangelis Fattalas expects negotiations around primary exports will be a sticking point for the EU. So it is really the dairy, sheet, meat and beef and unfortunately, again, in my experience, it is those items that always are the ones that hit us very hard right at the end and do prove to be the most challenging to work through. I am confident we will find solutions to all of those and that we will get a commercially meaningful outcome, which of course is the government's instruction to us. But of course it's still hard work and we're pressing the European Union hard to get that offer on the remaining sensitive items onto the table. And he said the EU's desire to protect over 2,000 food and beverage geographical indicators is still a sensitive issue, but he wants negotiations wrapped up as soon as possible. Okay, now a New Zealand clothing brand is hoping to drum up some demand for a hemp fibre fibre industry here. Tell us more. That's right. The new label, Hemp Reno, sells knitwear made from a single blend of merino wool and hemp fiber. Co-founder, Chauvoneau Malley, says the hemp fiber is currently imported from China, but the marino is sourced locally and the products are manufactured in New Zealand. She says locally grown hemp fiber for clothing isn't available here yet, but she's hoping that will change. The piece that's missing in New Zealand at the moment is actually the processing, so taking the plant that's grown and turning it into a usable fibre for apparel or for packaging or insulation and like huge range of uses. And there is a group in Canterbury who are working on that problem right now and we've been in discussion with them the whole way through, bringing them every six months asking them if we've got apparel fibre from New Zealand yet. But we're just waiting and we want to be their customer as soon as we can. Shavorno Malley says hemp fibre can be grown in a variety of conditions and could be an alternative for farmers looking for different land uses. In New Zealand we have been making big gains in terms of growing hemp for cosmetics, for food source, for oil, things like that. But a hemp plant that grows for fibre is a slightly different variety. And the piece that's probably missing, like hemp plants grow amazingly in New Zealand and are really beneficial for our soils, you know, as co-founders, we're all farmers, and we actually came at this thinking, this would be an incredible plant to add diverse income to farm, but also to be beneficial to the soils in the land that we farm. That's Chavonne O'Malley, and that's the rural news for this morning. Lovely, thank you very much for that. It is coming up to, what have we got, 29 minutes to 7. Let's look at your weather. Well, after all that rain, certainly that Gisbon and Tairafti have experienced, it's going to be a fine day across the all of the Motu. Auckland, 20 degrees today. Tauranga 21, Hamilton 20, Wellington 15, Christchurch 16, and even 19. The warmest place at the moment is Kaitaya on 17. And the coldest place is Twissel at, what have we got? 0.3 degrees. Now, coming up 4-7 on Morning Report, Chris Hibkins joins us to talk about what it means for New Zealand to now be in the orange traffic light setting. There's a few people unhappy about that. We will have the latest on the weather damage in Tairafati in Wairoa after that heavy rain. It did continue to a large extent through the night. And the UK Justice Minister has resigned in protest after the Prime Minister Boris Johnson was fined for breaking COVID-19 restrictions. And what of course has been dubbed Party Gate. Now the news with Nicola Wright. The Prime Minister Boris Johnson was fined for breaking COVID-19 restrictions in what of course has been dubbed Party Gate. Now the news with Nicola Wright. The Prime Minister is rejecting suggestions mask rules in the orange traffic like setting are confusing. All of New Zealand moved to orange overnight. When announcing the shift, COVID-19 Minister Chris Hipkins incorrectly advised masks are no longer required on public transport and retail stores, when in fact they are. National and Act says the slip-up shows the traffic light system is confusing and should be scrapped. Jacinda Ardern says people should continue to wear masks, wear practical. The casino and hotel operator, Sky City, says the move to orange is a significant step for the tourism and hospitality industry. The new rules mean the end of all gathering limits, as well as no more requirement for people to be seated and separated in restaurants. Sky City Chief Operating Officer Callum Mallett says the company's thrilled. He says there'll be more capacity, but he warns customers it might take a few days for normal service to resume. The ability for customers to find those bookings at the time that we have could be challenging, but most operators will move pretty quickly to ensure that they can welcome as many guests as possible. Callum Mallet says the company's getting bookings from Australia as the border reopens. Intense downpours in Tide Aphiti overnight have cleared this morning, but rain still falling in some areas. 200 millimetres of rain was recorded in the northern part of the region in the 5 hours to midnight, on top of heavy downpours earlier in the day. Damage from yesterday's storm left people from Wairoa to the top of East Cape without power through the night. Cruise will be back out this morning trying to get them reconnected. Roads that were closed overnight due to slips and fallen trees will also be reviewed this morning. The finance minister says the rising cost of food is a global problem linked to disrupted supply chains. Food prices are 7.6% higher than in March last year, the biggest annual rise in just over 10 years. Grant Robertson told first up some things driving those increases, such as closed ports in China, are out of his hands. And he says other countries are also experiencing higher food costs. Mr Robertson says the government will work to rein in supermarket profits and ensure consumers get a fair deal. New York police have arrested the man suspected of the rush hour attack on one of the city subways. The suspect was spotted by two police officers on a Manhattan street and has been taken into custody. 29 people were injured when a smoke bomb was set off and multiple gunshots were fired on a train. Ten people remain in hospital but no one suffered life-threatening injuries. Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky's made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to Ukraine to repel Russia's forces. In an online English-language address, Mr Zelensky said freedom must be better armed than tyranny. The images of Boucher and Mariupil have demonstrated real Russians' intentions to the whole world. It could only be stopped by force of arms. It must be done now. Ukraine needs weapons supplies. Vladimir Zelensky says Ukraine needs heavy artillery, armed vehicles, air defense systems and combat aircraft. Some builders are threatening to bypass council inspections, saying it's taking too long to get inspectors on site. Inspections in Christchurch are currently taking about seven weeks. Builder Peter DeGao says the delays are adding tens of thousands of dollars to costs. He's told the council his builders may just take photos and carry on if the council can't provide an inspection within a reasonable time frame. Mr. DeGal says waiting for inspections can mean building firms face financial ruin, but carrying on without them risks not getting a completed code of compliance. That's the news. Country life this week is with a tiny herd of mischievous dairy goats. They eat straw hats. If I'm not careful, they'll eat this hat right off my head. These goats have undone my shoelaces, and they're trying to eat the domes on my jeans. Oh, gosh, I think you might have got one. You're going to wreck this cardboard box if I let them. Guys, this isn't a good box. Country Life Friday nights at 9 and Saturday mornings after the 7 o'clock news on RNZ National. Now the Met Service regional forecasts, the situation. Former Cyclone Feli moves away from the Gisbon Coast today, easing the strong-to-gale-force southerly winds and allowing a ridge over the South Island to spread north. A front, though, moves up the South Island on Saturday, gradually weakening, followed by another ridge, a complex low approaches from the north on Sunday. For today, though, Northland is mainly fine, One or two showers along the west coast this morning, southerly winds. Auckland, Waikato, Waito, Taumar, Rue, Coramandel Peninsula Bay of Plenty and Rotteru are fine. South to southwest winds ease through Auckland and die out elsewhere. Gisbon and Hawke's Bay scattered rain from Wairoa District northwards clearing this morning and then fine, southwesterly strong along the coast, gradually easing. Wairdapa, including Tharardua district, Thadarnaki, Ta'hape, Taupo, Fanganui, Manuatu, Hora Feneru, Karpiti Coast and Wellington. Areas of morning cloud, with a shower or two for Wellington and southern Wairdapa, otherwise fine, southerly strong and exposed places this morning, dying out this afternoon. Nelson, Malbara, Canterbury and Otago, mainly fine, frosty at first with areas of morning low cloud or fog. Cloud at times south of Dunedin from afternoon, afternoon sea breezes, but westerly south of Dunedin. Buller and Westlands start fine, part from some cloud for Buller this morning with the chance of a shower or two. Then cloudy spells everywhere this evening, southwest breezes mainly along the coast. Fjordland and Southland are frosty start, then partly cloudy. Isolated showers in Fjordland and along the south coast. Westerlies fresh near the coast in Stewart Island. Chatham Islands rain may be heavy with thunderstorms. Strong Sutherlies rise to Gale for a while this afternoon and evening. Tomorrow's outlook, the North Island is mainly fine. The South Island are poor-po fine for most. A few showers, though, for the south coast, in southern westland and Fjordland, turning to rain there at night. Friday, Rale, at the Chatham's cloud at times. It's 22 minutes to 7. And you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. It's time to catch up on Sport Now with Barry Guy. Good morning Barry. Morning. Now, the Phoenix. Yes, Sunday. This is fantastic. They've been hanging in there all season. They haven't had a home game for two years and they look like they could touch wood, make the finals. That's right. And at home on Sunday and we're all hoping that we don't put too much pressure on them and they can score a couple of Wednesdays. They're at Sky Stadium on Sunday to play the Central Coast Mariners and then next weekend at Eden Park in Auckland to play the West and Sydney Wanderers. And when was the last time they played at home? It was such a long time. I think I went. Well, before COVID hit in March 2020, they were playing regularly there. Since then, they've only played two games in New Zealand. So it was 300 days ago the last time they were here. They had two games when there was that sort of gap in the middle. A big one here, I think. The one in Wellington, they got close to, or it was a record regular season home crowd for the Fiends, almost close to 20,000, and I'm sure they'll be wanting to get something similar to that this time. Well, they've been playing in front of no crowds, more or less over there. They have earned it, not just because they are sitting in fifth and in with a chance of a top spot or a higher spot, but they're playing good football. They play attacking football. Yes, they lose some big losses, but they get some good wins. Exactly. And, you know, as long as you beat the teams that are below you and pick up a few points elsewhere, then they're doing okay. So they're up to fifth. They beat Perth last night, 1-0 in Sydney, and now they return home. They come home on Friday to play that game. So, yeah, Ulfurtale has got them, he's a clever guy, a clever coach, and he's got them playing, you know, to the best of their ability. He says that all they've done is focused on the games in hand. They haven't tried to get too excited about returning home, but they are ready to return home now and show all the local fans just what they're made of. And I'm hoping to see that on Sunday. I mean, a full strength side is kind of cool because, you know, they were down nine players, I think, and then they got hammered in those two games. Well, just this week, McGarry only just returned, I think, on Wednesday, and he played last night. And there was another player whose name just, he is unavailable to return home. He's got to stay in Sydney until next week because he came down with COVID. So he's going to fly straight to Auckland next week also. So looking forward to that. And also if you're looking forward to going to see some indoor action this weekend, of course, three netball games. All the tickets are available now. They are in Christchurch, in Vicaragua Rotor in the A&Z netball premiership. And of course, the National Basketball League starts in a couple of weeks too. So everyone will be able to go to that as well looking forward to it, something to do, Corrin, a couple of beverages and watch some sport. Love it. Thank you very much, Barry Guy. It is 19 minutes to seven. Well, New Zealand has, as we know, moved today to a new traffic light setting, orange rather than red and the change does mean all gathering limits have gone and customers no longer have to be separated and seated to be served at hospitality venues. Masks are still required in retail stores and on public transport but no longer in restaurants or schools. COVID-19 response. Minister Chris Hickens joins us now. Good morning. Good morning. Well, let's start with yesterday. I mean, look, we all have bad days at the office, but that was a bit of a shocker for you in terms of the mask messaging. Yeah, look, it was a bad day for me. I misread my introductory notes, which created some confusion, and then I got a little fussed and made confusion worse. I'll own that. It was a mess. It was a mistake, and it was a mistake that I made. Fair enough. Look, the issue is, though, I guess, that when you've got a culture of masks that has developed, which is good, is there a risk that, not just obviously your mistake yesterday, but the change in settings, the talk about masks and can you use them in bars and not and blah, blah, blah, has undermined that behavioural shift, which is very important. Undoubtedly, look, I've been kicking myself since yesterday. I made a mistake yesterday, and it was a damaging one. But ultimately, the main message here at Orange is that masks are really one of our major defences against COVID-19. You know, you can reduce transmission of COVID-19 by up to 50%. That's a lot of people who won't get COVID-19 if people continue to wear their masks as we're asking them to do. And, you know, there is a rationale behind where you're required to wear one and where you're not. In an outdoor environment, COVID-19 doesn't spread as easily as it does indoors. When you're going to a nightclub or a bar, you're going to be drinking and eating, and it's actually quite practically difficult to hold a mask, but you're also making a choice to be there. On the other hand, when you're going to a supermarket, people have to go to the supermarket in order to survive. You're going to have elderly people, you're going to have people who have immunocompromised, who'd be very vulnerable if they got COVID-19, and so requiring masks there helps to protect them. But why remove it from schools? And that seems to be the one area which has upset a lot of health experts, Susie Wiles, Michael Baker, Jim Russell, others who are experts in this area, urging you to rethink this. Ultimately, schools can still require the use of masks. It's just no longer mandatory right the way across the board. But that opens up to all sorts of problems. You leave it in the hands of schools. They've got communities. Some people aren't going to want to wear them. Some children can't go to school because they're sick and they've got chronic illnesses. And then you're leaving it to the schools to have to deal with this. And schools are in different phases of dealing with COVID-19. So in some cases, you know, they've already experiencing friggin outbreaks of COVID-19 cases, and they've come out the other side of that. On the other hand, there are some schools who are still, you know, experiencing a peaking cases. So there'll be different, you know, there'll be a different set of pressure for different schools across the country. We do acknowledge that the feedback that we've had from school communities is that this has actually been one of the hardest parts of... Well, what was that feedback? Did the school community, did teachers and principals ask you to remove this rule? Oh, look, it'd be fair to say, there's been quite a range of feedback from the school communities, but the schools have found this a very difficult requirement to enforce because young people, you know, they have not necessarily the easiest people to get to wear their masks and to get to wear their masks properly. Okay. So what is the advice then to a parent of a child who does have a chronic illness or who is at risk, who now doesn't want to send their kid to school? Talk to the school about what can, what they can do around that. Schools, you know, have been having conversations with parents about that, and I'd encourage them just to keep talking to their school. And what about things like ventilation systems? I mean, not every school's got one yet, have they? Most schools have doors and windows. Come on, you can't expect as we go until winter to let kids sit in the cold. Well, no, look, we've looked at this really closely. So if you've got the doors and the windows open in a classroom, then the air will replenish about 30 times, 30 to 60 times in an hour. An air cleaner will replenish the year about three times in an hour. Now, in the winter, when it gets colder, if you open the windows about a centimetre, so you're just basically allowing a bit of a draft in to replenish the year. That's still going to replenish the year as well as a commercial air cleaner is going to clean the air. So opening windows in winter is a viable option and strategy to help deal with this? It's not going to be, there's going to be a limited number of cases where it's not because, you know, where you've got schools that are covered in snow, for example, it's not a practical option. So we will make sure that they have portable air cleaners to cover those sorts of settings. But for a lot of our schools, just having a bit of a, you know, just recirculating the air, even opening the doors between lessons and then closing them again, it's still going to replace the air as effectively as a portable air cleaner would. Just finally, I mean, we're talking about, we're seeing case numbers, in particular for over 60s, the older population in the south, still rising, vulnerable communities, those older populations. Why is the setting changing for those parts of the country which haven't, maybe they've peaked, but only just, and it's certainly not for the older New Zealanders? We look at the rate of hospitalisation, the rate of new cases right the way across the country and making this decision. Of course, you know, the health system, while it doesn't operate as a national, nationally-cohesive system as much as we are aiming for it, too, it does operate as a national system in patients where one hospital under pressure do get transferred between hospitals and so on. So those are the sorts of things that we've absolutely mapped out and looked at. So that's what you would do. If you start to see hospitalisation rates get too high in those areas because of the move to orange, you'd just start shipping people around? It's already been happening. So in some cases it's not COVID patients that have been moved. It's people for other reasons have been moved between hospitals in order to balance out the demand on hospitals. That is what the health system does every winter when the influenza rates start to peak. COVID-19 response Minister Chris Hibkins, thank you very much for your time, 13 minutes to 7. The UK's Justice Minister David Wolfson has quit in protest after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was fined for attending a birthday party thrown from him, for him rather, breaking COVID-19 restrictions. Mr Johnson is the first serving UK Prime Minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. Here is what Labour leader, Secere Starmer, had to say. My thoughts are with all of those who did the right thing and for whom this is a real slap in the face. They made the most unimaginable, heart-wrenching sacrifices. And many were overcome by guilt, guilt at not seeing elderly relatives, not going to funerals or weddings or even seeing the birth of their own children. But the guilty men are the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. They've dishonoured all of that sacrifice. They've dishonoured their office. This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister had been found to be in breach of the law. And then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better. They have to go. Well, Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have so far rejected calls for them to resign over the fines. The BBC's Rob Watson's covering the story and is with us. Now, Kiyora, Rob, thanks for being with us. We're what, about 24 hours into this since it broke. This is the first resignation. There was real palpable anger back when this was first revealed. Is that likely to rear its head? Akira, a morning, Susie, and morning everybody else. Well, I think we'll have to separate that out between the mood in the governing Conservative Party and the mood in the country. To take the mood in the governing Conservative Party, and in the short term party and in the short term they're the ones who really count because we're not due an election here until 2024 so if Boris Johnson was going to be removed that would be done by conservative MPs and so far at least and I say so far the mood appears to be that while they're not happy about what's happened there isn't much of an appetite for a leadership contest to sort of then move very swiftly on to the mood of the people I mean I'm in our while they're not happy about what's happened, there isn't much of an appetite for leadership contest, to sort of then move very swiftly on to the mood of the people. I mean, I think from what I can make out from listening to what the BBC has done here and other media outlets here in the UK, I mean, I think people are just really furious about the idea that there was one rule for all of us and a different rule for those in the government. I mean, people are furious about that then, are furious about it now. And I think the most recent polling I've seen on it, Susie, suggests that a majority of people do think that the prime minister should resign. Why is it that Conservative MPs seem to be, at least in some ways, rallying around the Prime Minister here, because it wasn't that long ago that they were having furious constituents coming to them saying, you've got to do something about the Prime Minister, and they kind of were. Well, I think it's Ukraine. I really think that is basically it. I think there's a feeling inside the governing Conservative Party that it would just look kind of weird and self-indulgent to be changing leaders in the middle of, you know, the biggest global events since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. It's interesting, though, that you said, Susie, that the mood a few weeks back was ugly. Conservative MPs were responding to angry emails from their constituents. And I think that, you know, if you like, that'll be the decisive factor going forward. I mean, let's say, you know, these MPs who at the moment are sort of sitting on their hands, despite Ukraine, despite everything else, if they think that their, you know, their constituents are saying, you know, he's got to go. That could change things again for the prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, has been embroiled in a further controversy and crisis around his non-domiciled status of his wife and also having an American green card, I understand. How precarious is his position? Well, he has gone from hero to zero, right? I mean, he was thought he was one of the most popular politicians during all the COVID lockdown because he was doling out money to businesses, doling out money to individuals. Now his popularity is in free fall because of the incredible squeeze on people's living standards in this country and the sense that he has raised taxes on millions is in free fall because of the incredible squeeze on people's living standards in this country. And the sense that he has raised taxes on millions, and yet one millionaire, his wife, is not paying all the tax that she might be, not that anyone's suggesting anything illegal. So a huge problem for him. But actually, to link back to the question you asked me before, you know, why aren't the conservatives getting rid of Boris Johnson? It is in large part because of Ukraine, but it's also because there's not really an obvious successor to Mr. Johnson. And a few months ago, that obvious successor would have been Rishi Sunak, but he's now looked, at least for the time being, to be a busted flush. Thank you very much. That is Rob Watson of the BBC there there speaking about the situation with Boris Johnson. It is now eight minutes to, I think it's eight minutes to seven. It is eight minutes, seven. You are right. We're just going to have a quick look at traffic for the moment. Auckland. Henderson Valley Road is closed between Great North Road and Smyth Road. That is due to a police issue. The 141 and 142 bus routes are being detoured and a total of 11 bus stops are being missed. So do take note of that. Motorists should also allow extra time for delays in the area. Central North Island, the desert road is closed between Rangipur and Waiuru due to a serious crash and motorists should allow extra time for a detour via State Highway 49. And the east coast, State Highway 35, is closed all the way from Oquitou, north of Gisbon to Potaka, due to fallen trees between Gisbon and Tolaga Bay. State Highway 38 is also closed in Fraser Town at the intersection with Parkor Wai Road due to flooding. State Highway 2 is down to one lane south from Gisbon to Waira. So a little bit of disruption there in that Gisbon Pai, Rafati area from that weather overnight. We'll have a little bit more on that later in the program. It is, what have we got, 7 to 7. That is time for business. Nicholas Pointin. Asamari, a good morning coming up in today's bulletin. Rates to rise further, king salmon in hot water, and I have the latest from the financial markets. The Reserve Bank's large rate hike yesterday is the start of tough action for the rest of the year, according to one economist. The central bank raised the cash rate by half a percentage point to 1.5%, a move that was not unexpected. But some commentators said the RBNZ was late to the inflation party, and others were puzzled why the big rise now, but a reaffirmation of the February rate projections. Infometrics chief forecaster Gareth Kennan says the RBNZ should have been going harder much sooner, and he says the rises will keep coming. We're going to continue to see strong data coming through, indicating just how stretched and stressed the economy is, and that will push them towards another 50 point rise at the next review. The most recent forecasts we're pushing the OCR up to around about 3 and a quarter, 3 and a half percent towards the end of the forecast period and we're very much of the view that that's where the OCR will be possibly sooner than they had indicated. We're looking at the end of this year or into early 2023 reaching those levels. But the reality is there is a lot of inflation in the system. Infometrics has just issued new forecasts which point to annual economic growth of around 2%, although probably not a recession. Gareth Kennan says conditions are changing and with that comes some negatives. You are having to move away from the sort of almost sugar rush that the economy has been running on with very low interest rates and the fiscal stimulus. In some of the sort of really strong growth areas that we've had, such as the construction sector, there is pretty much no more capacity to grow. We're also facing sort of cost of living increases on top of the interest rate rises that are squeezing household budgets. And so the sort of spending demand that we've had will slow quite markedly as well. And you add on to that fact that we've got the borders reopening now. In many cases you'd see that as a good thing, but there are real risks about a brain drain. That's Gareth Kenan from Infometrics. Well, Moorra-based king salmon is cutting production as warm waters hit its operations and prompted to raise fresh capital. The company's made a full year loss of $73 million because of increased fish deaths, higher freight costs and $59 million worth of write-offs. It's going to strengthen its finances with a $60 million share offer, giving shareholders an option to buy 2.85 new shares for every one they hold at a discounted price of 15 cents each. Chief Executive Grant Roseworn says they'll also spend on operations, including combating rising fish deaths in warmer seas. The fact that we've had this serious mortality event this summer has led us to change our strategy. So instead of trying to go through the summer using these various improved techniques, we're now changing to avoiding warm water summers. And for this reason, we're confident that we will become a more stable, reliable producer of king salmon. Grant Rose-Warn says production will fall over the next couple of years but then improve. Well, the casino and hotel operator, Sky City, says it's not seen any rush of foreign visitors as borders tentatively reopen, starting with Australians. Its chief operating officer, Callum Mallet, says there were 250 Ford bookings from Australians for its Auckland hotel last week, and it expects that to grow. The change to the orange traffic light setting is raising his optimism, but he expects a gradual improvement. The Australian market being opened is a significant step, because now even if they don't rush to book, the opportunity exists for them to book, and as airlines increase frequency of flights, we're really confident that the Australian market over time will return like it was pre-COVID, so we're really excited about that as a big step for the industry. It's Callum Mallet from Sky City. We're turning now to the markets and looking at Wall Street where the main indices have all rebounded with some investors coming to the conclusion that inflation has peaked at 8.5%. On the currency front, the Kiwi rose then dipped after the Reserve Bank rate high as markets looked past the headline 50 basis point rise and focused on the fine print, with the bank talking of sticking to its previously established public rate path. The New Zealand dollar is trading at 68.2 US cents, 91.1 Australian, 51.8 pence, 0.624 euro, 85.2 Japanese yen, and 4.33 Chinese yuan. Brent crude oil is up $3 to 107 US $16 barrel, and gold is up 0.6% to 1,97 US in ounce. That's business for now. I'll be back at around half past eight. The variable oyster catcher, Tooria Pongu. RNZ National Court Corrondane. Now, to marry, call Susie Ferguson-Coccoingoa. It is Rappare, Thursday, April the 14th. Ifai'erki-Nay, top stories this morning. Hospitality operators are welcoming the freedom of an orange traffic light setting as a significant step. Now, a modler is concerned the move could exacerbate already high Omicron case numbers among over-60s in Otago and Southland. Also an overseas campaign to attract intensive care nurses has resulted in just three getting jobs. Builders are furious at weeks-long delays to get council inspections. Weatherwise, it's going to be fine all across the more. RNZ News at 7. Kiyara, good morning. I'm Nicola Wright. Limits on indoor gatherings are now a thing of the past as the entire country wakes up in the orange traffic light setting this morning. The rules for mask wearing have relaxed slightly too, but the changes have confused some, including the COVID-19 minister. Here's our political reporter Katie Scotia. Under orange, masks are still required in retail stores and on public transport, but no longer in restaurants or schools. When announcing the government's decision to ease restrictions, the minister, Chris Hipkins, incorrectly advised, masks were not required on public transport and in shops. National and Act say the slip-up shows the traffic light system is confusing and should be scrapped. But the Greens say it's not the right time to move to Orange, with the vaccination rates for children and booster rates for Māori and Pacifica not high enough. Proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test is no longer required on domestic Air New Zealand flights under Orange. Passengers will again be offered food and drink from tomorrow, but masks will still be required. Air New Zealand Chief Executive Greg Forren says removing some COVID-19 requirements makes sense. Vaccination policies for international flights will be removed from May 1st. The Finance Minister says the rising cost of food is a global problem linked to disrupted supply chains. Food prices were 7.6% higher than in March last year, the highest annual rise in food prices in 10 years. Grant Robertson told first up some of the drivers of soaring food prices are out of the government's hands. I've seen similar increases in other countries around the world. So this genuinely is a global problem. And as a result of that, the solutions to it are difficult for New Zealand on our own. We've got supply chain constraints. China's got lockdowns that are closing their ports. Grant Robertson says the government will try to rein in supermarket profits and ensure consumers get a fair deal. Several parts of the State Highway Network on the East Coast are closed this morning after intense downpours yesterday and overnight. 200 millimetres of rain was recorded in the northern part of the region between 7 o'clock and midnight. Ruth Hill reports. Cyclone Philly has finally departed and the rain has cleared, but now the clean-up begins. Walker Kotahi says trees have fallen in multiple locations. It was forced to close the road between Okitu north of Gisbon and Portaka last night. State Highway 38 is closed, and State Highway 2 between Gisbon and Wairoa is down to one lane. The agency hopes to progressively open roads throughout the day, also giving access for East Link contractors trying to restore power to outline communities. The highest intensity of rain was recorded in the north of Gisbon yesterday morning, with 51 millimetres falling in two hours, which MetService describes as extraordinary. The College of Critical Care Nurses says a recruitment drive for intensive care nurses working overseas is progressing far too slowly. The $300,000 drive set up to entice ICU nurses back to Al Therua has employed just three people since it launched two months ago. The college's chair, Tanya Mitchell, says it's reassuring some nurses have come home, but it's a drop in the bucket. We've had a long time of working understaffed, and that is hard on nurses when they feel like they're not able to provide the level of care that they'd like to for the patients, that the patients aren't getting the best care that they need. The health minister, Andrew Little, says three jobs is a good result, and another 22 nurses have been referred to DHBs for possible employment. A further 28 applicants are still being assessed. New York police have arrested the Brooklyn subway shooting suspect. The man was spotted by two police officers on a Manhattan street and taken into custody. CNN's Shimon Procupix reports. Just two officers on patrol. The guy is just walking the streets, like as if nothing has happened. The world is looking for him, and he's just walking the streets, and two officers riding in their car perhaps, maybe on foot, we don't know. They see him, they stop him, and they arrest him. Also, overnight, this morning, the NYPD and other law enforcement officials, the US marshals, have been working through the night, into the morning, going to different locations to try and locate him. Certainly no one expected him to just walk the streets, like as if nothing has happened. Twenty-nine people were injured yesterday after the suspect deployed a gas canister before firing at least 33 times on a train. Frustrated builders are threatening to bypass council inspections because it's taking so long to get them done. Inspections in Christchurch are currently taking about seven weeks and the Master Builders Association says it's time for the government to fix the consenting system. Emma Hatton reports. David Kelly from Master Builders Association says it's time for the government to fix the consenting system. Emma Hatton reports. David Kelly from Master Builders says there are severe cash flow problems in the industry and delays and inspections are making things worse. He wants a centralised system set up, adding the cost would be marginal compared to what is lost when there are delays. A Christchurch builder, Peter DeGal, says the current delays are adding on tens of thousands of dollars and firms face financial ruin because of it. The Christchurch City Council has brought on extra staff to try and address the problem. Floods in the South African province of Kwa Zulu Natal have killed at least 250 people. Some areas got a month's worth of rain in one day and local authorities are calling for a state of disaster to be declared. Officials have called it one of the worst weather storms in the country's history. Mudslides have trapped people under buildings and more floods are expected. In sport, the Wellington Phoenix have climbed to fifth place in the A-League before their long-awaited return to New Zealand, thanks to a 1-0 win over Perth glory last night in Sydney. Coach Ufukthalai says it's nice to be heading home on the back of a win. The win tonight was very important. It wasn't a complete performance, but I think it was a good enough performance to get the job done and get the three points, and I think the boys will be pretty excited to fly back on Friday. The Phoenix hosts Central Coast in Wellington this weekend, their first game in New Zealand in more than 10 months. Iax boss Eric Tenhag is on the brink of being confirmed as Manchester United's new manager. United say no deal's been done, but reports in the Netherlands suggest an agreement in principle is in place. Andrew McDonald has been appointed the Australian men's cricket coach in all three formats for next four years after overseeing their recent test series victory in Pakistan in a caretaker role. Former Black Cap Daniel Vittori will take over as Birmingham Phoenix coach following McDonald's appointment. That's the news. Mark, looking back at that video, God, it's a joyous thing to see him. You must be pretty sad to have lost him. Monty was just, yeah, I mean, he was a world beat. I mean, I didn't get 100 million tweets, but he did. You wanted to show people that rescue dogs could be smart. And we did. We had a very successful global, because, I mean, it went around the world, as you said. These fur babies, they do weasel their way into our hearts, don't they? Yeah, he was very much the character, you know, in the car, flopping the old bicep out the window, you know. Checkpoint with me, Lisa Owen, 5 o'clock weekday evenings on RNZ National. Forecast from Met Service to midnight Northland is fine, apart from one or two morning showers at the west coast. Auckland to Taumaduui, also Coramandel and Bay of Plenty, fine. Gisbon and Hawks Bay, scattered rain clearing this morning, becoming fine this afternoon. Wairarapa, also Taupo, Taihape and Taranaki to Wellington. Areas a morning cloud with a shower or two for Wellington and southern Waira, otherwise fine. Nelson to Westland, Malbara, Canterbury and Otago except Cluther. Areas of morning cloud or fog for Canterbury, and the Buller Rangers, and there may be a shower there, otherwise fine with evening cloud for the west coast. Fjordland, Cluther and Southland, partly cloudy, isolated showers in Fjordland and along the south coast. Chatham Islands rain may be heavy with thunderstorms. Strong Sutherlies gale this afternoon and evening. In the main centres, Thamaki Makoto, Auckland is fine with southwesterlies fresh for a while this afternoon, a high of 20 degrees. Tauranga, fine, south-westerlies dying out this evening, 21. Kiri-Kiriro, Hamilton, fine, Sutherleys die out this evening. 20. Tefanganui Atara, Wellington, is fine apart from some cloud in the chance of a shower this morning. Sutherly's strong and exposed places early this morning, gradually dying out. 15. Or Tehahe Christchurch is fine, patches a morning fog though, northeasterlies from afternoon, 16 degrees, and Orti-Poti-Dinidon fine, light winds and a high of 19. It's almost nine minutes past seven. And you're listening to Morning Report with Corrin'an and Susie Ferguson. Well, after 80 days at the red COVID-19 setting, New Zealand is now back in orange, giving people the freedom to gather in unlimited numbers, stand at bars, or go to school without masks. Reactions on the streets of Auckland have ranged from nonplussed to relieved. Others, though, not so pleased. Didn't know that was the case, but if it's the orange traffic right, we're good with that. I mean, I'm a uni student, like at the moment, like it's been online which has stuck, you know? Like case numbers are like kind of doing like they're not shooting up anymore and like obviously there's people that we still need look out for you know but I feel like it could be good going to orange yeah. Are the clubs back? Yeah. Like dancing properly like oh. Oh no, they're just going to be like... Could be keen. I'm just back. Yeah. Like dancing properly. Like, oh. It could be, like, could be keen. I'm just glad it's finally happening. Things are back to normal now. Normal life. Makes me feel less safe. I think we've still got so many vulnerable people in our community. And we've still got so many people that are getting sick. And so many people still going to hospital every day. Yet we're moving down levels. With us now, the owner of Christchurch Nightclub Hyde, Mitch Ryder, Keora. Hi-a-Susie, how are you? Well, thank you, but how are you? Oh, ecstatic. Yeah, very, very happy. What did you do last night? Did you open for midnight? No, we didn't. Our first night of trad is tonight. And as well as Saturday, it's kind of an interesting weekend being Easter. It hasn't provided us enough time to apply for special licenses to go to our regular sort of 3 a.m. But nonetheless, we're extremely excited to get back to normal trading. I suppose it's going to be a slightly strange weekend. What sort of response are you expecting? Lots of people, lots of ponters coming in? Yeah, yeah, it's looking to be a slightly strange weekend. What sort of response are you expecting? Lots of people, lots of pointers coming in? Yeah, yeah, it's looking like a sell-out event this evening and also on Saturday. So, yeah, we're over the moon. It would be great for people to come together and dance. It's what we sort of cater to for. What sort of situation are you anticipating with people feeling safe? Do you think basically everyone who's going to go out to a nightclub will feel quite happy and we'll just carry on as normal? I mean, I can't speak for them, obviously, but I like to think that, I like to think that, you know, they've made their own health choices and they've protected themselves with the vaccine and they're, you know, they're ready to and they're ready to dance as safely as they can. What's the situation for your staff? Do they still have to wear masks? Yes, they do. The forward-facing staff do, which is all of them. So, yeah, they're more than happy with that. Okay, so they're going to be wearing masks, obviously people that you're dealing with won't be. Are you anticipating any communication difficulties around this? Obviously nightclubs are pretty loud and sometimes it can be quite hard to get your order heard at the bar. Yeah, that's an issue. We always have to deal with ordering drinks, as you can imagine. There's lots of the old get-a-br bro kind of lifting of the eyebrows to get attention and whatnot but it's just something we deal with on a nightly rotation Are your staff all happy that them wearing masks is going to be enough? Look again I mean all of our staff are extremely excited to get back. You know, we have spoken to them all over the last couple of days, any health concerns. We can certainly follow them into another hospitality business we have, but there's been no complaints from any of them. So, yeah, we're happy to proceed. I suppose it has been a long time coming. What have you been able to do, if anything, under red? Yeah, my business partner, Sam, and I had a laugh. We've been kind of laughing through the whole thing, really. I mean, we've only bought the nightclub just over to an half years ago. We spent two years of it, you know, basically in red. So it has been about, you know, catering to private events when the traffic light system and, you know and the level system is allowed for it. So that's been catering for the likes of 21st, 30th private events of that manner. How were you able to keep going? Because you wouldn't have had necessarily much of a buffer. Like you say, you only bought the place two and a half years ago. Yeah, I suppose it's a combination of things. Having a really good understanding of how our business works with our landlord who has been, or they have been amazing. And I suppose being as dynamic as we can, as a business, you know, being able to scale down, still being able to trade under certain parameters. So, yeah, it's been a lot of pivoting. Yeah, sure. And I suppose your landlord, were you able to work out some changes around rent and that kind of thing with them? Yeah, absolutely. I suppose I can't speak on my heart for other hospitality operators, but many hospitality operators that we know have needed to have very serious conversations with their landlords almost immediately when there was changes to the system and, yeah, thankfully our landlord's been very understanding, so it's been brilliant. Has it been frustrating? Of course it's been frustrating, but, you know, to a certain extent, we need to listen to what the experts say, and there's plenty of experts advising the government. So, you know, most of the time we've just been sitting back and agreeing, really. I think the latest situation over the last couple of weeks has been slightly frustrating because we couldn't wrap our head around to that. But patience has been a virtue here, and we're just ready to get back to it. Could there be a bit of a, you know, a double-edged sword here? Because you get to open up now and you get to trade, you know, we'll wait and see whether it's sort of in quotes back to normal or not. But is the other side of that that you may end up with staff who get sick and have to isolate and then you have to deal with that a few weeks down the line? Look, that's always a risk for anyone in business right now, I suppose. You know, a number of our staff have already, you know, had omelicron. So, I mean, it's just something we need to deal with to be fair. Look, thanks so much for talking to us this morning. That is Mitch Ryder there who owns Hyde, the nightclub in Christchurch. It is quarter past seven. A COVID modler at Otago University, Matthew Perry, is worried about a continuing rise in infections in Otago in South. And among those over 60, he's backed by the Southern District Health Board, which says case numbers are continuing to rise among some groups, including older people. Matthew Perry joins me now. Good morning. Hi, how are you? Very well. What's your evidence or your data showing for you at the moment, in particular, those older groups? So it's been inching up quite consistently for the last month or so in the sort of age group from 60 and above. And the hospitalisation rates? They've gone up as well, but they've levered out of late. But the worrying thing, I guess, in this case, is the daily numbers don't tell the full story because the hospitalisation risk is so much higher in the older age groups. It's really that's where the risk really is happening. So what do you think is happening here in terms of peaks and waves? Well, we've been stubbornly sort of close to our peak in the south where I live for quite some time now, two or three weeks. And that's, you know, it's been quite hard to figure out all the, reason for that. It's partly because of different regions have sort of had peaks. So, you know, cases behind, and even then Invercargo and sort of back to the need and again, there's also been movement between the age groups as we've been talking about. So it seems like it's going to persist for a while. And of course, coming into winter there's extra effects that occur there too, so people are going to spend more time inside. So is this a plateauing of the peak or has it come down to a bit of a long tail? It's come down to a long tail, but it's just coming off very, very slowly. So compared to other DHBs around the country, it's quite unusual. I think northern is similar and maybe west coast is still rising, but southern is a bit of an outlier is weather effective do you think um yeah we do have we do have a winter down here of course um it's been quite mild of late um but i guess that's one of the issues with moving to the orange setting is whether some of the restrictions being taken off um around indoor events and so on um that we might start seeing you know more more pressure on those numbers to go up. Yeah, well, I mean, Chris Hickens, the minister this morning, saying that, you know, not every school is going to have those ventilation systems, and he's suggesting just open the windows a little bit will help. Is that going to be sufficient? It probably wouldn't be so great down here, of course. I mean, I know classrooms tend to do that anyway, but that certainly would be an issue here. I mean, I know some schools are going to recommend or maybe even require masking still. I'm not quite sure how widespread that will be. I guess we'll wait and see after the holiday break, but that would be something that might mitigate that to some degree. So will you be modelling for, or what do you think your model will show from the impacts of these changes? Do you expect to see things tick up again? That's what I'm suspecting. So as I say, if you go back to the older age groups, 60 and above, there's already an upward trend in the daily case numbers. I was already concerned that it will continue with moving into winter. Of course, we've got waning vaccination effectiveness as well that factors into this and then now changes to the traffic light setting. So my sense is it's going to be a continued pressure on or increased transmission risk to the older age groups. And the threshold, the pressure on the health system has always got to be the number one factor here in terms of the government's decision making. Do you think, how do you think that's going to shape up? I mean, if there is more pressure on, they will be under pressure to presumably make some changes. That's true. So, I mean, in Southern, because although we've had a sustained peak, it hasn't been a very high peak, so I think we mentioned that naturalisation rates hasn't been unmanageable. I think from what I hear it's sort of at the sort of the upper end of what can be handled, so any continued increases will make things more difficult. Just finally, do you model for mask use, and are you worried that if we see some behavioural shifts with mask use, just as we relax things a little bit, people perhaps become a little bit less vigilant that that could be a problem? Yeah, that certainly factors in the models. It's unfortunately very hard to quantify exactly what that effect's going to be. As you ask more and more detailed questions of a model, you have to have more and more detailed information to go into it. So some of these things are a bit unknown, and the best we can do is look at other situations around the world, around New Zealand to sort of see what effect changes have had. But purely from epidemiological reasoning, we can suspect that reducing mask use is going to increase transmission. Indeed. All right. Thank you very much for that. Matthew Perry, COVID modeler at Atago University. Appreciate your time this morning. 20 minutes past seven. Latest traffic news into us here at RNZ. In Tamaki Macauro, Auckland, Henderson Valley Road closed between Great North Road and Smythe Road because of a police issue, we are told. The 141 and 142 bus routes are being detoured. Now, this is a total of 11 bus stops being missed, so do allow it for extra time and delays in that area there. And now to the central North Island desert road is closed between Rangipo and Wauru because of a serious crash there. Motorists should allow extra time for a detour. That's going via State Highway 49 and over to Tirafati the east coast. State Highway 35 closed all the way Tairafati, the East Coast, State Highway 35 closed all the way from Okitu, north of Gisborne, through to Pautaka. This is because of fallen trees between Gisperin and Tolligua Bay. State Highway 38 is also closed in Fraser Town at the intersection with Pakofai Road because of flooding. State Highway 2, also down to one lane south from Gisborne to Wairoa. It is 21 past 7. The cost of living is continuing to rise. Latest figures show food prices went up 7.6% in the year to the end of March. It is the largest increase in more than a decade. Prices for fruit and veggies went up 18%. A reporter Somia Balmirapati took to the streets of Newtown to find out just how much people are struggling. It's scary. It's scary. It's terrible. It is what it is. I'm not happy that it's now a challenge to feed yourself as well as house yourself and keep yourself warm at night in New Zealand. Annoying. I'm broken up as it is. Eat as little as it is. It's absolutely, I don't know how to describe that without swearing to be honest. And the items people say have hit their pockets the hardest? Meat, cheese, butter, flour, bread, grain and things that we are developing ourselves, you know, like dairy. why are we paying so much? The cost of vegetables is extreme, like $12 for a cauliflower or something, is like no cauliflower should cost that much. The biggest question, of course, what can be done about it? Taking the GST off fruit and veggie, so that would be a good thing to do, I think. Yeah, and I think, yeah, having that more competition in the supermarket. We've got to cut out the middleman, you know, from the farm to the consumer, because the middleman takes for the profit. It's not just one thing, but I think the government really needs to play a major part. Localised food systems and support urban farms and small- scale organic market gardening is definitely the way to do that. And food prices aren't the only things going up, so are interest rates. In an effort to control inflation, the Reserve Bank has hiked the official cash rate to 1.5%, warning more rises are on the way. Very scary for young families and people on basic wages and I'm just about to retire, so it's scary for me as well. But I know that the Reserve Bank is trying to do their best in terms of avoiding a recession, so who knows? It does make me a bit nervous as a homeowner. But, yeah, I don't know. I think a lot of people, now that the border restrictions of east and stuff, I think there's going to be a lot of people leave in New Zealand trying to go somewhere where it's more affordable to live, like Australia. 23 minutes past 7 now on RNZ National, a non-profit organisation that lends to struggling families, Ngaata Microfinance, says it's handling record requests for help. Its chief executive Natalie Vincent is with us. Morena? Morena. How has, I suppose, your client base, if you like, changed over the two years of the pandemic? What do you see now that you weren't seeing at the beginning? Yeah, that's a good question. I think that, well, for us, we've worked with low-income New Zealanders that have been struggling with unmanageable high-cost debt, and that was happening long before COVID or the rising cost of living that we're seeing now. So that's really just exacerbated things and compounded a whole lot of issues. So what we've started to see over the last couple of years is more people that perhaps weren't in that hardship stage prior, who are now finding themselves in hardship that have perhaps started borrowing, lending that has become unaffordable, and they've reached out for support from a financial mentoring service who has then come to us to see if we can help address some of that unmanageable debt. So we're seeing a new base of clients, I guess. Okay. What sort of numbers of people come to you? Well, interestingly, over the last few months, we have had staggering inquiries through our self-referral system on our website. We've been getting on average about 500 inquiries a month. Pre-COVID, we would probably get about 30. So it's phenomenal numbers of people reaching out for support, which is a great thing. We absolutely encourage that, and that's great to see. The problem is that our model relies on financial mentors to work alongside our clients and they're at capacity. So we're encouraging people to reach out for help. But if there's not enough support there for them, you know, we've got a real problem. So people, if they have already potentially taken out loans at the point that they come to you, are they in any kind of position to be able to pay them back? And are those like Loans shark loans? Yeah, that's, so the clients that come to us, we work with low-income New Zealanders, about 80% of our clients receive a benefit. And they have got into, usually when they come to us, they've got an average of about $18,000 of debt. And a portion of that is government debt. And the portion of that is government debt and the rest is high cost lending. So on average the interest rates are about 35% of what they're paying on that $18,000 worth of debt. And they have generally taken that out for what we're finding more and more lately is for essential living. It's not sort of over-umption of, you know, spending more than they want to on things that they don't need. It's actually people taking out debt to live, basically. So this is to put food on the table, to put clothes on their kids' backs? That's right, yeah. It's having to lend for things like whiteware or dental costs. Dental costs are a big one that come to us. Car repairs, basic things that, you know, you may have had a buffer and have had some money aside for. People do not have space in their budget to put aside a buffer for unexpected financial events. They're just not earning enough money. The benefits are just too low. People just cannot live on what they are receiving. So what needs to be done? Something? Yeah, a lot needs to be done. I mean, I know that the cost of living increase is a really complex issue, but for what we're concerned about, you know, a lot of people in New Zealand with this rising cost of living, it's potentially a lifestyle change, you know, tighten your belts, all those other sort of colloquial kind of terms of what they need to do. For the people that we work with, this is a survival issue. They're going backwards every week. I think the fairer futures just put out a report recently that a family with three children were going backwards by about $300 a week if you were living on a fixed low income. That is going to come crashing down pretty soon if we don't do something about raising benefits levels to a living wage, raising the minimum wage to a living wage and actually enabling people to live a life with dignity. Look, Namihi, thank you very much for joining us today. We're speaking there to Natalie. Oh, Natalie Vincent. Apologies. I'm having a few gremlins in my computer this morning. That was Natalie Vincent there from Ngatanga Microfinance. It's 28 past 7. An overseas recruitment campaign targeting intensive care nurses has lured just three people into jobs here since it launched two months ago. The $300,000 campaign was set up to entice New Zealand qualified critical care nurses working abroad to return home and help ease acute workforce shortages. Health Minister Andrew Little has told RNZ getting three jobs filled is a good result. Our political reporter, Anaka Smith, has more. The recruitment campaign aims to plug some of the holes in the country's critical care services. It went live in early February and, as of last Friday, 93 applications had been received and 22 of these referred to their preferred DHB for employment. Of these 22 referrals, just three are in jobs. Tanya Mitchell, chair of the College of Critical Care Nurses, says it's reassuring some Kiwi nurses have come home, but progress is far too slow. The concerning thing for me is that we've seen this pandemic evolve overseas for a couple of years. We've known that nursing prior to that is already at crisis point. So it does seem that it's taking a long time for this to be recognised in these active measures to try and increase our nursing numbers. Health Minister Andrew Little first spoke about offshore recruiting last November, but it took until February for the campaign to get off the ground. Two months in, he told RN said he's happy with the results. This is a campaign that's due to run through to the end of June, so I think that's a good result. Good progress so far. National's health spokesperson, Dr Shane Rretti, says Mr Little is dreaming if he thinks it's good progress. I think it's an appalling waste of taxpayer funds, I think it's mismanagement, and at the end of the day, it doesn't actually resolve our problem. Our problem was the critical resource is ICU nurses, and several months later and several hundred thousand dollars later, three new ICU nurses in employment does not fix that problem. A major independent report, ordered by the minister and released in February, found nurses are overworked and exhausted because of consistent understaffing. Tanya Mitchell says the report makes for a shocking read, but none of it is surprising. She says morale in intensive care nursing is particularly low right now. We've had a long time of working understaffed, and that is hard on nurses when they feel like they're not able to provide the level of care that they'd like to for the patients, that the patients aren't getting the best care that they need. RNZ put this front line fatigue to the minister who had this message for critical care nurses. We are getting more people and we're building more ICU spaces as well. So for those, for whom part of the pressure they're dealing with is just the work spaces that they're in. So my message to them is hold on. We are building the ICU nurse workforce as quickly as we can. Tanya Mitchell says ICU nurses have been holding on for years now. She says more staff, whether they're recruited on or offshore, can't come fast enough. It is 28 minutes to 8 now on morning report coming up before 8 o'clock here on RNZ National. We'll hear the latest from rain-drenched Wairoa and Tairafiti region. Also, some builders are describing as absurd delays of many weeks to get cancelled inspections. And the Easter weekend coming up, many will be hitting the trails for a tramp. We'll get the very latest advice from Doc. Kutaitai Thawu-Mu. Now, news headlines in Nicola Wright. The COVID-19 response minister isn't worried about schools dropping mask rules as the country shifts back to the orange traffic light setting. Schools have had high COVID rates in the Omicron outbreak, but orange means it will no longer be compulsory for students and staff to wear masks. The change has been criticised by epidemiologists. Chris Hipkins told Morning Report officials have looked closely at ventilation and deemed that opening doors and windows between lessons will be sufficient. A report on the impact of Omicron on cancer treatment is expected to show fewer patients were diagnosed with the disease. The Cancer Control Agency is today releasing a monitoring report covering January and February this year. Several district health boards have been doing only the most time critical cancer surgeries and diagnoses during the Omicron outbreak. Wairdor's Mayor says his district had a rough ride from the former cyclone Fili, but the worst has now passed, and river levels are dropping. Craig Little told Morning Report lots of slips started coming down last night, and he expects there will have been more through the night. He says many culverts were blocked and surrounding water reached about half a meter deep. He says he's expecting more road closures this morning and a big clean-up ahead. The man accused of the New York subway shootings been found and taken into custody. An intense police hunt had been underway for 62-year-old Frank James, who was arrested by two police officers on a Manhattan street. Ten of the almost 30 people injured remain in hospital. Part of Auckland's central motorway junction will close to motorists heading north over Easter weekend while a damaged joint on a bridge is repaired. Waka Kota, he says all northbound lanes on State Highway 1 between Simon Street and the State Highway 16 link will be closed from mid-morning today until 7 o'clock Saturday morning. It says the damaged joint doesn't pose an immediate safety risk, but it does need to be repaired as soon as possible. That's the news. The weather in the towns and cities today with Met Service, Kaitaya and Fangare have a sunny day in a high of 21. Auckland and Hamilton fine in 20. Tauranga and Fakataane fine, 21.

And you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Moscow has claimed more than 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered in the besieged port city of Maripo. Russian state television has released images of what it says. Were Marines giving themselves up? Mariupo Meir Vladombojchenko says Russian troops are resorting to chemical attacks. His speech is translated. The day before yesterday, Russian troops tried to use a chemical attack and drop chemical weapons to attack our soldiers. There are people who can testify in the villages. They could feel a taste of something. They could tell that something was happening around these villages. And these people in the villages, our boys and girls, started leaving those places. We need to have a specialized laboratory to investigate and find out what substance was used. Russians were saying that they were trying to use these chemical attacks because they can't manage to completely take our city. Meanwhile, more details are emerging around the attack at Kramatostk Station where 52 people died last weekend. They were civilians trying to leave for somewhere safe. Kramatorsk Mayor Alexander Gon Chorinko says he was at the station within minutes of the attack. His description of the rocket sounds like a cluster munition. It's difficult to explain and to describe. And so people without legs, hands, without, I saw one child, one boy on the railway platform without head. So about 38 people were killed in one second. It is already defined by our police and militaries. It's a type of rocket.u. And the rocket exploded over the railway station building over 10, 15 meters. And small things like cubes, they were flying everywhere. That was Kramatosk mayor, Alexander Goncharcharenko. It is 22 minutes to 8. Well, contractors are out assessing roads and getting a clearer picture of the damage after the remnants of cyclone Philly whipped up wild weather around Tairafati and Wairoa yesterday. RNZ reporter Jimmy Ellingham is with us now from Wairoa. Kiyohra, Jimmy. What's it looking like this morning? Kiyo'ra, Susie. What a difference a day makes. As they say yesterday, it was overcast, windy, and there was rain. This morning in Wairo, it is still overcast, there's a little bit of wind, but the rain has gone. You can see the aftermath of what happened yesterday, though, is pools of water on people's front lawns. The Wadr River is still running pretty high, but you can see if you drive over the bridge and the town how high that was yesterday. So today, a big effort and cleanup will be required. Now, you were up in Gisborne yesterday from memory. So that drive down the coast, what was it like? From Gisbon to Wai Loh this morning, it wasn't as bad as what I thought it might be. There were places where there were signs of debris and where water had been on the road where you can see the leftover leaves and branches and that sort of thing. There was one small area where the road was down to one lane because of a slip and there were a few trees hanging over the road. But it wasn't looking as bad as what I thought it might. There was a bit of rain between Gisbon and Widera and the ranges. But apart from that, it was clear and a pretty good drive. And the region as a whole has had, it's kind of not been hammered in the same way as perhaps people thought it might, quite variable in terms of how much rain people were getting. Very much so. In Gisbon yesterday, it was a day of heavy rain, but last night it was perhaps the wind that was the strongest feature of the weather. But having a look at the rain gauges from the Gisbon District Council, at Gisbon Airport, about 58 mills were recorded in the day till now, where some other rain gauges up the coast were recording the likes of East Cape Lighthouse 150 mils, to Puiah, which is not too far from Tokomaru Bay, 114. And when I was driving yesterday, I drove up to Tolliga Bay and then Takamaru Bay, and the drive back to Gisbon, the rain was very heavy. And State Hawaii 35, which has been closed since last night was becoming a little bit of a river bears there was also a tree fell across the road at one point and there were more that fell later hence the road being closed yeah and certainly we were talking earlier on to waka kothahi they're saying that they will hopefully get all of those trees and debris and the like cleared for people to be able to use today and indeed over Easter. But, you know, it's been, yet again, this area has been hit and more of a clean-up to happen again. Yes, yes, only three weeks after the last one. And the wider mayor, Craig Little, says that those efforts will start today. Talking to the tie that's civil defence people earlier, they were having a meeting scheduled for about 8 a.m. this morning with all the people from across the region, just so people can report in and see what the damages, in particular towns and parts of that district so they can assess what's needed, get that clean-up begun. And the emergency management minister, Kerry Allen Allen is due to visit the region today as well. Namahy, thank you very much for the update. That's Jimmy Allingham our reporter who is in Wairoa this morning. It's 19 minutes to 8. Well some economists are describing the reserve bank's 50 basis point rise to the official cash rate yesterday as an overreaction. Kelvin Davidson, the chief property economist at CoreLogic, New Zealand, says the change will have a profound effect on mortgage rates. He joins us now. Good morning. Good morning. Look, clearly we've got an inflation problem. This strategy of going hard now would make some sense, doesn't it? Yeah, I think it does. And the key problem is inflation expectations. So it's not just what's happening to inflation now, but it's what people think might happen. And if they think prices are going to rise quickly in future, they start to push up their prices now. They bargain for higher wages, and it becomes a bit self-reinforcing. So I think it's really trying to rein in those expectations, but it does, of course, have implications for mortgage rates right now. Let's help people out a bit here in terms of what the bank is trying to do. I mean, it can't fix the supply problems that have caused inflation, but it can take out demand. So this is all about stifling demand, which is very strong, right? Yeah, that's right. And I suppose that's been a positive, really, of the COVID experience so far. It's actually our domestic economy has held up recently well. You've got to acknowledge those issues in certain sectors, but overall we've done okay. And construction's been really hot. So, yeah, demand is pretty strong. People have not had much incentive to have money in the banks that have been spending on other things. And it's kind of propped up the economy, but it does feed through to inflation, especially when you have restrictions on the supply side. I mean, it's a pretty blunt tool, isn't it? But it's all they've got, I suppose. So let's look at what this will do in terms of mortgage rates and the extra people will be paying. They'll have less money in their pocket because they'll have to spend more on their mortgages. That means they can spend on less things and it reduces demand, right? So let's take a two-year fixed rate, which is sort of right smack in the middle there. I'm looking at the rates at the moment, and, you know, 5% maybe, if you're lucky, it's going to go higher, isn't it? Yep, yeah, I think probably bank on, sorry, bad pun there, but perhaps assume a peak of around that 6% mark, and that's where most people are anticipating. So there's more to go in terms of the official cash rate, but there's already been such a big pass through to mortgage rates that the future increases in interest rates or mortgage rates that is might be a bit smaller. But there's still more to come, and probably about 6% is what you're saying. So what you're saying is that the banks had anticipated these moves earlier, so the wholesale interest rates had already increased, they'd already hiked them. So you're not going to perhaps see the full extent of it, but maybe peak 6%. So what does that mean for someone who's thinking of fixing now? Well, yeah, it comes down the individual strategy, of course. Probably there are lag defects, you know, it's important to point out a lot of people won't have seen much impact at all yet because they fixed a year ago or two years ago and they've yet to come up to the end of their current deal. So it does have lagged effects, and there's about 50% of loans currently fixed in New Zealand but due to refinance in the next 12 months. So there is a lag defect, and people will have to face up to it over the next year. There's nowhere to run, though, right? Looking at the rates, say, for some of the banks, I mean, they're quite flat. It's not like you've got, you can go to floating and try and write it out or go to longer term, can you? Oh, and like I say, it comes down to individual strategy, but most people are thinking the sweet spot right now is around that one or two you've fixed because I suppose there's a chance further out that if you fix for four or five years, by then interest rates have started to come back down again. We hope so. Yeah, you only know the strategy in hindsight, but yeah. We should point out that I mean, we're still at record lows aren't we, near record lows. We're moving back to a normal neutral position. It's interesting that we're making that move back, aren't we, near record lows? We're moving back to a normal, neutral position. It's interesting that we're making that move back to neutral, normal, but it is already having quite an impact on the housing market. So what do you think is going to happen there? We're going to see house prices continue to come off. Yeah, well, I think the big issue here is that it's, they're still low by past standards, but it's where they've come from. They were so low to start with, the proportional change for people is quite large, and I think psychologically a generation of borrowers have never seen interest rates go up. Now they're thinking what, they can actually go up as well as down. So there's a mindset change here going on, and so, yeah, the impact is pretty large for the housing market. We're already seeing it. As I say, there's probably a bit of a lagged impact here, so we're probably not seeing full impact just yet. Certainly house prices have fallen a bit in the past few months. There's probably a bit more to go in certain areas. I think it's probably patchy. There's this idea that we can see something of a soft landing because unemployment's still low, but some areas will perform worse than others. And so I think there is scope for falls in some parts of the country and rises elsewhere. So a bit patchy. We're seeing it come through already and there's more to come. But as you're saying earlier, just to finish some good news for, I suppose, for those who have got money in the bank, they should start to see those deposit rates increase in line with mortgage rates. There will be some increases. I mean, the history tells you that probably the increases in deposit rates are smaller than the increases in lending rates, but certainly there should be some pass through there and good news for savers, but again, they'll still be low, so people will be looking for other asset classes as well. But all else equal, good news for those savers. Calvin Davidson, thank you very much, the Chief Property Economist at CoreLogic, New Zealand, 13 minutes to 8. Well, some builders are threatening to bypass council inspections because they simply can't afford to wait weeks amid absurd delays in getting staff on site. Inspections in Christchurch are taking about seven weeks, adding another layer of complexity to the build process and costing builders and their clients in the process. The registered master builders association says it's time for central government to step up. Emma Hatton reports. Peter DeGau of Home Trends Builders in Christchurch tried to block two pre-roof inspections earlier this week, but there was no availability until early June. He's already dealing with building material delays and rising costs. This will probably be the final nail in the coffin for most builders, and it'll single-handedly curb any new building activity in Christchurch. A build or major renovation has anywhere between eight and 12 inspections, with the next one only able to be booked once the first one has been signed off. Mr DeGar says the current delays are extrapolating build times out much longer than they need to be and adding tens of thousands of dollars to the building's costs. So an ordinary home build would normally take 20, 25 weeks, let's say we're now out to 98, 100 odd weeks if you include holidays and things like that. So it's making the bill time closer to two years rather than six months. He says builders are now left with only two options. One is to either comply with these delays and probably face financial ruin. And if they don't comply, the second option is to ignore the inspections, go ahead, book them as you can, but just go ahead and build the house anyway. The chances are you won't get co-compliance at the end. He has advised the council's building consenting head that if inspectors were unable to front up within a reasonable and normal time frame, his builders would take lots of photos and carry on regardless. David Kelly, the head of the Master Builders Association, says builders cannot sustain lengthy delays. So there are very severe cash flow problems in the industry right now, and this is making it worse. So this is when builders go broke, and this is when homeowners don't get their homes built on time and well. He says the consenting and inspection process has been problematic for years, and it's now time for central government to step in and fix it. At the current level of consenting, for every additional week on average, that there are delays in final completion that cost New Zealand $100 million. That's a lot of money. So for a much smaller amount, we believe we could fix the system, introduce technology at the consenting, the front end and through the inspection process. That would be money returned many times over. The Christchurch City Council says wait times were longer because demand was exceeding capacity and the council had taken on contractors and additional inspectors, as well as rolling out virtual inspection technology. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment began a review into the building consent system last year, but a final report is yet to be published. It's 10 minutes 8. You're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National with Susie Ferguson and Corrin Dan. Now let's look at the traffic across the country. There's quite a bit to report. Auckland, Henderson Valley Road is closed between Great North Road and Smyth Road. This is due to a police issue. The 141 and 142 bus routes are being deterred. A total of 11 bus stops are being missed. Motorists should allow extra time for delays in that area. Central North Island, the desert road, is closed between Rangipo and Wa'uru. This is due to a serious crash, and motorists should allow extra time for a detour via State Highway 49 there. Now, to the east coast, State Highway 35 is closed all the way from Oquitou, north of Gisbon, through to Portaka. This is due to fallen trees between Gisbon and Tologe Bay. And State Highway 38 is also closed in Fraser Town at the intersection with Pauqua Road due to flooding. State Highway 2 is down to one lane from Gisbon to Waira and in Wellington. One lane is blocked on State Highway 2 between the Naurang Interchange and Potoni due to a crash. So do take care there as well. It is nine minutes to eight. Lots of you getting in touch with us this morning, 2101 or indeed morning report at RNZ.com.nz. With your corero on masks under the orange setting. This teacher getting in touch to say at least with a mask requirement we had support, and now we don't. Will has text to say we know from experience that without a government mandate secondary students refuse to wear masks. No matter what the school rules, watch teachers drop like flies next term. Jacob emailed to say, I'm shocked and disappointed at the decision to remove the requirement for masks and schools. My mother lives with and looks after several of my school age nieces and nephews. She's not alone. Thousands of other older vulnerable people live in households with school-age children. They have no choice now but to be at greater risk of catching COVID and dying due to this rule change. Susan has texted in to say, as a 60-year-old, I agree with the move to Orange. The younger generations did what was asked to help protect the older and those immune compromised. Now, it's our turn to accept greater freedoms and if we're worried to take personal responsibility to keep ourselves safe. This listener has a suggestion for Mr. Hapkins' confusion at the announcement. Certainly he was pretty confused about where you did and did not need a mask. He says, I feel Hipkins is suffering from COVID brain. I notice I have been two since recovering a month ago. And that is that latest one in On 2101 to us here at RNZ National. Yes, brain fog. It is a problem when it comes to COVID, that's for sure. Now, let us go to the long Easter weekend. It's almost upon us. Many people are keen to get away. And Easter, of course, a popular time for tramping. With us now is Director of Heritage and Visitors for the Department of Conservation. Tim Bamford. Kiora good morning. At a matter, Susie. How are you? And well, thank you. But I guess you will be hoping, especially with the orange traffic light, that lots of people will be getting out and about this weekend. Yeah, absolutely. It's looking like a great Easter weekend with lots of New Zealanders and our Australian friends and families planning to get into the outdoors. So it should be a busy one as we move into winter. It's sort of one of the last great weekends for out and about. Yeah, weather forecast. People, of course, need to check that sort of thing as well as their gear before they head out. Absolutely. The weather is looking very well across the country over Easter weekend with some places fine and others. Experiencing wind and rain is probably a pretty typical Easter weekend. You can experience four seasons in a weekend or a day, so it is worth keeping a close eye on the weather and being ready to adapt and change plans if needed. And as you say, tell someone where you're going, check the weather regularly before you go. And as the days are getting shorter, we also need to be a lot more prepared when going into the outdoors compared with the summer in regards to getting caught outside and also getting cold. We should talk specifically about Rupeu, Central North Island. Because of that situation with the tremors and the crater lake heating, this two-kilometer exclusion zone, is that going to curtail people's plans? Yes, as you say, there is currently volcanic unrest at her pay-hoo. The exclusion zone, that's two kilometres in a circle around from the crater lake, is there to indicate the area of high volcanic risk at present time, so don't go into the exclusion zone. There aren't you need dock huts or club lodges within the exclusion zone, and there's lots of other experiences around Rupeu and Tongredo without being in the exclusion zone. And so, for example, the Tonguedero crossing is unconnected with the current volcanic risk, and people can still walk around the mountain track but just minimize their time in the Lahara paths which are essentially the main rivers coming off the mountain. Okay and you were mentioning there that the huts and lodges are outside that zone so that's pretty good but how are the hut bookings? Is it pretty busy at the moment or where would be a good place to go if you're looking for a last minute? There's strong interest in great walks and serviced huts. So compared to Easter last year booking for great walks are up 9% and bookings for our bookable huts are up comparatively as well. The most popular great walks are Abel Tasman and Fungaui Journey over Easter, and the busiest serviced huts are the pinnacles and the Corramandal, the Mueller and the Anglis huts. However, some huts still have beds available, for example, Powell Hut, Holly Hut, and Nidia Lodge, and also over the school holidays, some great walk tracks, and the majority of serviced huts have beds available especially in midweek so if you're looking for an outstanding experience with your kids, check online. Sounds good, thank you very much for joining us. Tim Bamford there from the Department of Conservation. It's three minutes to wait. Here's one for the car lovers. Tonight, New Zealand is staging the first leg of the annual Hot Wheels Legends Tour. This is a global search for the best custom car in the eyes of toy maker Mattel. The prize for the global winner, their car will be immortalised in toy form and sold to children and collectors around the world. Among those entered in the virtual competition, which will be streamed from, I think, six tonight, Pukukoi Builder and proud Mazda owner, Steve Ellicott, who joins us now. Good morning, Steve. And how's it again? Very well. Tell us a little bit about your Mazda, quite impressive from what I've seen of the photos. Thanks very much. It's 1974. 808 wagon, X 363 replica pretty much And what have you done to it? So to give people a sense of how you've Do we still say pimped it up? Is that the term from the old TV show? Yeah, I suppose if you want to go that way, yeah. It has a 30m turbo. It's got a It a full custom chassis, nine-inch diff and force gearbox, it's nine second quarter miles, and it's 800 horsepower at the tyre. And the colour and the look of it? It's just custom metallic, only goldy sort of a colour It's had extensive panel and paint work done to it Yeah no it looks pretty good Okay so this competition If you win you'd be like a little A car that you know Your kids could have on the mantelpiece Yeah It's what got me into entering I've got a three-year-old And he would love to play with bad car You know Oh, that'd be fantastic Wouldn't it? I wonder in this day and age With climate change and things coming You might have some competition Any electric cars in the mix, do you think? Well, yes, possibly Yes, and so when were you find out, do you know? It's live at 6 o'clock tonight. Oh, you'll literally find out tonight whether you win or are in the... Yeah, well, in the running year. Oh, fantastic. Hey, well, good luck with that, Steve. Much appreciated Steve in the running for it to be a Hot Wheels Legends tour. Good morning, New Zealand. You're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. A fine one across the Motu called Susie Ferguson. At the Maria Correndantene, in this hour, the government may have moved us into orange, but southern health officials are worried about a rise in Omicron cases among the over-60s. East Coast communities face more repair work as the deluge delivered by ex-cyclin Philly clears. Also before known, we're joined by outgoing Labor MP, Lewis O'Wall, who will today give her valedictory speech in Parliament. Staff Taranaki is hoping for a quick bounce back from COVID, and it might not be Friday, but we'll cross the ditch and hear from our Australian correspondent. RNZ News at 8. Good morning. I'm Nicola Wright. The COVID-19 response minister is defending the decision to drop the mask mandate for schools. Masks will no longer be compulsory in schools, even though there have been high transmission rates between students. The change has been criticised by epidemiologists. The Minister Chris Hipkins told Morning Report that opening doors and windows between lessons will be sufficient for ventilation. We've looked at this really closely. So if you've got the doors in the windows open in a classroom, then the air will replenish about 30 to 60 times in an hour. An air cleaner will replenish the year about three times in an hour. Yesterday, Mr Hipkins wrongly said mask mandates had been removed in transport and retail, and he says he made the mistake by misreading his notes. A COVID modler is warning that the orange traffic light setting poses a significant risk in Otago in Southland. Otago University Senior Lecturer Matthew Perry says the southern region has the second highest daily case numbers by population, and its hospitalisation risk is going University Senior Lecturer Matthew Perry says the southern region has the second highest daily case numbers by population and its hospitalisation risk is going up. He says that's because infections are increasing among people aged 60 and over. Matthew Perry says the easing of face mask requirements will raise the risk of transmission and people will be spending more time gathered indoors during the winter. The storm that blasted the east coast of the North Island yesterday spun off by Cyclone Philly is over. A Met Service meteorologist Daniel Corrigan told morning report it was a major deluge, especially coming on top of widespread flooding inside Arfizi three weeks earlier. The hardest hit area was around East Cape and Gistran District Council rain gauges around East Cape recorded 200 millimetres of rain between Tuesday evening and midnight last night, which is an extraordinary amount of rain to fall within that time. Daniel Corrigan says 50mmes of rain fell in that area within just two hours between 10 o'clock and midday yesterday. Wydaw's Mayor Craig Little says the storm came in hard and fast, but the worst is over. He says river levels are dropping and the rain has eased. Mr Little says many culverts were blocked and surrounding water reached about half a meter deep. He's expecting more road closures this morning and a big clean-up ahead. And Waka-Korthahi contractors have been working since first light to clear several state highways blocked by fallen trees. Spokesperson Helen Harris told Morning Report the agency is prioritising the highways because Eastland contractors need access to restore power to outlying communities. We have crews that are going north and south to open the roads. I just would say that some of the trees are, you know, there are multiple trees and they are big trees that have come down and they are blocking the whole network. Helen Harris says Waka Kotahi had to close the road between Okitu north of Gisbon and Portaka last night. State Highway 38 is closed and State Highway 2 between Gisbon and Wairoa is down to one lane. South African President Cyril Ramiposa has described severe floods in Kwa Zulu-Natal province as a catastrophe of enormous proportions. More than 250 people have died. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka reports. Efforts are continuing to try to locate people who have been reported missing. Search teams report being overwhelmed. Bridges and roads have been swept away and homes buried under the deluge in the worst storm in decades. Hundreds of people have been left without food and shelter and several areas are without water and power. Durban, sub-Saharan Africa's largest port, is the worst affected. Shipping there has been suspended. Mr Ramaposa said the province would be declared an official disaster area to allow the national government to redirect more resources. The New York subway shooting suspect is in custody after being arrested by two police officers on a Manhattan street. An intense police hunt had been underway for 62-year-old Frank James. New York Mayor Eric Adams made a statement via video link as he remains in quarantine with COVID. My fellow New Yorkers, we got it. I cannot thank the New York City Police Department, enough, our federal agents, our state police, our first responders and I want to thank every day of Yorkers who help those passengers who were injured. 33 shots, but less than 30 hours later, we're able to say, we got them. 29 people were injured and 10 remain in hospital, but no victims suffered life-threatening injuries. The RSA is seeking assurances military personnel being sent to Europe to assist the Allied effort for Ukraine will get appropriate support in the future. New Zealand has sent a Hercules aircraft along with a 50 strong support team to the United Kingdom. It already has intelligence staff working in Europe. Kingdom. It already has intelligence staff working in Europe. RSA national president, B.J. Clark, says only personnel who've worked on some operations qualify for ongoing veterans support. Mr. Clark says that creates two classes of veterans and means many service people are exposed to trauma in their duties but remain ineligible for support. He calls it a national shame and has written to the chief of the Defence Force. A report into the impact of Omicron on cancer treatment is expected to show fewer patients were diagnosed with the disease. The Cancer Control Agency is today releasing a monitoring report covering January and February this year. Several district health boards have been doing only the most time-crit critical cancer surgeries and diagnoses during the Omicron outbreak. That is expected to be reflected in the cancer treatment numbers but is likely to vary by DHB. That's the news. With sport, here's Barry Guy. Wellington Phoenix coach Ufuk-Tale says they put themselves in a strong position before heading back to New Zealand and his team can't wait to play in front of the home fans. The Phoenix beat bottom of the table, Perth, Glory 1-0 in Sydney last night to climb to fifth on the A-League ladder. Three points is massive for us, you know, moving forward towards the back end of the season. The boys will be pretty excited heading to New Zealand and playing a couple of games over there. I think the boys that are injured will probably even put their hand up to play in these next couple of games, which is a good thing. The Phoenix, who hosts Central Coast and Wellington on Sunday, just a point behind fourth-placed Adelaide, who have played two more games. Meanwhile, IAC's boss, Eric Ten Haag, is on the brink of being confirmed as Manchester United's new manager. United say no deal is being done, but reports in the Netherlands suggest an agreement and principle is in place. Andrew McDonald has been appointed as Australia's men's cricket coach in all three formats for the next four years after guiding the team to a test series victory in Pakistan in a caretaker role. McDonald had served as an assistant under Justin Langer since 2019. And former black cap, Daniel Vittori, will take over as Birmingham Phoenix coach following McDonald's appointment. Nepal New Zealand boss, Jenny Wiley says the orange light setting should relieve some financial pressure on the A&Z premiership teams. The impact of the pandemic has continued this season with the first five rounds being restricted to crowds of 100 and then 200 people while this is although some franchises have been creative for most staying afloat has been a big strain. It has been probably the hardest year yet in terms of the financial impact but also the impact on the welfare of players management and umpires as well because everyone is on tender hooks this does provide some light at the welfare of players, management and umpires as well, because everyone is on tender hooks, this does provide some light at the end of the tunnel.

Fjordland, Clutha and Southland partly cloudy, isolated showers in Fjordland and along the south coast, mainly this evening. Chatham Islands rain and it may be heavy, easing this evening. Gale, southeasterlies gradually turned southwest during the day. In the main centres, Auckland is fine, southwesternies fresh for a while this afternoon and a high of 20 degrees. Taugunga fine, southwesterlies dying out this evening, 21. Hamilton fine, Sutherleys die out this evening, 20. Wellington fine apart from some cloud in the chance of a shower this morning. Sutherley's strong and exposed places early on, gradually dying out. 15. Christchurch, fine but with patches of fog this morning. North Easterlies from afternoon, 16. And Deneiden Fine light winds in a high of 19. You're listening to RNZ National. It's 10 past 8. And you're listening to Morning Report with Corrindan and Susie Ferguson. Well, the country's woken up in the orange COVID setting this morning, just in time for the long Easter weekend. But a COVID modler is warning that the new setting poses a significant risk in Otago and Southland. Otago University senior lecturer Matthew Parry told us earlier on Morning Reports that the southern region has the second highest daily case numbers by population and its hospitalisation risk is going up. So it's been inching up quite consistently for the last month or so in the sort of age group from 60 and above. So it seems like it's going to persist for a while. He's backed by the Southern District Health Board. The chief executive of Southland-wide community health provider Nakeetamā, Matorana Poundamu, is Tracy Wright Tafa, and she is with us now. Kiyora? Yorra, how are you today? Well, thank you. But you've just been listening there to the moddler. What is your view in terms of what you're seeing? Yes, well, I think orange for us means move forward with absolute care. So for one, I'm going to continue to wear my mask and sanitise and do a little bit of social distancing because our workload is extremely busy at the moment. I think it's fair to say that we might be moving through the eye of the storm of COVID. Of course, we got a little bit later than most of the country, but our statistics show that we're still on a fairly fast-paced, you know, piece of work at this stage. That description of wearing your mask and sanitising and social distancing sounds to me very much like you're going to continue to live as if you were in red. Is that the case? Well, I think all care. I mean, we're an 88 strong workforce in our agency. And at any one time at present, we've got about 15 to 20 percent of staff off with COVID. We're an essential frontline service. So we're taking all care. The people that we're engaging with, obviously, are people who are isolating because of COVID or considering that they're at risk. So I was just looking at some stats, and interestingly, you know, we've done 542 food parcels in the last eight weeks, but 66% of those were in the last four weeks. So, you know, we're still busy. Yeah, it's pretty full on. Does it feel quite strange to be inundated and, like you say, to be in that eye of the storm after New Zealand and indeed Southland avoiding COVID for so long? Well, I think, you know, for almost a couple of years, we were on tender hooks waiting for it to rise, and that can create a level of years, we were on tender hooks waiting for it to arrive. And that can create a level of anxiety and stress just from a planning point of view, from a well-being point of view. You know, mentally, I guess, you're sort of prepared, you're always about to. So you've got all the safety measures that you're following and putting in place for something that you know is on its way but hasn't arrived. So when it got here, you know, we quite literally threw ourselves into that front line doing lots of things like food and fruit and veggie parcels, medication scripts, medical GP triaging, well-being phone calls, you know, a whole raft of things. So we don't know. We've gone from 25 referrals a day last week to averaging it's 16 referrals this week. So at any one time, we're working with about 1,100 people who are either sick with COVID, home isolating, or are caring for somebody who's unwell. So it's busy days still for us. And for people who are still able to be out and about who are not in isolation, perhaps some who've already had COVID, the orange setting, do you think that means they're going to kind of ease off on some of the things that have helped to keep the community safe? I think it's very much relevant to, you know, who you are in ages and stages of life. I know that our co-mato are elderly are quite anxious to reconnect with one another because many of them live alone and are at risk of feeling lonely and or depression. But they're very, very careful about what they're doing and how they're doing it. The Rangatahi, the younger generation, are saying, just let me get back out there and get into the things that we want to do sports and pro-social activities and things like that. So I think it's families. I think it's parakeki. I think it's the adults and the mums and dads who are saying, I think we still need to have all care here at the moment. But I do believe there's an element of being COVID over. People are over it, wanting a return back to whatever the new normal looks like for them. But I think really what's on the forefront of people's mind as well as COVID is we're coming into Easter, a little bit of respite time and just to be with our family. So even though there are providers like ourselves who are still working seven days a week, you know, I can sense that people are just, you know, hanging out for a break. People are hanging out for a break, absolutely. But how concerned are you about people coming to see family or coming to be tourists in their own country and in their own backyard of Otago and Southland over the next few days, over the school holidays as well, and what that might mean for you a few weeks down the line? Yeah, well, we are concerned about that and so we are asking families and individuals to still take all care, even in orange. I mean, orange is kind of like, you know, it's a sign, it's a signal, it's an indicator that we're moving through this beast called COVID, the virus, but we're still asking people to be sensible and to think about what they're doing and we're here to support them with that. We can distribute free rats and masks and other things like that to help people plan for events that they want to be a part of. But we obviously know that, you know, in a couple of weeks to come or less, that we'll probably have more staff off. It's just how it is and we've got to get through it. So we're maintaining a positive vibe about it, but we're also being careful. Yeah, positive vibe, which is essential, I guess, in your line of work. But also this, I mean, there is stress and strain that comes along with that. How are your staff coping with dealing with all that goes with COVID? Yeah, I guess we've put in place measures like very, you know, rigorous screening. And so we ask all the questions, you know, how are you feeling today? Have you been anywhere of interest? Is there anything that, you know, you want to tell us just so we can, you know, know, know what stream we're putting people into? We have a green stream and a red stream just to make sure that we're managing, you know, our working environment as safely as possible. But, you know, we have been anxious, mainly because we take very seriously our roles as essential workers at the front line. And when we start going down, we're worrying about our community because that's the role we're in. We're there to help and support and provide information, advice and access to services. So it's really important that we look after ourselves. And so self-care is something I talk about with my team all the time. And also just recognizing that they are in a bit of a pressure cooker, because we're doing this work on top of everything else we do. So, you know, we have to look after the well-being of our staff. And I think that Southland has a good reputation for doing that. We're a bit of an ecosystem. We all interconnected as agencies and their emergency response planning. So we can lean in where someone else might need to take a break because we know that they'll lean in for us if we're under the pump. So Southland's a good place to be to work collectively and collaboratively like that. Namihi, thank you very much for your koreiro. That is Tracy Wright-ffa, Chief Executive of Nakeet Maturanga Pounamu. It is 17 minutes past eight. Well, after red warnings and dire weather forecasts Taerafti and the Wairo District are waking up to a pretty calm morning after the edge of X-Sightline fairly hit the region yesterday. Lillian Tahaou Ward is the Tokomaru Bay based civil defence fairly hit the region yesterday. Lillian Tahoe Ward is the Tokomaru Bay-based civil defence coordinator. Hi-a-Lillian. Morning from Tokomari. Love to have you on the show. Just give us an update. How did you fare overnight? How is everyone feeling? Well, the weather that we were expecting didn't really come, which was a good thing. And this morning, all reports from around Tokomaru Bay, everyone is fine. They're glad to wake up. The sea's no longer roaring. It's no longer raining, and the wind has died down. What sort of damage have you experienced? So the water, the rivers, did they cause any issues with roads, slips and bridges? So throughout Nātipara Paro we have road closures. We've got power lines down. Phone, cell phone towers are down. Good old O22 always works for Lillian. But yeah, we've weathered the storm and we've come out pretty all right at the other end. Nobody's had to evacuate or any homes affected, do you know of? No homes affected in Tokomaru. We did have some Fano evacuate yesterday just as a precaution because they live by the sea or by rivers. But yes, no, we're so thankful that the weather has gone and we can take another look at trying to clean up. Well, I was going to ask about that clean up. So what have you got on terms of debris and that sort of thing that's come down on your beaches and your rivers? Yep, so there was one stream that was causing some concern yesterday that became a raging torrent and threatened two, three properties. However, one of our local contractors was Johnny on the spot. He spent about four hours last night clearing that so that our residents could sleep safely and know they weren't going to float out into sea. And I understand he's back on the road just checking this morning and clearing the debris that came down overnight. Fantastic, Lilian, well, I hope you have a good Easter at a bit of a break, some reasonable weather, hopefully for a little bit anyway, to take stock. Lillian Tahoe Ward is the Tokomaru Bay-based civil defence coordinator. It's 20 minutes past eight. A little bit of updating on the travel news this morning. Tamaki Macauro, Auckland, Henderson Valley Road closed between Great North Road and Smyth Road because of a police issue. The 141 and 142 bus routes are being detoured and that's a total of 11 bus stops being missed out, so do allow extra time for delays in that area. In the central North Island this morning, the desert road closed between Rangipo and Waioru after a truck rolled around midnight. The truck driver was critically injured there. The road is expected to be shut for several more hours as the truck is removed from the scene. And you're just hearing about the east coast over there in Tai Raffiti. State Highway 35 closed all the way from Okitu, that's north of Gisburn, through to Potaka, due to fallen trees between Gisborne and Tolligua Bay, also State Highway 38, shut in Fraser Town at the intersection with Pakofai Road because of flooding and State Highway 2 down to one lane south from Gisburn to Wairoa. It is 21 minutes past 8. Well, with Easter weekend approaching, the police are asking drivers to slow down and be patient over the break. Eight people died on the roads last year in what was Altearoa, New Zealand's deadliest Easter in a decade. Superintendent Steve Grellia's director of the National Road Policing Center. He joins us now. Good morning. Good morning, Carl. Okay, what is the strategy for this weekend? There might be some people who perhaps haven't hit the open road for a while. What is the thinking? Yeah. Yeah, look, I think it's with any long weekend that we get. We see a lot of people on our roads, and quite rightly. We want people to go and have their holidays with their families and friends, and so you can understand the attraction there. It's just that what we're asking for all people on their own to do. It's a safe way to put your seatbelt on. You know, don't be influenced by alcohol, drugs or fatigue. You know, don't use your cell phone while you're driving. And, of course, what's the speed? You know, drive to the conditions. And I've just heard Susie speak this now on the East Coast. And, you know, they're really, really bad conditions. And accordingly've just heard Susie speak this now and are happening on the East Coast. And, you know, they're really, really bad conditions and accordingly people should probably, in those times in conditions, be thinking about delaying their travel or being extremely careful while they're on the road. What sort of a police presence will be out and about over the weekend? Yeah, yeah, well, we'll be out and about absolutely being visible. We're trying to be a little bit unpredictable and where we're going to be so that people don't manage to sort of guess where we're going to be. That defeats the purpose. But we want to be out there in numbers as well. And just making sure that people are doing the right things, you know. It's really important. When you think about the trauma related with crashes across this country, and, you know, had 320 people lose their lives last year, it just doesn't seem to be getting any better. But both themes are extraordinary, and now people have to put up with some amazing things that they have to see and experience at those scenes. And now that's really retouch on them psychologically too. That's not something we want to have to do as a cease to break or any day, to be fair, but we will do our job because that is our job, unfortunately. Are there particular sort of black spot areas that you're worried about? Look, in a local level, every part of the country has those parts of the network that are more problematic than others. And, of course, that's a cross-agency response. You know, the council's Wahutahi. They do a great job in identifying those places and dealing with both. But that's in conjunction with police. We've got to have really visible police enforcement to help with that problem too. So a last bit of advice for motorists heading out, particularly those who maybe haven't hit the roads for a while. What would that be in terms of, I suppose, you know, make sure your car's up to scratch as well? Well, yeah, that's one that we actually, people don't talk about a lot, isn't it? It is the warrant of fitness, and your tyres especially. We are seeing a bit of a trend in terms of tyres being causative in crashes. But at the day, just be calm when you're driving, you know. Take the time to get there plan ahead maybe put a little bit earlier or give an extra day from the boss so that you can come back a day later avoid the congestion and all the impatience we want people to be calm make better decisions on the road and get home and just basically survive the drive absolutely put on a nice R&Z podcast or something, you know, just to chill out and have a nice quiet drive. Superintended. It sounds like a plant to me. Absolutely. Steve Greeley, thank you very much, Director of the National Road Policing Centre. It is 24 minutes past eight. Outgoing Labour MP, Lewis O'all, will give her valedictory speech in Parliament later today. She's been appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be Pacific Ambassador for Gender Equality, and Louisa Wall is with us now. Kiyoha. Kiyah, Suzy. You've got to the last day. You've got your final farewell later. What are your feelings about going into today? I'm feeling a sense of satisfaction in some ways. I've had to reflect back on the last 14 years and this afternoon I will be able to grace our House of Parliament one last time and share some of my memories. And so I'm looking forward to the next phase of my life, to be honest. Susie, I turned 50 in February and it's a bit of a tohu for me these other things to do. So I'm excited about the next stage in my life. Indeed, and I'd really like to talk about your new job in just a moment. I'm interested, though, about how you look back, as you say, you've been reflecting, and lots of people will point to things like marriage equality as amongst your greatest achievements. What do you pick out? I think at the heart of everything I've tried to do have been New Zealanders with real issues, using their voices, sometimes from vulnerable positions. And I guess being open to listening to them and then wanting to assist. Marriage equality, I think, has defined my parliamentary career. It was founded on fundamental human rights principles, addressing the inherent discrimination perpetrated by our states, obviously highlighting our colonial history. But there have been so many others. I think period poverty, FGM reform, revenge porn, there's so many. And, you know, I wouldn't, if I'd have been in a different position, probably just putting it out there, I wouldn't have been able to achieve those with the community. So I can't have, I stand in a position where I'm very satisfied about what I've been able to achieve. Now, as I understand it, you're able as an MP to choose the day that you give your valedictory. Is that the case? It is. So did you choose a Thursday and because I guess you would know the Prime Minister was unlikely to be there? No, they had nothing to do with it. I thought that at the end of a sitting lot would be appropriate. Probably not a lot of people know that as IPU chair at the end of the last session, I went to Indonesia representing our country within the context of that responsibility. And so it just seems a good time for me to have my valedictory. Then gives me time over the weekend to pack up my office and essentially to move out and to vacate for someone else to come and occupy my office. Your valedictory speech, I guess you've probably written it and rewritten it and redrafted it again. How would you characterize it and will you be firing any shots? I think I would say my life's been an open book. It's going to be transparent. It's going to be transparent. It's going to be acknowledging of all those voices. Not all of them, obviously. I'll pick certain ones that for me define the legacy that I have not only been able to leave the country, but other people. You know, I highlight abortion, law reform, and finally being really clear that women have bodily autonomy, our rights to services, and now we can access those services without being abused. I mean, that works that belongs to Dame Margaret Sittsarrow, and she's coming today, and I'm incredibly, you know, privileged that to help her legacy be fulfilled within our institution of Parliament. to help her legacy be fulfilled within our institution of parliament. Many people will have heard your comments last weekend regarding the relationship with the Labour Party with the Prime Minister. When did you decide to speak about that situation? When I was in front of the camera with Jack in my exit interview with Audrey, I felt that I was prepared to share my parliamentary story and I still am. I think that from my perspective, we want parliamentarians to be honest and transparent and democracy actually matters and at the heart of that for me is information and people making decisions and fully participating. But I am happy always to answer a question and I will do so honestly. Any regrets over speaking out and how that's played out? I don't have regrets. I think that if people who have regrets end up dwelling on those and they become little pebbles that bite into you over the summer, we used to have that saying when I played rugby, and that's why I always prepared to the best of my ability, went out on the field, and hopefully we would prevail, but at minimum I'd know that I'd given my all, and I'd left it all on the field, and there was nothing more I could have done in terms of the outcome. How do you think it's changed your legacy? Has it tarnished it? Being honest and transparent, I hope not. So you're quite comfortable, you're quite happy, you feel that it is as much part of you as so many of the other things you'll be remembered for? Well, I mean, I think all I've said is that the coach didn't pick me for a particular role and I was prepared to get on with the job. I mean, if people find that offensive, it kind of perplexes me. It was a reality. I've chosen to share it. I was asked. But I've also been really clear that the privilege of being a member of parliament enables you to contribute in so many other ways. And being an MP for me, sorry, a cabinet minister wasn't being all an end all and certainly isn't the limit of what parliamentarians can achieve and champion here in Parliament. Just a quick word, unfortunately, we are squeezed for time on your new role, the equality, the Pacific Ambassador for Gender Equality. What do you want to achieve first? Oh, look, I'm going to have to work with the women and with the LGBT community in the Pacific. My job is to amplify their voices and to support, I guess, greater recognition of them within their political systems. I'm going to have to have a different role, Susie. I'm used to using my own, but my job will be to help find others who share the same co-papa. That is, we want to address the empowerment of women and girls. We will use sports as a context for development. The LGBT community in some countries is hidden. We must find those people, support them, enable them to live good, you know, dignified lives. And within a context for some of them are seven countries actually, where they're still criminal. So we did that in 1986. My job is to help mobilize and support not only the community, but the politicians, so that we can address these apparelant archaic pieces of legislation that are very much about our colonial history. So we are still going through the decolonisation process. Lewis O'all, outgoing Labour MP, NAMIHI, Goal. Thank you for joining us on Morning Reports. It is now 28 minutes to nine. That's time to catch up with the business world now. Nicholas Pointin. Nicholas, how are we looking on those markets? Well, Wall Street finished this morning session very strongly, following profit forecast from some of the airlines, and a growing feeling that inflation in the US has peaked at 8.5%. So the Dow Jones closed up 1%. The SMP 500 finished 1.1% higher and the NASDAQ was up 2%. Our local top 50 index starts the day on 11,875. That's after closing down 14 points yesterday. On the currency front, the Kiwi rose then dipped yesterday following the RBN's interest rate decision. That's as investors focused on comments from the bank in which it said it would stick to its previously published rate path. So the New Zealand dollar got as high as 69 US since yesterday but has now fallen to 67.9. It's trading at 91.2 Australian, 51.8 pence, 0.624 euro, 85.4 Japanese yen, and 4.33 Chinese yuan. Brent crude oil is up $4 to 108 US.79 a barrel, and gold is up $10 to 1,97 US dollars an ounce. And that's it from me wishing everyone a safe and bliss-filled Easter. The business team will be back with an update on the latest news and numbers at 20 past 12 in Midday Report. Kiola, thank you very much, Nicholas. Yes, you have a good Easter as well. Now, still to come before 9 here on Morning Report, South Taranaki is hoping for a quick bounce back from COVID. Australia has sent its Pacific Minister to Solomon Islands to urge the Prime Minister not to sign a security pact with China. And with Easter weekend coming up, we're joined a day early by our Australia correspondent Kerry Ann Walsh. Now the headlines with Nicola Wright. A COVID modler is worried about the rising rate of infections among elderly in the southern region, which seems to be an outlier compared to other DHBs. Matthew Perry of Otago University told Morning Report the region is experiencing a long tail from its Omicron peak, particularly among those over 60. He says it seems that will persist for a while and there'll be increased risks going into winter. Mr. Perry says hospitalisation rates have been manageable but any further increases could put serious pressure on the health system. More people are asking about loans as their living costs rise. Non-profit lending organisation, Ngathanga Microfinance, got 30 inquiries a month before the pandemic. It's 500 a month now. The chief executive Natalie Vincent told Morning Report, the rising cost of living has become a survival issue rather than a cause for lifestyle change. The extent of the damage from the latest storm to hit Taira, Fiti and the Wairoa district is expected to become clear over the course of the morning. High country areas and towns north of Gisbon appear to have borne the brunt of the rain. Hundreds were without power last night and roads including State Highway 35 north of Gis to Portaka, and State Highway 38 at Fraser Town, inland from Wairoa, remain closed. An overseas recruitment campaign targeting intensive care nurses has employed just three people since it launched two months ago. The program was set up to entice New Zealand qualified critical care nurses back from overseas to ease acute workforce shortages. The health minister Andrew Little says filling three jobs is a good result and another 22 nurses have been referred to DHBs for possible employment. A further 28 applicants are still being assessed. A major European security organisation says there are clear patterns of Russian troops in Ukraine violating international humanitarian law. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe says it's found credible evidence of killings, torture and other inhuman punishment. The report says Ukraine also appears to have committed violations, but Russia's transgressions are far greater. That's the news. Kiyoda, I'm Emil Donovan, and today on the detail, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused some countries to dramatically increase their defense spending. Is there a case for New Zealand to follow suit? Even if you've got modern platforms, if you've only got so many, there's only so many places they can be at once. If you're going to ask your defence force to do more, I think you either have to give them more resources or the inevitable result is they're going to have to do less of some things. The detail. On Apple, Spotify, RNZ, or wherever you get your podcasts. The weather in the towns and cities with Met Service, Kaitaya and Fangare have a sunny day in a high of 21. Auckland and Hamilton fine in 20. Tauraya and Fangare have a sunny day in a high of 21. Auckland and Hamilton fine in 20. Tauranga and Fakataane, fine, 21. Rotterua, blue skies in 19. Gisbon cloud clears to fine this afternoon, 17. Napier and Hastings, morning cloud clears. 19, the high for Napier, Hastings 18. Taupour, sunshine in 17. Taumarui and New Plymouth, fine and 20. Fanganiui, just some morning cloud, 18. Palmer's to North and live in, blue sunshine and 17. Taumarunui and New Plymouth, Fine and 20. Fanganoi, just some morning cloud, 18. Palmerston, North and live in, blue skies and 18. Karpit Sunny, 17. Masterton morning cloud clearing and then fine, 16 degrees. Wellington fine, but with the chance of a shower this morning, 15.

Dunedin, fine, 19, and Inveragil, partly cloudy. And there may be a shower or two, 17 degrees. It's 22 minutes to nine. And you're listening to Morning Report with Corindan and Susie Ferguson. Well, South Taranaki appears well placed to bounce back from COVID after dodging the worst of the disruption caused by the virus. Some coastal businesses are enjoying record sales, well, at least one contractor says the virus motivated him to take the plunge on a $30 million development. Our Tanaki Fanganui reporter Robin Martin took a spin down surf highway. A steady stream of customers is making their way into Ardi Tarts Cafe in Opanaki where homemade pies and coffee are the order of the day. Co-owner Richard Payton says business is humming. We've been busy as ever. It just hasn't really slowed down for us. It's just been ticking along nicely. What do you think explains that? I don't know. It's just really crazy. It's just weird. We still see heaps of people locals are all out supporting us too so it's amazing how many people still keep coming down at the dreamtime surf shop the coffee machine is also working overtime and it's not only caffeine that's in demand co-owner Craig Dingell says board shorts and t-shirts are moving too first lockdown was a good holiday because we'd been working really hard all summer. This summer just gone has been a record summer for us, retail-wise. Kiwi's not leaving New Zealand, just travelling New Zealand and spending money. Mr Dingell says overseas tourists accounted for 10% of business pre-pandemic, which has been eclipsed by a 30% rise in domestic visitors. Manager of the Orpanaki Beach Holiday Camp Julian Harkness says it's benefited from being in a pandemic sweet spot. Those that have had a lot of international have found it harder and those probably are a relatively long way away from large populations but Openaki has appealed to all those people that are close from the farming communities and out of New Plymouth and out of Wanganui etc and has stayed solid. Across at Hawera developer C.J. Marni says COVID motivated him to take the plunge on the $30 million South Taranaki Business Park. I probably started this with the idea that we had inflation coming. Being told a lot in life about, you know, in the 70s and the 80s with lots of inflation. I wasn't around at that stage, but certainly know a lot of people who were. This was one way I sort of saw of trying to stay ahead of that, I guess, going over the bank a lot of money, and hopefully it's worth less at the end, and what I own is worth more. Not everyone's had an easy ride, however. Owner of the lunch shack on High Street, Theo Horton, tells a story familiar to food retailers in the main centres. See, we've been in it so long now. It is hard to sort of, I think definitely from when we first opened, it's definitely between that 30-40% sort of thing. It's, yeah, come down, so. Have you called on the government assistance? Have you done that's usually the measures? Yeah, yeah, we have called on the government assistance. Haura locals had mixed views on the handling of the pandemic. You know, we're over sort of red and I think it sort of slipped into like a little orange anyway. I just think the government's damned if they do and they're damned if they don't, actually. Since I've been back, it's been pretty good and I've got for the right. Probably like fund more teachers because it's really annoying as a student. When you like rock up to class and there's like no teacher or there's a reliever. It's definitely getting a lot closer to home but I don't think it's really changed much of an attitude of going out. I think we're doing okay. Yeah, I think we're doing okay. And Taranaki reported 288 new COVID cases yesterday. 76 of those in South Taranaki. There were 2,128 active cases in the community, 18 to 9. Overseas now, in a known goal for Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Sweden and Finland are on the brink of joining NATO. Mr Putin had warned the countries not to join the alliance, but in a news conference overnight, the Prime Minister of Finland and Sweden said Russia's assault on Ukraine had encouraged them to pursue membership more rigorously. Here's Finland's leader, Sanamarin. The European security architecture have changed fundamentally after Russian's invasion of Ukraine. To change in the security landscape make it necessary to analyze how we best secure peace for Finland and in our region in the future. And here's Sweden's Prime Minister, Magdalena Andersen. After 24th of February, the security landscape has completely changed, both with the demands from Russia in December and then the invasion of Ukraine. And given that situation, we have to really think through what is best for Sweden and our security and our peace in this new situation. CNN's Nick Robertson says Russia's neighbours are worried they could be targeted next. The consensus is dealing with Putin at the moment. You cannot know what is thinking. You cannot know what his next moves are going to be. And therefore all bets are off the table. Therefore, you have to double down on your own security. And that is what's happening here. That's the impact. Does it make the world safer? Probably not. But it's a reaction to the ground realities that were ground realities since World War II that President Putin has shaken. Again, we cannot understate how big the changes are that are happening. We talk about the war in Ukraine, but big, significant geopolitical changes are happening because of it, and today's witnessed some of that. Now, the Economist magazine's defense editor Shars Shank Joshi explained its significance to the BBC's Even Davis. The Finnish Russia border, as anyone who looks at a map will know, is very substantial. And of course, it is historically very resonant. Russia or rather the Soviet Union and Finland fought very bitter wars, including the Winter War, which was incredibly costly to Russia and Soviet troops and led to the effective neutrality of Finland. And Sweden has practiced neutrality in later non-alignment for over 200 years. So for these countries to join NATO is profoundly important. It does create challenges for NATO defending those countries, but by and large, you're bringing in two incredibly capable militaries, and it makes it easier to defend the Baltics. Okay. And there's that what's in it then for NATO, because no one seems to be in much doubt that NATO will, if they apply, NATO is going to say yes, they're not going to be told no. There's a sense in which Finland, particularly, but also Sweden, are more interoperable with NATO, in other words, capable of fighting alongside it than some NATO countries are themselves. They've been moving closer to NATO for years, particularly since Russia's seizure of Crimea. They have participated in NATO operations. They're geographically fundamental to protecting the Baltic Sea, to protecting Estonia, you know, putting Kaliningrad at risk, the Russian exclave in Europe. So they're effectively part of those calculations anyway. And there's a sense that why would you want these two pro-European members of the EU, flourishing democracy, strong armies outside of NATO if you can have them in? I think there's no real dispute even in potential pro-Puton countries like Hungary. That's the economist Defence Editor Shashank Joshi speaking to the BBC's Ivan Davis. Quarter to nine. Australia's Pacific Minister has told Solomon Islands Prime Minister Monace Suggavare that he should not sign a security pact with China. However, this is Australia's Pacific Minister, Zed Salceda, made this desperate dash to Honiara to express Australia's concerns. Research Fellow at the Lowy Institute, Mihay Soura, says Australia's last-minute efforts to appease the Pacific nation are too late. He spoke to the ABC's Beverly O'Connor. Prime Minister Sogavaria has made it very clear that he intends to broaden Solomon Island's security partnerships beyond Australia and beyond the region. And we do have to take that at face value. So certainly it's useful to express our concerns in a respectful way, but it might be a bit too much to expect that changes the immediate course of events. Do you think there was a lapse in Australian diplomacy that allowed this pact to progress to this point seemingly without our knowledge? I think this is a real test for Australian diplomacy in the Pacific. The factors that we see threatening security in the region, a lot of them are external, and what's very clear from this draft agreement that's been leaked in the last few weeks is China's strategic intent for the Pacific. So over the past few years, China's made a push into the region, backing up economic relationships with political relationships, and now introducing the element of military statecraft into its toolkit. So really, this is a moment where Australia can re-evaluate how it partners with the Pacific and think about how we can, together, in consultation with the region, build a more secure Pacific. I want to talk about that in a moment, but do you feel in a way many of these nations have become so entangled with China that it's very hard for the existing relationship with Australia to stay the same? I think the aspects of how Australia engages with the Pacific, there is some overlap with what China's been doing in the region, but we have been approaching it in a different way. Pacific countries' economic relationships with China tend to be more significant than Australia's. So it's not so much a question of our political engagement and diplomatic engagement as it is, how can we broaden Australia's relationships with the Pacific? How can we incorporate more economic prosperity and economic development into those relationships? The security issue, it really is a distraction from the genuine needs that the Pacific has expressed in terms of its human security. So looking there at climate change, economic development and health and education needs. And there's a lot that Australia has done in these spaces and certainly a lot more that we can do, which is very much outside of what China's been able to offer the Pacific. 11 minutes to 9, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Some traffic news. Auckland, Henderson Valley Road, is closed between Great North Road and Smyth Road due to a police issue. The 141-142 bus routes are being detoured and motorists should allow extra time for delays in that area. Central North Island, the Desert Road is closed. This is between the Rangipo and Waiuru after a truck rolled around midnight. So do take care. The driver was critically injured and the road is going to take a wee while to clear. So be warned if you're heading through that part of the Desert Road. East Coast State Highway 35 is closed all away from Oquitoo north of Gisbon through to Portaka due to fallen trees between Gisbon and Tolaga Bay. And State Highway 38 is also closed in Fraser Town at the intersection with Pakalwai Road due to flooding. The State Highway 2 is down to one lane from south from Gisbon to Wairoa. 11 minutes to 9. Catherine Ryan, I think is with us to update us on what's coming up on 9 to noon. Hiro, good morning. Atamarii, Susie. Good morning, everyone. What is driving these high food prices? Inflation running hot, we know. We're looking particularly at food prices this morning with Stats, New Zealand. They'll work through exactly how much things have increased, even month on month. We'll speak to the principal of a King Country school that scrap traditional class schedules and seen benefits Taunanui High School adopted the big picture learning model five years ago. We'll hear all about it. And you think you need a break over Easter. We'll catch up with Victoria Bruce and his seven-year-old daughter, Emily. We last talked to them on Christmas Eve as they were doing the Te Araroa Trail. Today they're on the last day of their 2,100 kilometerre, 138 day adventure. And speaking of adventure, Chris Long, we spoke into his father, Robert Long, best known as Bean Sprout down on the West Coast, lived an isolated life for so many years, then married and raised two kids down there. Well, one of those kids has all grown up and now travelling the world, Robert Long on his life at Gorge River. Yamaha, that is Catherine Ryan. Of course, coming up with 9 to noon shortly because it's 9 minutes to 9 and to Australia now. And minor parties are vying for the balance of power in what is expected to be a gripping election. Pauline Hanson's One Nation and Clive Palmer's United Australia Party are attempting to harness voters against COVID-19 health rules. At the other end of the spectrum, the Greens have made a pitch to get the biggest issue the world faces climate change onto the campaign agenda. The ABC's John Daily reports. Ryan Otto doesn't usually align himself with any side of politics, but this election is different. He lives in the southern Queensland town of Toowoomba in the electorate of Groom. And after losing his job as a teacher because of vaccine mandates, Ryan Otto says his political views have drastically changed. I would say normally in an election, I would never vote. I would always donkey vote personally. But the parties that are actually getting involved and are in touch in the fight against medical discrimination and against these mandates, they've won me over in a sense. Despite the mandates helping to push very high uptake of two doses of vaccines, Pauline Hanson's One Nation and Clive Palmer's United Australia parties are appealing to voters disillusioned by health rules and lockdowns. Pauline Hansen says she'll have candidates in all 151 lower house seats up for grabs. People have lost their jobs. We have seen teachers, nurses, doctors, professionals have lost their jobs due to this COVID mandate that's been imposed on people through not only the state governments but also the federal government. People will not forget that. Pauline Hansen also announced the former Firebrand Coalition, imposed on people through not only the state governments but also the federal government. People will not forget that. Pauline Hansen also announced the former Firebrand Coalition MP George Christensen is also joining her ranks after defecting from the coalition last week. He'll now run as One Nation's third Senate candidate. For a long while I've diverged with the views of the government, most notably around the issue of vaccine mandates. Analysts have called the seat unwinnable, so the move seems strange, considering George Christensen's strong position in the lower house seat of Dawson, which covers Queensland's Wits Sundays. He's been accused of pursuing a golden handshake in the form of a $105,000 resettlement payment given to politicians who leave the job involuntarily, like getting beaten at an election. George Christensen denies that's the case. On the other side of politics, the Greens leader Adam Bant told the National Press Club his party is set to become a key power broker in the Senate. The Greens are now poised to be the most powerful third party in the Parliament after the election. We are fighting, we are growing and we are winning. The Greens are hoping to pick up another three seats in the upper house and as many as they can in the lower. Adam Bant is promising to stop new coal and gas projects and pushing a $7.5 billion plan to get mental health and visits to the dentist covered by Medicare. The Greens leader also took a different approach to a gotcha question on wage growth from a journalist. You said in the speech that wages growth wasn't going particularly well. What's the current WPI? Well, Google it, mate. I mean, like... So how influential will parties like Greens and Pauline Hanson's One Nation be in the next Parliament? Australia Institute Executive Director Ben Oquist says there's a good chance of a balance of power Parliament. Well, I think there's a big chance of a bigger crossbench in both the House and the Senate following this election. And at a time when there's disillusionment from voters, more choices and more options can be a good thing. That is Australia Institute Executive Director Ben O'Quist. Ending that report by the ABC's John Daly at six minutes to nine. Right, well, let's cross the Tasman now and talk to Canberra correspondent Kerry in Welsh. Good morning. Good morning, Colin. Let's talk about gotcha questions and journalism because it's been fascinating to watch what's happened in Australia and it's drifted over here a little bit too in the last few days. But let's start with Anthony Albanese who was actually caught out very badly on something he should have known, right? Look, if your head's in another space which is what he said, I mean look, okay, first up, yes. He should have known that the official cash rate is 0.1. It hasn't changed for 18 months, and it's what's led to record low interest rates for mortgage holders and others in Australia. It's a fairly elementary figure, and he should have known it. You can understand when a leader's mind is on a whole lot of different things, trying to second guess where the next question is coming, but it should have been a figure that was forefront of mind. Yeah, no, I get that. I mean, people who understand mistakes. We had minister here who couldn't remember his own policy announcement yesterday. People get it. They know people are tired and stressed. But the thing is, right, I mean, Morrison, under pressure, looked to attack Labor on economic credibility. Surely everything Labor would have been planning was to mute that. Couldn't afford a mistake like this, could they? Well, look, it's been a terrible first week. There's no doubt about that, because he couldn't name the unemployment rate either. And all his economic policies are couched around increasing jobs within Australia. And so as is the Prime Minister, note, he's fanciful, unverifiable claim that he would create 1.3 million jobs in the next couple of years. I mean, that sort of stuff is fairy tale, and nobody is really taking him up on that. I mean, I'd love to see a dissertation on that in the weekend papers, but let's just hold... We won't be holding our breath on that. Look, I think election campaigns are brutal, particularly six weeks of them. The Prime Minister is an expert, some say gifted campaigner. Not a particularly good Prime Minister, but a fantastic politician. He sails through, he's got the gift of being able to spurt out numbers, whether they be correct or not. Anthony Albanyi does not have that, and he's a waffler, and he's a pretty congenial sort of bloke, like he'll hang around until the last question is after press conferences. The Prime Minister cuts and runs at 12, if reporters are lucky. So you've got two leaders with very different styles. And, you know, six weeks is not going to be good for Anthony Albanese, but it will be good for the Prime Minister. I mean, don't consider this as a contest of ideas. I mean, as Adam Bant, the Greenslead said at the press club yesterday, where is the contest of ideas? Why are we having got your question? Why aren't we talking about Australia's future? And it's true. Why aren't we? And why is the media insisting on doing the media, you know, big amorphous blob, doing this sort of thing to get the headlines. Why aren't we talking about the really important? Well, I think they'll be, it's a law of diminishing returns, isn't it? I mean the gotcha questions, people will be sick of it, won't they? And I see that Green Leader was saying, what, Google it, mate. It was not a bad response, was it? What a response. As one of the columnists wrote in this morning, you know, it would have been a head-slapping moment for Anthony Albanese thinking, why didn't I think of that? What a perfect response. Because they do have to be treated with a certain degree of derision, these sorts of questions, because you know, it isn't about trying to probe the depths of, you know, the economic veracity of certain policies that are put out by either side. It's all about getting a cheap headline. And so, you know, these huge travelling media are always competing against each other for the headline. So, you know, it's all, I think after six weeks of this, we're going to be very sick of it, Colin. Yeah, well, it can always come over here. I mean, you know, we don't have to isolate it anymore. Well, exactly. I mean, how fantastic is that? I will be coming over within the next couple of months. But over here, I mean, if the airport chaos, getting to New Zealand is anything like it was for me yesterday trying to get to Queensland, which I could have flown to Wellington and back twice in the time it took me to get to Queensland, which I could have flown to Wellington and back twice in the time it took me to get to Queensland. It is nutso out there. It is crazy because people are trying to get away for Easter. Yes. You know, there's 100% of travellers and 60% of staff. Kerry Ann Walsh, have a great Easter. Thank you very much for talking to us. That's us for today. Have a good weekend, everybody."}
