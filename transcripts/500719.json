That means no limits on indoor gatherings and kids are only encouraged to wear masks to school. The biggest rise in food prices in a decade. On the same day, the Reserve Bank signals a rise in interest rates. High emotion as our first plane loads of travellers from Aussie are allowed in without any isolation. And Warrior's winger Marcello Montoya gets a hefty ban for a homophobic slur on the fields. Good evening. It's Orange for Easter. From 1159 tonight, the whole country will move to the orange traffic light setting. There were just under 9,500 cases of COVID today. 551 people are in hospital and sadly 15 deaths were reported. But the government says the evidence is clear that we are over the peak of the Omicron wave. So it's safe to move. Orange means no gathering limits or restrictions at all in bars and restaurants, not even masks. School kids are only encouraged to wear them too, and yet they are still compulsory in retail and on public transport. Here's political editor, General Lynch. A toast to Orange. Wellington's Dakota Bar celebrating the return of proper hospitality. I'm relieved that we are going to orange. Orange. Wellington's Dakota Bar celebrating the return of proper hospitality. I'm relieved that we are going to orange at midnight tonight. Auckland's St Alice buzzed too. Fantastic. We're stoked. Do a little dance, New Zealand. The government has given the nightlife the orange light, the dance floor back from midnight tonight. Tonight, tonight. You're going hard on clubbing here. I would love a nice little boogie. Might not go into town tonight, but this this weekend. It's actually going to make the staff morale improve as well because they're not going to have to be the police officers in the bar or the fun police. The orange light is basically back to normal, but with masks, though not for school children anymore. It won't be justified in all cases any longer. In some cases, schools will have had a COVID-19 outbreak that will have passed. The government's left that decision up to individual schools. Pediatrician, Dr. Jen Russell, thinks that's a mistake. It might see a resurgence of COVID-19, but also influenza, because viruses too tend to thrive in winter when people mix more indoors. And for those reasons, I think it's really important to keep wearing masks in schools. There are other places you don't need to mask up anymore, too. Though the COVID minister got himself in a heck of a muddle trying to explain where. The rules have changed, so we're still encouraging them on flights and public transport. Oops, actually, let's find a friend on that. Give me one minute. I've just got masks are still a requirement on public transport, so including flights. Oh, he fumbled retail too. For some reason, I didn't bring the exact list. Saying masks were out for shoppers. So you don't have to wear a face mask to the supermarket anymore? No. Wrong, you do. I do have the updated list now and I refreshed my memory of them and I was incorrect on retail. Chris Hipkin's so confused, he shut down questions on masks while he awaited some clarity. So if you just give me a few minutes, the advice will come through. I'll be clear on that. Just triple check that I'm correct and I'll come back to you on that. Should you be across that detail? Look, I just had a bit of a mind blank there. So to be clear? So you can have people passing on a dance floor but I have to wear a bit of a mind blank there. So to be clear? So you can have people pashing on a dance floor, but I have to wear a mask to go to the supermarket. At the moment, you still have to wear a mask in a retail environment, that is correct. Where is your logic on that? Ultimately, there's a question of volume. There are going to be a lot more people in the supermarket on a weekly basis than there will be out and about patching on a dance floor. It does seem strange that there is that inconsistency. Well this I think is the unfortunate reality of the confusion around the traffic light rules. Perhaps why the minister got himself in a big old mask mess. Yes, well, OK, Jenna, that wasn't the COVID minister's finest performance, was it? Perhaps a little bit of COVID-19 fatigue sitting in there. Aside from this being a very sloppy performance from one of Jacinda Arduin's top ranking and top performing ministers, it does highlight some of the absurdities now built into the system by exempting hospitality, what was a high-risk venue before. The government has effectively deemed it safer to be breathing all over each other in bars than to cozy up with a book in the corner of a public library or to hit the mall to select a new pair of sneakers. The government rightly argues that compliance would be an issue in bars, but it may find that non-compliance may become more widespread if the rules are inexplicable and confusing, even to those who wrote them. Political editor, General Lynch, thank you. It is getting more and more expensive to live. Food prices have soared almost 8% in the past year, the biggest annual rise in a decade. Fruit and vegetables increased by a whopping 18%. And with inflation running rampant, the Reserve Bank has lifted the official cash rate 50 basis points in an attempt to curb spending. But as Mitchell Alexander reports, rising mortgage rates will hit homeowners in the pocket too. The weekly supermarket shop now bringing record-breaking pain to your wallet. We're basically pricing people out of being able to live healthy, sustainable lives. It means that I don't eat out. Here's why. Annual food prices jumped 7.6% last month compared with March 2021, the highest annual increase in more than 10 years. Fruit and vegetable prices increased a whopping 18% while groceries were up 6.7%. If it was marginal last year, then it's not affordable this year. This is what inflation looks like, but the government says these prices go beyond that. Instead, blaming a lack of competition between supermarkets, something the Commerce Commission's been looking into. We have to move in the area of competition for New Zealanders so that they have fairer food prices. In a statement, food staffs which owns Pack and Save and New World says food prices have increased faster than inflation because of unprecedented cost pressures in its supply chain. Countdown didn't respond to our request for comment. As food prices help drive inflation to a 30-year high, the Reserve Bank today responding by hiking the official cash rate to 1.5% hitting homeowners with higher mortgage bills. A&Z has already increased its floating rate 0.5%. 50 basis point increase is going to equal about $200 per month for a first home buyer. For people who have been borrowing in the past, they're likely to face a higher interest rate down the track. And people who are contemplating borrowing now are obviously facing higher interest rates. And that's for those already on the property ladder. Wellingtonian Michael Lay is still trying and says rising mortgage rates won't help. The chances of actually owning a house is kind of eroding and it's not a good outlook. Even though the housing market is cooling, it's still out of reach for many. It's going to make it even harder for us to get in the market as first home buyers and you could have done everything right and you just kind of get left behind it. A lot of New Zealanders getting left behind as life gets more and more expensive. Mitchell Alexander News Hub. Kiota to our Aussie cousins who are now allowed into New Zealand without any isolation or quarantine requirements. The first flights of freedom from across the ditch have arrived and tourism operators are ready to cash in. Kelly Callaghan reports. The spirit of Australia touching down in Christchurch. Hi. Bringing plane loads across the ditch and raising the spirits of those here. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year. It's lovely. I saw him out cooking the distance on the plane and I actually started crying. Get a squishy hug from the grandchildren. Hey, day. Whatever the reason, their arrival means cash for the crippled tourism sector is coming. Pre-COVID, the Australian market was our biggest international market and we're delighted to have them back because it's been a real shot in the arm. A shot of adrenaline is exactly what's on offer for thrill seekers. We've got special deals here and at Topol in Auckland and our other sites so people can go sky jump, skywalk, do a jump over the river in Topol or come here. So with Aussies now allowed in and other international visitors not too far away, tourism operators are hoping those who come to New Zealand dive head first back into the market. Holy shit. operators are hoping those who come to New Zealand dive head first back into the market. Holy s'm... There won't be the influx of visitors flying directly into the south just yet. The first international flight from Qantas into Queenstown is still over a month away. On the 23rd of May, Jet Star will be soon after that on around the 3rd of June and in New Zealand 23rd of June. Those dates land just as the ski season kicks off, with Australians making up half of the ski market. It's about half of our revenue. They book solidly in advance. They spend a lot of money in the hotels and the restaurants and the bars downtown. Many restaurants and bars have had to close during the week and are in desperate need of our cashed-up cousins. We rely heavily on international tourism. Predominantly the Australians, they count for 60% of the Aerotown business. So the sooner they come back, the better. The return of the tourist has begun with more Australian gold on the horizon. Kaylee Callahan NewsHub. And the Prime Minister is at Wellington Airport. We're another two loads of travellers from Australia were due this evening. She joins us now. Kilda Prime Minister, we had a false start with the trans-tasman bubble, so can you guarantee that the borders are open for good now? Yeah, absolutely. Things have fundamentally changed, Mike. We've come from previously a position where it was about trying to maintain a COVID-free environment. Obviously, the world has changed. New Zealand's shifted its strategy and now we're open and welcoming those tourists back. And did you have to move to the orange light setting tonight so that the tourists could have a good time? Look, we made that decision based on the impact on our health system. We weren't ready to move, though. So it is an added benefit for our hospitality operators, our tourism operators, but I know that they're overall just looking forward to seeing tourists back. Prime Minister, as we saw in Jenna's story earlier, masks in shoe shops, but not in nightclubs. Even the COVID minister getting a bit confused about things there. Is that logical? Yeah, it's about being completely pragmatic. Look, as we already know, in hospitality settings, we haven't had mask use because the simple reason you're eating and drinking, so we continue to carry that over now that clubs are opening, It would be impractical to have a situation where you're donning them, taking them on and off from in between drinks. We've got to be pragmatic. We know masks make a difference, but we also have to take into account where they are being used. And just finally on inflation, we saw an 8% rise in food prices today, 18% for fruit and vegetables. These are essentials. How much responsibility does your government take for that? Look, we know that there are extraordinary pressures in the international environment right now. COVID recovery is putting pressure on supply chains. The war in Ukraine putting pressure on fuel prices, which is impacting on the movement of goods and services. We have no doubt that there is pressure on Kiwi households at the moment. We're doing our bit trying to reduce fuel prices as an example. But one of the other things we have to do that is unique to New Zealand, we do not have fair competition in our supermarket network in New Zealand, and we are working hard to address that. That has to change. Prime Minister Jacinda are doing their life for us from Wellington Airport. Thank you for joining us this evening. Well, Cyclone Feely has attacked Teirafatee with ferocity with ferocity today and isn't letting up just yet. The rare red-level warning remains in place until midnight tonight with river levels on the rise. Shannon Redstall is there. Shannon, how's the region fairing tonight? Well, it is on the rise. Shannon Redstall is there. Shannon, how's the region faring tonight? Well, it is battling the elements, Sam. There are roads closed power outages and significant surface flooding, but the worst may still be yet to come. It has been raining relentlessly here since this morning, but we are still expecting another five to six hours of heavy rain. Up the coast in Tokomaru Bay, they were hit particularly hard three weeks ago in the last storm. They are once again expecting to be without power and potentially cut off tonight. I spoke to volunteer there, Lillian Teho Ward, who says it's been a really challenging time for her community. This is the third time I've led a response every time it's heartbreaking. But I'm grateful that this time we probably have a 32-hour lead-in to ask Farno to start preparing. So I'm grateful for that. And I'm grateful that we haven't lost any life. This southerly wind, it is really starting to bite and may get up to 130 kilometres an hour in exposed places. And it is this wind, along with rising river to bite and may get up to 130 kilometres an hour in exposed places. And it is this wind, along with rising river levels right across the region, that are causing concern for authorities tonight. Civil defense says they are expecting more damage into the evening, particularly power outages and trees down. So they're really encouraging people to stay home and stay safe tonight. Shannon, thanks for that update. Go away. Get dry. Get warm. Thank you. New Zealand has 9,000 kilometres of water piping that needs to be replaced at an estimated cost of more than $2 billion. That's because the pipes are made from asbestos cement, and a new study has revealed asbestos fibers are leaching into our drinking water. Kasha Brownlee reports. Replacing decades-old piping. It's urgent. I think we just get them out as soon as we can. That's because these cement pipes contain asbestos and a new study has found its leaching into Christchurch's drinking water. We're throwing this water into a pipe network infrastructure which is past its lifetime expectancy. Samples were taken from 35 locations across Christchurch, targeting asbestos cement pipes that were laid between the 1930s and 60s. Asbestos fibres were found in over half the samples. It's a little bit out of sight out of mind. So long as it's still working and there's not drinking water coming to the surface, other things take priority. The Garden City is renowned for its pristine drinking water, but that could also be part of the problem. The water has relatively low dissolved ions in it, which means it's quite aggressive to cement. They turn into the consistency of wet cardboard. Researchers say although there is no immediate concern for public health, many pipes are up to 30 years past the use-by date. New Zealand has 9,000 kilometres of asbestos piping that needs replacing. That's equivalent to five and a half times the length of New Zealand. It's estimated to cost over $2 billion, an expense that will come back to ratepayers. It illustrates how far behind we are on our replacement strategy for our networks of pipes. It could take as long as two decades to catch up. Kasha Brownlee, News Hub. Last night we brought you the story of a father's two-year struggle to get safety glass installed at his home to protect his disabled son. Within 24 hours, an Auckland Community Group and a Taranaki Glass Company have linked up two-year struggle to get safety glass installed at his home to protect his disabled son. Within 24 hours, an Auckland Community Group and a Taranaki Glass Company have linked up to provide a solution. Here's Michael Mora. Zafar Gondal met dead ends with health authorities. Today, a meeting with meaning. So we've raised the money, and we'll just get it sorted. So you don't have to stress about it. He's been negotiating with health authorities for two years, trying to get safety glass installed to prevent his disabled son, Dime, from injuring himself and others. More than I expect, actually, for the last two years and now from not even 24 hours yet, so we're almost there. Yeah, I don't know know it's just so wonderful. Dave Litele, former professional boxer turned community leader, saw News Hub's story, posted about it. And bang, it's happening. Within hours, donations. And some of his own money meant he had the 11,000 needed for the job. He's scathing of the health system's convoluted approach. They keep doing the same things, they keep funding the same organisation, that are filled with bureaucrats, nothing's going to change. So I'm hoping out of this, you know, some pressures put on them, you know, to change. As we chatted, a text arrived from a Taranaki-based glass company. We had one of the team wanting to measure tomorrow. We spoke to the glass company. This is something that we do, and we're good at it. So if we can help someone out while we do it then all to it. And with the help of supplier FMI Home Innovation, they say the job will get done for free. Once we've got the measurements for the glass, they'll put it into production and have it made by next week. So that's pretty cool. No, mucking around, no excuse us. Get the work done. It's wonderful. If money's not required for the glasswork, Letellis says what he's raised will be donated to the family. It was good. It was good to help. Michael Morrow, Newsop. Oh, how awesome is that? I love it when we get a good result. Well, here is now with a recap of today's weather, and it was pretty wet in the north. Yeah, it was. Fortunately, most of the island was spared, as fairly rolled in, but as expected, the East Cape received a lot of rain. Well over 180 millimetres since midnight. The good news is the storm is now lying offshore from the East Cape, but the next few hours will be rough. There are still warnings in place, and I'll have full details later in the hour.

He said it would keep going until he got what he wanted. The Ukrainians believe he'll do anything it takes, and in Maruipal already has. weeks on the war in Ukraine. He said it would keep going until he got what he wanted. The Ukrainians believe he'll do anything it takes and in Maruiapol already has. Europe correspondently said Rima reports. Ordinary bullets and bombs have already unleashed evil on Maripol, but these Ukrainian fighters now claim they were targets of a chemical attack. I could hardly breathe and immediately felt dizzy. My legs gave way, this man weezers. People were fainting everywhere, another soldier says. The enemy dropped the canisers with some kind of aerosol chemical. And it was like a cloud of fog or something like a cloud of smoke. The allegations are still unverified and Russia denies it, but pro-Russian separatists have been openly talking up a chemical attack on state-controlled TV. We should ask for chemical units who will find a way to smoke those mows out of their holes. President Putin described the war as unavoidable today. We are helping, he said. They were comments made during a trip to a space center to mark the anniversary of Russia sending the first man into space. He boasted of how the Soviet Union had achieved that, also despite Western sanctions, and concluded that peace talks have hit a dead end. Not everyone in Russia backs Putin and his war. I think the world should know that there are many Russians who are against this. But the country's last remaining independent polling company says the conflict has actually increased his support. The Ukrainians betrayed us, this man says. They sold out to the Americans so the Americans could put weapons near our borders. But it's the weapons Russia is using now that has the world's attention. In London, Lysit Rima, Newsub. Defense Minister, Penny Hinares, hasn't ruled out the possibility of New Zealand Defence Force entering Ukraine.

No, not going into Ukraine. But should New Zealand be called to play a more active role in the war? New Zealand Defence Force is always ready to respond. The Defence Minister not ruling out sending Kiwi troops into Ukraine if needed. Cabinet will continue to monitor the situation and will remain agile enough to make decisions as required. And the Kiwis on board can't wait to get there and play their part. Unfortunately for them, it takes five days in the aging Hercules. Ketki Maslamini News Hub.

Passengers on the New York subway fled in terror after a man on the train triggered a smoke grenade and then opened fire, shooting 10 of them with many more injured trying to escape. Police are looking for a 62-year-old man who they describe as known to them, but they're not calling it an act of terrorism. CBS's Mololengi reports. Just before 8.30, rush hour riders on a packed Manhattan-bound train were terrorized after a lone gunman first set off a smoke bomb, then started shooting at random. An individual on that train donned what appeared to be a gas mask. He then took a canister out of his bag and opened it. The train at that time began to fill with smoke. He then opened fire, tracking multiple people on the subway and in the platform. Cell phone video shows horrified riders bolting from the train after it pulled into the station. Passengers dragged some victims to safety, while others limped off on their own. Confusion reigned. First responders soon flooded the South Brooklyn neighborhood, treating victims for smoke inhalation and gunshot and shrapnel wounds. And coming up the stairs, I saw maybe a 16-year-old that was shot in the knee. You can clearly see the bullet. Those people screaming for medical assistance. It was just a scary moment. I'm looking for male black carrying a school bag. Police and FBI investigators scoured the station, looking for a suspect in a green workers' vest. They recovered a tote bag with a hatchet, two gas canisters, and a semi-automatic handgun that apparently jammed during the melee. They also found several undettonated devices and spent ammunition magazines. But they did not find the gunman, and at least one of the security cameras at the scene of the shooting was not working. The sequel to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard lawsuit has got underway in the United States, and it's shaping up as a celebrity blockbuster to top even the first court clash in London. Depp is suing his former wife is $75 million, alleging she defamed him as an abuser in an article for the Washington Post. I TV's Risha Dovda reports. By the small smile on his face, you wouldn't think that Johnny Depp was about to have the most intimate details of his marriage revealed to the world. Again, the actor's suing ex-wife Amber Hurd for libel over an article which she wrote in the Washington Post discussing her experiences of domestic abuse. Depp's lawyers say the article implies that Heard was physically and sexually abused by him, despite not explicitly using his name. They're suing each other for tens of millions of pounds. In today's opening statements, Depp's legal team said Hurd's accusations have made it difficult for him to get the sorts of roles he's used to. A false allegation can devastate a career and it can devastate a family. And the evidence will show that Ms. Hurd's false allegations had a significant impact on Mr. Depp's family and its ability to work. Depp and Hurd started dating in 2012 and married three years later. It lasted just 15 months. The pair have been in court before. Depp sued the publishers of the son over an article that referred to him as a wife-beater. During the trial in London, the former spouses divulged almost every detail of their tumultuous relationship. Depp lost the case and was denied an appeal. This trial is expected to last six weeks with up to 120 witnesses, including Elon Musk, James Franco and Paul Bettney. Fans have been out in force, but the judge said she'll punish Depp and heard if they sign autographs or pose for photos. Fans were also banned from camping outside the courthouse. The government's released a fresh set of guidelines to bring sex education into the 21st century. There'll be a greater focus around consent and porn, but as Imogen Wells reports, teaching these topics still won't be compulsory. Weird question, though. Nat Bell is used to asking the weird questions, teaching kids about healthy, positive relationships is a passion that's guided by her students. How I teach is what these people need to know. Something that sounds obvious but isn't always done. So the Ministry of Education released a refreshed set of guidelines to make it easier for teachers to tackle topics like consent and the influence of porn. I think all of us understand a refreshed set of guidelines to make it easier for teachers to tackle topics like consent and the influence of porn. I think all of us understand that relationships are incredibly important and have become more complex over time because of the different issues that young people are facing these days, including the digital environment. A 2018 study found 75% of young New Zealanders had discovered pornography by accident, with a quarter exposed to it by the age of 12, running the risk of kids thinking that what they see on their screens is a normal sexual relationship. That's not okay, and we need to do better, which is why it needs to be part of the health and the relationships in sexuality education. For us why it needs to be part of the health and the relationships and sexuality education. For us, it's just like your normal everyday content. It's almost everywhere and it's really like jarring. Talking about it is really like, help me change how I saw myself. But teaching about consent after year 10 still won't be compulsory. Ways that you interrelate with other people. I've already signalled that that's something that I want us to look into. Only 16% of Kiwi schools use the government's current consent program, a number that will hopefully skyrocket with this 2020-proofed education refresh. Imogen Wells NewsHub.

There are calls tonight for the Warriors to do more to educate their players about the effects of using homophobic language. It comes after the NRL judiciary issued a four-week ban for Warriors' wing, Marcello Montoya, after on-field mics caught him using a homophobic slur in last week's win over the Cowboys. But while the NRLs drawn their line in the sand, advocacy groups say more needs to be done. Alex Chapman reports. It's the word that will see Marcelo Montoya spend the next month on the sidelines. Yep. But despite now being down a man, today Warriors coach Nathan Brown wasn't so keen to talk about the suspension. My only comment on this is that it's important that everyone understands is what a terrific fellow, Ma says. He's a great bloke. And something got said in the heat of the battle and we'll just move on from it. But that's the main thing that people don't judge masks for it. That was all Brown wanted to discuss. In terms of the length of the ban, what would you have liked? I just answered the question. I'm done now. We've moved on. We've got a game to worry about this week. He later added Montoya has plenty of support around him. The NRL was more forthcoming in their reaction, though, with CEO Andrew Abdo saying in a statement that rugby league is a game for everyone, that the language won't be tolerated, and that the league support the suspension. Organisation Inside Out would like to see there be greater education. Using kind of any homophobic or transphobic language can be so damaging for rainbow communities or particularly, I think, for our young people. And they believe there's a solution. Really important for the warriors to engage with some kind of rainbow competency training, to kind of look at how they can create a more inclusive environment and I think just to be really mindful of that language and that it does have an impact and there's so many alternatives that you can say. But that'll be too late for Marcelo Montoya. Alex Chapman, Newsom. The move to Orange under the COVID protection framework has come as a relief for the country's indoor sporting codes. Top of the list, Netball's A&Z Premiership, which up until now has been played behind closed doors. Lucy Thompson joins us from Trust Arena. Lucy, you've got a game there tonight. When are we going to see the fans back? Well, Andrew, it's been a long time coming, but crowds will be back from this weekend. Netball New Zealand telling me today that crowds will be back from this weekend. Netball New Zealand telling me today that tickets will be on sale from tonight, and organisers are hopeful that crowds will turn out to not only support their teams on the court, but to support them financially off it as well. But, Andrew, it hasn't been crowds which have been the problem so far this season. It's been teams contracting COVID, forcing the postponement of six games already this season. The mystics behind me, they haven't played in almost two weeks. And the stars, they've only managed to play two of their six fixtures so far this season. So the teams have taken it upon themselves to play a training game here at Trust Arena tonight. And coach Rob Wright certainly isn't underestimating the value in that. You can train as much as you like, but at the end of the day, match play, there's no substitute for it. And it just gives us a real opportunity to have a look at some combos before we have to put them out on the weekend. But it's so far, so good. This week coming, all three scheduled games are set to go ahead in front of crowds. So, Andrew, it looks like the ANZ premiership might be getting back on track. Yeah, that's good news. Lucy Thompson live from Truss Arena. Thank you. Well, it's the Clash Super Rugby Pacific has been waiting for, and the Blues reckon they're in the best possible shape to topple the Crusaders in Christchurch for the first time since 2004. They'll have Roger Tuwivas' Sheck to help with that. He's recovered from a shoulder injury and ready to make an impact off the bench. Norel Sindos has more. The Blues embracing for not only a physical encounter against the Crusaders, but a psychological one as well. Belief is probably a big part of it. Dalton Papaliki isn't the only one who believes they can do something they haven't done in more than 18 years, beat the Crusaders in Christchurch. We just got to go down there and just do what we need to do to get the job done and I think there's been some good signs that we've been improving. Those signs, keeping the Chief's scoreless at the weekend. Robertson is there and he's done it. Oh, yeah, true. Their sixth straight win, hoping to make it seven on Friday, a cause strengthened by the return of Roger Tuwivas Scheck from injury. Could he be the lucky charm this weekend? I hope so. Yeah, look, I think for Roger, he just wants to get some time under his belt, but yeah, let's hope he is the lucky charm. The Crusaders haven't been at their best of late and are the first to admit it. It's just little things, you know, like decision making under pressure, discipline. I think those are the areas that we can sharpen up on this week and if we, you know, if we don't then we'll probably pay for it. While the Blues say they are in the best shape possible to do what has been for so long mission impossible. I think we are. Yeah, I think we're building this year and there's something special with this group that, you know, I felt in our previous years in patches, but it's been consistent. You know, history needs to be changed sooner or later. And for the blue's sake, let's hope that's sooner. Norelesindos News Hub. Australia's outclassed the football ferns claiming a comfortable 3-1 victory in their second international friendly. The home side was dominant from the staff. Chelsea star Sam Kerr headed home from a corner in the first 15 minutes before Haley Razzo claimed a second just two minutes later. The Ferns were able to apply some pressure when Ford Hannah Wilkinson pegged one back, showing the sort of fighting spirit. Ferns coach Yitka Klimkova is proud of. She again shows how great footballer she is and how good with the ball she is. We are looking for the positives. We are still in our beginning of our journey as a team and we are learning about ourselves. The football ferns will next appear in Europe with another international friendly against Norway. Chelsea and Real Madrid squared off in the second leg of their quarter-final this morning, producing a Champions League classic. Down 3-1 after the first leg in London, Chelsea staged an incredible comeback in Madrid. His goals from Mason-Mount, Santonia Rudigar and Timo Verna left the defending champions with a four-three aggregate lead in just 15 minutes away from a place in the semifinals. Rayal had other ideas, though. The stunning ball from Luca Modrich for substitute Rodrigo took the game into extra time, and that's when arguably the informed player on the planet made his presence felt. There's the chance of all he was bound to score. He had to score. And when they needed him most, Ben he was bound to score. He had to score. And when they needed him most, Karim Benjamin does score. Yes, Karen Benzma following up his first leg hat trick with the decisive goal to take Rayal into the last four. They'll be joined by Villa Raal, who struck in the 88th minute in Germany to secure a shock, 2-1 aggregate win over Byn Munich. And the beer got very warm for those blokes very quickly just then, didn't it? Bad news. Very good. Thank you, Andrew. He lay undiscovered for 67 million years. But now, all of a sudden, it's a race against time to reconstruct Peter, the T-Rex, in a single day. The skeletons track from the United States to Auckland's War Memorial Museum was delayed by red tape, leaving the museum's experts scrambling to piece Peter together for the all-important Easter crowds. Adam Hollingworth reports. Peter's finally here, but not necessarily in one piece. In fact, he comes with more than 200 bones, more than 100 of those original. And you can feel the anticipation at the museum. I'm incredibly excited. I've been working on bones for a long time, and to open some crates with the leg bones of the Tyrannosaurus rex this morning was really quite a moment. They are seriously big. Have you had any sleep in the last few days? We've been quite stressed here at the museum, but it's pretty much par for the course for what we do. Peter was discovered in Wyoming in 2018, almost uniquely fossilised black. He's venturing outside the United States for the first time. It's also the first time we're seeing an original T-Rex. Peter's 47% complete, which is a lot for a T-Rex. Peter's arrival in six crates from Germany was delayed by Omicron, the war in Ukraine, and customs red tape, meaning that the whole process was condensed down from five days to three, but they are on schedule. And the big decision is whether to put Peter's head on tonight or tomorrow morning. Peter's leg bears the bites of another T-Rex suggesting this apex predators the victim of cannibalism. It's got 60 teeth the size of bananas and a six-ton bite force. So that's more than three times a five-metre saltwater crocodile. It's a heart-stopping process, putting Peter together again. Some bones are spindly, some weigh as much as 40 kilos. Needless to say, someone's in trouble if something gets dropped. Yeah, definitely. But we don't really talk about it. 40 kilos. Needless to say, someone's in trouble if something gets dropped. Yeah, definitely. But we just, we don't really talk about it. T-Rexes captured the imagination like no other exhibit, and the museum hopes kids and big kids alike will come in their droves from Friday to appreciate the Majesty of the Beast. Adam Hollingworth News Hub. Absolutely. I will be there. Our top stories tonight. It's Orange for Easter. From 1159 tonight, the whole country will move to the Orange traffic line setting. Orange means no gathering limits or restrictions at all in bars and restaurants, not even masks, and school kids are only encouraged to wear them. Food prices have soared almost 8% in the past year, the biggest annual rise in a decade. Fruit and vegetables increased by a whopping 18%. Meanwhile, the inflation running rampant, the Reserve Bank has lifted the official cash rate 50 basis points in an attempt to curb spending, but rising mortgage rates will hit homeowners in the pocket too. Coming up next, New South weather, and are there still weather warnings in place for the East Coast heather? Yeah, there are. With the red, severe heavy rain warning remaining in force tonight, Gisbon's will expire at midnight and 4 a.m. tomorrow morning for the Wairoa district.

Cyclone Philly is currently sitting near the East Cape and will move away to the east tomorrow towards the Chatham Islands. The South Island's weather is influenced heavily at the moment by a huge high hanging out over the Tasman. It's extending a ridge pretty much over New Zealand tomorrow. And there is a weak trough, though, that will brush past Stewart Island. So, Tewaipo Namu, the South Island will remain fine tonight. Just the odd shower about the south coast. Fog forms early inland and will clear in the morning with the odd shower about Fjordland and the south coast, otherwise looking fine. To the Ica, Maui, the North Island, heavy rain will ease towards dawn for Gisbon and the Wairoa District and clear the wider upper completely.

To the cities, Otepoeti Deneiden looks lovely tomorrow, but it's a chilly start, especially for Mosgiel, only two degrees, with fog. The day warms nicely, though, with loads of sunshine. Fine, also north in Othotahe, Christchurch, but chilly in the morning, a lower four degrees. The wind picks up a little after lunch, too, with the north-easterly, highs hovering around the 16 mark.

Also wet for Hawks Bay and Gisbon on Sunday too, but the lead-up is mainly fine with isolated showers in the Bay of Plenty on Saturday. Not bad for the long weekend here. Shows may develop around Hora Fenua, Kapiti and Wellington on Sunday, and remain through Sunday. Friday's not bad for the top half of the south, but heavy rain does develop in the west on Saturday, and a few showers then trickle over to the east on Sunday. And Easter Friday and Easter Sunday are the better days of the weekend here, with a wet and windy day for some in between. And I did mention earlier that Queenstown and Alexandra may wake to some fog tomorrow morning, so expect a similar scene to this, taken this morning by joy, just as the fog was lifting. Beautiful, just as long as it doesn't impact those flights of Australians coming in. No, it's all good, I promise. Thank so much for that, Heather. And that is NewsHub Live at 6 for today.
