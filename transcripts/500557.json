We found that if people are severely sleep deprived, they feel loneliness much more intense sleep than they do if they're well rested. We know that students have a much lower self-esteem if they have poor sleep. We also know that it's much harder to remember things for the previous day if you get poor sleep. Now the whole point of school is that you learn all these things and you're able to remember them. If students aren't getting enough sleep, it's very difficult for them to remember things for the previous day. The big problem that we found in terms of sleep is the way it affects mental illness. For about 100 years we thought that if someone develops a mental illness, then that will affect their sleep. In the last 20 or 30 years we've started to question that, and we now think it's the other way around. We now think that when people in particular students are severely sleep deprived then that can trigger exacerbate or cause mental illness.
