Yeah, we are, Mike. He's absolutely gutted. He's gutted and he's pretty angry about what looks like really soft sentencing for the guy who killed his mate. And he's got some ideas tonight for what should happen next. The man found guilty of killing Leo Falbaki with a single punch was sentenced to just two years and nine months' jail. Leofal had been a promising MMA fighter, a husband and father to a four-year-old girl. Since Daniel Harvili's sentencing, there have been growing calls for a one-punch law like in Australia. Over there, boxer Danny Green has famously campaigned to get people to stop calling them King Hits. He prefers coward punch. Take it from me. One punch can be lethal. In New South Wales, the law's minimum sentence is eight years. Its first conviction in 2017 put an offender behind bars for more than 10. Here, LPM isn't keen on a one-punch law. When you create separate pieces of legislation, sometimes you can create unintended consequences for that. The Leophiles' friends, Fano and other fighters say that's simply not good enough. Joining us from Auckland is UFC fighter Dan Hooker, who was good mates with Fovaca and Dan, just how disappointed are you with this sentence? I'm just heartbroken with this sentence. Two years, nine months, as a sentence handed down for killing a close friend of mine, it's heartbreaking. What sentence then would have you wanted? What would have been appropriate for you? Well, we've been calling for similar sentences as the same laws that they have in Australia. They were adopted in Australia. I need to see change. That's my first major concern is this happens again. My second major concern, he's been assessed by the court system as a high risk of re-offending. Next Christmas, he will be at home with his family, serving the rest of his sentence at home and home detention. That's just the way the New Zealand system works. In two years' time, he'll be back in town with his mates and potentially does this to someone else. I don't understand. How does it get worse than this? And the judge has got, as far as I understand, the power to send someone to prison for life for manslaughter. So what's your understanding of why that didn't happen? That's... So, Jacinda Adirn, our Prime Minister, commented on this case herself. We started calling for a coward punch law, a change to the coward punch law, and she assured us that under our existing legal system, that he could be prosecuted under manslaughter with potentially a term of life imprisonment. And that her reason for not bringing in the cowd punch law was that under our current laws that he potentially you're capping the ability to send him to prison for longer well that's not the result of this case this in my opinion is the worst state of offending in a coward punch that you could possibly come if you could say anything to Daniel what would you say I don't want to say anything to him directly. I'm extremely, I'm furious about the situation. I'm extremely upset about the situation. But what martial arts has taught me is to direct my anger, direct my aggression into something constructive. So if I can direct this into a law change, direct this into potentially this not happening to someone else, this not happening to another family, to another friend, to another father, to another brother, that we don't see this kind of thing continue to happen in New Zealand is what I would attempt to draw out of the situation. Hey Dan, thanks so much. Thank you. attempt to draw out of the situation. Hey Dan, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Well, Kelder, New Zealand, welcome along for the project tonight. Please welcome Jackie Brown. Who is to be here, lovely. Jackie Brown, who is usually here on a Friday. I know. I don't know who I am. I was promised there'd be chocolate eggs. I've seen nothing. No, nothing. So it's just a bit of a weird thing. You bring the Friday vibes. I'm my best. be chocolate eggs. I've seen nothing, no buns, nothing. So it's just a bit of a weird night. Well, you bring with the Friday vibes. And I'm loving it. You've sort of been here long enough now that you don't get a special welcome. But hi Amanda. Hi Amanda. Hi Amanda. It's here. Come on. Come on. We love having you in as well. And I hope you got a lovely Easter plan. We've got a really fun show for you on the way. We do. Also tonight, murder, bitter rivalries and betrayals. Peter Fitzs Simons reveals the sordid history of the Sydney Opera House you have never heard. And Pingapate or Solomil has gone solo and is coming out with a new album. He will join us from Berlin and hopefully reassure us this isn't the end for Solomil. Beautiful. Well, before we head into Easter weekend and stuff ourselves full of chocolate hot cross buns and Jesus, it's time to stuff ourselves with laughter on the daily dose. A bit of respect, good, Jeremy. A lot of respect, absolutely. Chocolate. First up, a blatant display of favouritism and animal cruelty. Here we have a human who's got a big, delicious burger for themselves. What have they got for a little doggie? Oh. You see the bearing of the teeth? He's actually upset because he asks for no pickles. Now, I've seen a few stag fights in my time, but have you ever seen Do's fight? We'll check these two out. Here they are, sizing each other up. And obviously not getting... It's on. It's on. It is on. It is so on. It is so on. You take that. Very similar thing happens here in the green room if Jesse takes the last squiggle top. Oh, I've seen that. Yeah, it's brutal. And lastly, exciting times with the trans-Tasman bubble reopening, our Prime Minister appeared on the Project Australia to show everyone how ready we are for their visitors. Turns out we're not that ready. Can you tell the kangaroo to put his head back on. It's not seemly. Kids watch. Would you mind putting your head back off? Do you know where our other Kiwi is? Not that one. Our other Kiwi is on a break because we value our workers. I feel for that kangaroo, yeah. Four years in drama school, you end up dressed up as a kangaroo welcoming Australians back at the airport. Money well spent. That was your daily dose. Now Harry Stiles just in Timberlake, Beyonce, Michael Jackson. They all started out in famous groups but went on to find even greater success when they went solo. So will that be the case for the next Kiwi guest? Penny Patia's one-third of the platinum-selling Kiwi musical trio Solemio. For ten years they've been captivating fans with their incredible original songs and enthralling covers. Since Pene's European debut in 2019, the operatic tenor has been in hot demand overseas, recently landing the lead role in Romeo and Juliet with the San Diego Opera. And if that's not exciting enough, he's just released his debut solo album. All right, joining us now from Berlin, please welcome Penet Patti. Hey! I'm good forward. Pena, congratulations on your solo album. Were you just sick of carrying the other two? You know what? At some point, I was like, yeah, I'm going to have to do this on my own. I need to shine. I need to shine. As Beyonce was to Destiny's child, Pena is to Solimia, maybe? Don't let them two know. Let the whole of New Zealand know. to Destiny's child, Penna is to Soleimia, maybe? Don't let them too know. Let the whole of New Zealand know, but don't let those two know. And I understand you had a pretty massive role with the San Diego Opera, the lead in Romeo and Juliet. Which one were you? Well, of course, I could have been Juliet, but, you know, this time right, I was like, I'm going to be Romeo. And you know what? It was really funny. I invited some people that I randomly met on the road because they were like, oh, what are you doing here? You're an opera singer. And I said, yeah, I am. How did you know it? And I brought them home to the show, and they didn't even know it was Romeo. And they cracked up laughing when they saw me. I was like, I don't know if that's a compliment or that's the... But they loved it. They loved it. I was Romeo. That's my sixth time I played Romeo. I loved that role. Hey, so we didn't bring you on just to roast you. Why did you go solo? Why make this move now? You know what? It was always part of the group's DNA. Like, always, when we started the sort of meal, we're like, everyone pursue your own career. Like, get the badges on your laparre. And the whole beauty of it is that you have three individually successful guys who form the group rather than the group keeping this together. You know what I mean? Tell you what, you're going pretty well. You just finished up with an opera in Paris. Tonight, you're in Berlin. Can I ask, do you reckon you bring a bit of a Kiwi twist or a Pacifica twist to these roles? Absolutely. And I think it's because in New Zealand or in the Pacifica, you're nurtured to sing. It's just part of who you are, you know what I mean? Whereas a lot of the European side or American side, you're taught to sing. And there's a massive difference here because then now you're showing a different part of you where in America and Europe, you're kind of like showing off your talent. Whereas the Pacific side, it's more like, here's my story. And it changes the game a lot because people get emotionally invested rather than I paid the big bucks to hear your high notes. Come out and sing those high notes. I know you can't sing for us, but your voice is so great, so magical. I was wondering if we could get you to, well, I think maybe, can you thank yourself for being on the project tonight? Thank you to me. Thank you, thanks for joining us. You're a good sport. Thank you to me. Thank you for joining us. Thank you, guys. Oh, dear. I've got a problem now. I think I'm just about to crush. Oh, he's just... Totally get it? You know, like he's eloquent, he's talented, he's handsome. He'd, mate, you go to the opera. Yeah, I would. Sorry to my husband. This is coming a real problem on the project. Last night it was Amanda with Josh Brolin. You see her the noises she was making during the interviews. Oh, I'm with Amanda. He's hot. Yeah, he's totally hot. Can I just say, I would listen to a recording of not only his singing, but also his giggling. Yeah, he's so delightful. Yeah, and his new self-titled album is out now.

Premier Sunday, April 24 on 3 and 3 now. Welcome back. We have some incredible stories for you tonight, like how a fundraiser for the Sydney Opera House led to one of the most shocking murders in the history of Australia. Peter Fitzsimons is going to tell us that one and some other stories about the iconic building's secret history next. But before that, New Zealand officially has had its first Maff's baby. I know it's so sweet. You might remember last year we told you that married at first sight, New Zealand contestants, Brett and Angel, were expecting. The couple from the 2017 show were the only couple to remain together and they have just had their baby. They posted on Instagram that little Vienna had arrived into the world seven pounds, nine ounces and 53 centimetres long. their baby. They posted on Instagram that little Vienna had arrived into the world 7 pounds 9 ounces and 53 centimetres long. Just delightful. Just can't wait for the confession cam with the baby though. Yeah, she really doesn't seem like my sort of mum. My first impression was bit loud. That'll be a beautiful baby just like her parents. They're so lovely, Brett and Angel and I reckon it really shows a difference between Australia and New Zealand. You know what the latest season of maths was like with the Australians? Oh, dirty, in the gutter. I loved every second of it. Totally with you. But this news, I feel cleansed. I feel refreshed. Go New Zealand. Go love. Okay, back to Australia now because Sydney's Opera House, with its distinctive white sails, is one of the world's most iconic landmarks. But our next guess is it's also the setting for some really juicy secrets and scandals. Built on a sacred site for the Gatigal people, a gathering place for storytelling and ceremony for 60,000 years. The Sydney Opera House started construction in 1959 and is now one of the world's most recognisable buildings. But a new book by Peter Fitzsimon shows the path to completion was paved with betrayal, breakdowns and even murder. Danish architect Juen Utson stunned the judges of a worldwide competition with its daring design. But it was then plagued by delays, budget blowouts and even bullying by a politician. Are you staying again? He quit and a local architect had to finish the job. And in 1960, when a lottery was held to raise money for the build, it led to one of the country's most infamous crimes. The Opera House was finally opened by Queen Liz in 1973 and is now acknowledged as a masterpiece and feat of human ingenuity Wow Yes the author of the Opera House book Peter Fitzsionns joins us now from Sydney Gooday Peter Tell me what was so special about the structure the Danish architect came up with it was extraordinary then it's extraordinary now I wanted to I'm going to use rhyming slang I wanted to call the book The Opera use rhyming slang. I wanted to call the book, The Opera House, comma, where the ruck did that thing come from? It is amazing. In 1950s Australia, we were surrounded by a white picket fence. We didn't understand the concept of multiculturalism. We ate meat and three veg. We went to church on Sundays, we were one of the dullest places on earth. And yet, this concept, this thing was put on the cabinet table of 16 whitefellas of the New South Wales cabinet, and they went, yeah, yeah, we'll build that bastard. So talk us through it. So he was commissioned in 1959 and then it was finished in 73. What was the hold-up? The problem was, it looked exquisite as it does now, but when the engineer said, well, how do we build it? Well, that answer was not forthcoming because when they said, well, what is the curves, what's the shape of the shells? He got a plastic ruler, bedded and said, that shape, and it doesn't work like that. So it took a long time to work out how to realise the actual concept, to make the concept stand up. I've had many a fun night at your Opera House, and I love it. But I understand a lottery to fund the building led to the murder of a young boy. Tell us more, Peter. Tragic story. They had the Opera House lottery. Everybody wins £100,000 if they win it. And we put the winners on the front page of the paper and the eighth family to win it. Here they are, the Thorn family of Bondi. They've won £100,000. Terrific. Three days later, they send their eight-year-old little boy off to school, snatched off the streets, kidnappers' letter. They found the body a month later. Absolutely tragic. Peter, like many iconic buildings, not always may be appreciated. When did the Sydney Opera House go from being hated to being loved? That's a fascinating question. Initially, there was an outcry. The Daily Mirror had a letter to the editor, which was emblematic of what everybody thought. This looks like the giant collection of toe clippings of a giant albino dog. And yet when they started to build the arches, that's when people looked at it and went just wow, wow, this thing looks just fantastic. I don't know what it means, but it's like a giant sculpture. It's like an artwork in and of itself. You spin a great yarn. Peter, Thanks very much for joining us this evening. Thank you. I was just thinking, do we have anything like the Sydney Opera House here in New Zealand? Not like that. Skytower is pretty iconic, isn't it? Yeah. People love it, people hate it. It went for sort of being hated to love, but it's still a tower, do you what I mean? It's not basic. Yeah, I think Sydney's got one and Vancouver's got one. What about our beehive? That's pretty cool and iconic. Yeah, that's a bit different. I'm feeling, we need something, don't we? We definitely need a new, something. Like an Auckland Opera House. Yes, if you're watching a new architect, can you please make a thing? Yeah, but could the rest of us ever agree? No, we never agree. That's why we have so many boxes as buildings because that's the most efficient way to build space. Now, Jazz Thornton, she's an author, filmmaker, she's even met Prince Harry. And she's on The New Dancing with the Stars. But before all that, though, jazz went through a battle with mental illness, which is how she ended up in her GP's office trying to get pills to end her life. Now, she and that GP are telling this story. I'd been struggling for a really long time and had just kind of got to the point where I was like, I can't do this anymore, I don't want to do this anymore. And I ended up making an appointment to go see Dr. Stead. But trying to do it, I didn't want to tell her what I was actually planning on doing. I just wanted to try and get what I needed to finish the job. Jazz was just sitting in in my office, unfortunately, like a lot of patients that we see, wasn't making any eye contact, really didn't want to say a lot, and trying to question her wasn't getting anywhere. I remember going in, thinking that I was putting up a really good act that she didn't know but she saw straight through it. The challenge as a GP is you have a 15-minute consultation. Well, I think I spent about 90 minutes with her that day because I knew that I had to try everything I could. Instead of giving jazz the the prescription she was after, Dr Steph sent her to the hospital. But it was what Steph said that day that really shaped Jazz's future. She kept saying that, you know, there's hope for your future, you don't have to live like this, like this doesn't define you. And it was so weird for me to hear that because medical professionals had never said that to me. I really didn't think that she was listening. And that's the one really amazing thing that I've learned through our relationship now is that she heard everything I said. But it was a while before Dr. Steph found that out. When Jazz came back to see me, to be honest, I didn't know what had happened to her. I hadn't seen her for, I think it was about a year and a half, maybe two years. Jazz was in the midst of filming for her doco, the girl on the bridge. She said that the cameras were following her around everywhere she went, and I was like, well, where are they? And she said, well, clearly they're not here now. She was like, okay, so what are you doing this weekend? And I was like, oh, I'm actually going to have coffee with Prince Harry and Megan Markle. And she's at this point, she's like, oh, I'm actually going to have coffee with Prince Harry and Megan Markle. And at this point, she's like, oh, okay. And she thought I had gone off the rails again. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Writing in my notes, like, she was, was she manic? What was going on here? Like, I didn't kind of get it. Then I was at home watching television. There she was, having coffee, literally, with Prince Harry and Megat Markle and representing voices of hope. And I was like, oh my gosh, she's actually achieved what she set out to do. That's so awesome. Pretty soon, Jazz and Dr. Steph's doctor-patient relationship became a collegial one. She actually said, I'd really like to tell our story and get it from the doctor's perspective and get it from the patient's perspective. And I said, yeah, yeah, I'm happy to do that. And then she phoned me up not yeah, yeah, I'm happy to do that. And then she phoned me up not long later saying, I'm going to Bali to talk to a group of mental health advocates. Would you like to come with me? So, of course I said yes. And before long, that working relationship became a friendship. We have a different relationship. I'm no longer her GP anymore. She's no longer my patient. And she's kind of become like part of our family. I've got three daughters who look up to her as the big sister and she spends a lot of time at our house. Her and her family just became like family to me. They invited me to go on their family holiday with them. They were teaching me to surf and to ski. And it gave me, yeah, family. That's a really beautiful story, and they are beautiful woman, and I like it. There's one word that I think can sum it up, and that is hope, and it is just life-changing. And, you know, for Jazz, she is voice of hope, and I think it's incredible. Yeah. If you ever feel like you need to have a conversation with someone about some of this stuff, there's a helpline number on our screen. And if you or anyone you know is going through a tough time, you can check out Jazz's amazing book, Letters to You. That's me holding it there, and I've just earmarked a few beautiful pages I found. There are things in here that she's written about to read when you're struggling with grief, which is also, you know, we'll go through that, and it's hard. You don't really know what to do or her to turn to read when you're struggling with grief, which is also, you know, we'll go through that and it's hard. You don't really know what to do or who to turn to read when you don't feel like you are enough is another really great one. So get yourself a copy of that and have a read. Really helpful and beautiful. Thank you for doing that, Jazz. Awesome. Thanks, Jackson. There is more to come on the project. Thank you. They're the cring of Cuey comedy.
