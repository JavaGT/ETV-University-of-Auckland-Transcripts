But he's the Kaihoutu the chief executive of te tapuay or rehua based down in Christchurch I'm not going to steal too much of his thunder he's got a beautiful koreiro laid out for us today about how we can all work together to achieve results so I use it in that language because he's got some flasher language through there without further due to thank you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for you today. Thank you very so. Thank you. Now, here, my name of Auraki Moca Pauauau Rukh, and Racka, ta'ra to come on you on this ma'amata and now, I'm here my name My Rāka Thouka, to come up to you at this moment. So, the Farno of Tuimatera, here I'm here, my name for you. Tohue, I've given the reo-pourri to me to come to whinemue to you. Teneran, Couto, all, the poe, and the tumour of our house, and here I'ma my name is Hiroa Taerua, Tarina. As there and said, my mother is a staunch Naitahu, Nātāpāau, the Fanawa-Apunui woman, from the sterling Fanao and Fanawa'u Nātāpani-Prao as well, Te-Aura, so the Nihon-Niho Fanao and then a much softer chilled-out, very quiet and I'm well, Solomon Fano from Tua Hiwi in Naitahue. Links all throughout Naitahue and the east coast. On my father's side, Nati Pakeakey Ingerang, so my father was an immigrant from Tobiton, so he really used to watch last of the summer wine. That's kind of just over the hill where he's from. Blended fakoppa. But I'ma thank you. Just a little bit about myself, so really, I've come through, grown up in Kauarao, all over the place, they're plenty. But Fano's from Oteutahe, from Christchurch. So I moved back there when I was a teenager. Not sure if you were the likes of Ti'i Puanaki and then Tiakas are some of those storeworks in terms of Tereo. So I was educated in a bilingual high school, Aramu. And then from there we went into a university studying Tereo Māori. And from there I actually worked in the electronics factory in the holidays, had the Kawemate for my pao, my grandfather, and so wrote a whole bunch of letters trying to get a job and ended up getting one reply from Naitahu. And so I started work for the Iwi pre-settlement when it was the Naitahu Māori Trust Board. There were about eight staff. I was related to about seven of them. And really got a chance to see an Iwi pre-settlement and then the rapid growth post-settlement. And then from there I left the I a couple years later, worked in the polytech sector, running a finishing school basically for young Māori in a tertiary space and then went back into working for the Iwi in 2006. Worked in terms of leading the real and culture teams and then worked for the whole-eat companies. They're doing something quite different and then in a tourism company and then post-quake moved into Tapua or I suppose the rough course of the journey is, I think I've had a pretty good term in terms of working with the iwi, from when it was small to when it is much bigger today, and then the week really sort of spanning cultural and commercial. And that's, I think, generated a lot of wisdom for me in terms of understanding the full breadth of iwi and our complexities. So where I work at today is the Tapawa O'Rejo. I'd say it's one of the renegade subdivisions of subsidiaries of Terunangua or Naito. So I'm going to talk a little bit about partnership which is sort of the brief I was given. I thought it's quite interesting to have a chance to speak about collaboration and it's something that we all talk about but we really sort of actually get a chance to articulate for what that could mean so I suppose if you look at Naitahu the Iwi from the start has very much adapted a partnership strategy and that's because of our context. We're not remote and isolated, we're spread out, so we're geographically diverse, we have a couple mountain ranges in between us and our corona and we are quite small in terms of our population. So in that basis we've always worked on a partnership strategy working with our local communities to advance shared goals. So it's something that Iwi has been trying to develop. It fits our context and it fits kind of the wierro of our leaders if you think of ones like Sir Mark Solomon, who very much exhibits those kinds of qualities in terms of collaboration. As I said, collaboration is a nice word, but it's sort of like when people talk about it, it's sort of like the bogeyman walking around in the hills in the sense that you don't really know what collaboration is like until it's not dead. So when you don't have a strong collaboration, you know when you're not in a collaborative space. And so as in Hiwi, in terms of Tatawa'aureho, we've really tried to sort of find what kinds of bodies of literature, what kind of tools are there to assist in terms of developing strong partnerships and collaborations to advance iwi and Māori groups. No one ever knew what I did, and to a large degree people still don't. I've had a career basically where I've led in manners cross-disciplinary teams. So whether it be property developers and carvers or educationists and artists or creative designers, that's kind of no matter where I work those are the toolpits I've had. And so I always wanted to try and articulate to my wife what I actually did, because people just saw me as the person that did stuff, or a go-to person. And so when I read the collective impact article, it was an article in 2011 from the Stanford Journal of Social Innovation. It was, for the first time, something it kind of clearly articulated, oh, this is what I do as a job. So printed off, showed my wife. She saw it was six pages, time something that kind of clearly articulated oh this is what i do as a job so printed off showed my wife she saw it was six pages wasn't really that interested but yeah what we've looked at really is trying to understand structured and frameworks for collaboration so when you get into it it sounds all warm and fuzzy in my experience the collaboration from an hewe level has been quite a tense space it's a domain of conflict and hasn't been an easy road and so we've tried to sort out wisdom in ways in which we can kind of empower ourselves a bit better so collective impact is a quite a buzzword in a social sector and the NGO sector and it's an opportunity to have a bit of a shared vocab around collaboration and what that can mean, how we can work together to advance shared goals. So it is a Western framework and so part of that is recognizing that there are potential opportunities for that to inform and empower Māori communities, but there are also potential risks around Māori losing control of the agenda. And so that's something I wanted to talk about today. It was really explaining a little bit about Teta'uai, talking about collective impact as a structural approach to collaboration. What are some of the risks for Māori and what are some of the potential opportunities and enable this? Apai for Mahama? So just a really brief explanation but I think I was probably 18 or so at the time when Tapewai was formed. So in 1998 a wee while ago. Yeah, our Iwi was really sort of faced with a choice around do we go down a waninga path? Do we create our own institution? One of our issues we have in our region is just our spread. So if we were to create our own wananga, we would probably still be arguing over whether it was where it was to be based. And and so really the iwi adopted a partnership strategy so to maximize the impact of the iwi was quite ambitious in terms of its aspirations looked at how do we work with these these big structures these tertiary institutions so to tapawa or rehua as an iwi- partnership. It's where the two treaty partners come together in a shared space. So it's owned by both Tangata Teriti, Tangata Finua. So you have Maitehu on one side representing Tangata Finnoa, and then you have the tertiary partners who are Lincoln, Canabry, Otago University, at Christchurch Polytech and Otago Polytech. So we kind of exist in a shared space which is co-owned by all of the partners. So I have lots of different bosses in that sense. I point out in terms of our collaborative partnerships, we've probably been on that pathway for about four years. I have gone to a couple of conferences and they've talked a lot about collaboration and they said, next thing we're going to probably start next year. So I lost a lot of faith when I go, we actually haven't initiated so you don't really understand the complexities. So I'd say that we've been kind of four or five years down the path. So some of our partnerships, they kind of all have a similar formula where we work with multi-sector groups or cross-sector groups. So we will often have one to two government funding agencies or government partners, agency partners, industry partners, tertiary partners and community. So we tend to try to avoid having too many from one sector in the partnership because that often changes the dynamics to competitive. sector in the partnership because that often changes the dynamics to competitive. But we have partnerships in terms of Māori trades which is probably a big one, Māori agriculture, professional learning and development, Maukita Apo which employs about 70 staff. So these consortiums can be quite large and can be quite scale and then some of them are much smaller so we have simple things like a Bachelor sorry an applied management degree really focusing on what I staff and getting them upskilled within their own workplace I suppose the timing of their discussion in terms of collective impact, which came out about 2011, but really what you sort of saw was it was an alignment of the stars in a sense of hewey really starting to focus a lot stronger on social agendas, on a social change agenda, sorry. So if you think of for us post settlement we probably spent the first 10 years trying to consolidate economically and it's a nice way of saying not glowing the money which you know what's the expectations that most people had with those early settlements that Māori that we weren't capable of managing assets and yeah we're at great risk. So our Iwi were very conservative. After consolidating economically, you have a sort of period of political consolidation. So Iwi are very much trying to focus on how they can convert their commercial economic power into influence to support their aspirations around social change. and what you sort of see was really the you know the big challenge for iwi is to actually go how can we actually affect social change social progress how can we create tangible things for our people to recognize that we are advancing their aspirations forward. So much of our community proceeds Kiwi as corporations, and really they're more like charities that make their own money. You know, they have two fundamental purposes. One is the maintenance of collective capital intergenerationally, and the other is the maintenance of collective cultural identity intergenerational. It just so happens that those two purposes are conflicting and clashing and it is the maintenance of collective cultural identity intergeneration. It just so happens that those two purposes are conflicting and clashing and it's the big challenge for but wicked problems. So when you're dealing with issues in terms of iwi, you're trying to look at how to solve complex social problems. There isn't necessarily, if you think of Māori achievement, there isn't necessarily one technical solution that you can deploy. They're complex, they have multiple lenses and require multiple sectors to contribute to those answers. So a lot of the aspirations for Iwi, they'll have an education component, they'll have a cultural component, they'll have a cultural component, they'll have an environmental lens and economic sustainability lens. So we were trying to grasp how do you bring all of those different sectors or spheres together in a manageable way and not have everyone tearing each other apart, which is probably some of our early forays. It sounds so simple, you know, the key thing about Iwi is change, but it's the biggest problem we have with all of our partnerships, that everyone signs up for partnership with an Iwi expecting business as usual. So, you know, really that Iwi are about systems change and whether it be an education initiative about looking at position and cultural responsiveness with the thinking that when we grow cultural responsiveness we'll grow Māori participation very mighty achievement grow mighty success and progression. That's one of the biggest issues that we tend to have attention point in terms of our partnerships that people sign up for partnership but aren't fully aware or understanding that part of that will mean by the nature of collaboration is transformational that the Iwi will change the communities will change that our partners will change as a result of the collaboration and through an evaluative data that's the key learning that we've made I've got a PhD I can say now in Indigenous organisation design and that's my key diagram to explain the nature of EOW in terms of as an institution as an organisation. And the key thing is that Iwi have their fingers in Evipai very ambitious and strategically overloaded. So one of the key things for Iwi is really trying to grasp how to balance contrasting priorities. And the big challenge at the moment that I think everyone's trying to grasp is that sort of whole feeling around the economic agenda, overpowering or being detrimental to that cultural agenda. So again, I would say that indigenous organizations or iwi are incredibly complex because they are trying to do a lot at the same time of very limited resources. So in terms of our experience, as I said, we embraced emergence. Just another nice way of saying that, you know, that Ermi's kind of been winging it without any theoretical or guiding ideas. So we've gone down a pathway right from EREDIL settlement and prior to that in terms of partnership. How do we work together? And just that basic idea that, hey, we can do more if we work together than we can if we work in silos. And so that EWI deliberately decides when it will strategically engage in a partnership with partners that have influence over an area that is aligned with Huey priorities and at times they will also disengage pull back or not try to spread themselves too thin. So in terms of collective impact as I said collaboration is hard it's not innate it's an art form to pull off well. And so what we've really tried to do is to find out what are some ideas, some methods, some tools that can help us. Collective impact, as I said, is a structured framework for collaboration. So it's designed around how to create meaningful, long-term social change and do that, bringing together the strengths, knowledge, skills sets of multiple sectors. For Marama, as I said, similar to the hewe, that simple, understated, the underlying principle that makes it much more sense if we align and work together than if we are working across or against each other. So I think that's a very Māori concept. In terms of collective impact, you kind of have, as I said, five key conditions which are focused around the first one there, so common agenda. So really working with a very diverse group of community voices and coming up with a shared vision for change. So there's real simple things of understanding having a shared agreement around what the problem is that you're trying to solve. These can sound very simple, but when you don't have them in there, you can have quite different philosophical understandings of a partnership. We had one in our evaluative data in terms of a partnership with the agricultural sector, and we're all talking about Māori leadership. And for those communities, Māori leadership meant everyone was leaders, and that we were about supportingori leadership and for those communities Māori leadership meant everyone was leaders and that we were about supporting each person and participants to reach their potential whereas some of the industry partners, Māori leadership for them meant taking the cream of the crop at the top leaving everyone else behind so again shared understandings is really key in having that dialogue up front so shared vision for change the second part is shared data measurement so again identifying one of those key performance indicators those things that you can influence in terms of change in terms of shifting the dial mutually reinforcing activities so having a shared plan of action, so basically having coordinated activities across the different partnership or collaborating entities. Kappaika Marama. Continuous communication, so I'd say that that's probably one of the chief currencies in terms of our partnerships, that if you don't have a good flow of information, then you start to hemorrhage trust, then everything starts going toxic fast. So how to privilege and ensure the flow of information, because when you think about collaboration, you're creating a model of interdependency, and that's only going to work if everyone understands what everyone else is doing and how we are linked together What's called a backbone support organisation So in terms of Tatawaa rejuwa we are positioning and learning but positioning ourselves as a backbone support organisation So that means you have a very lean and mean team that have designated full time to the initiative. So in terms of, as I said, the Moki Taako, culturally responsive professional learning and development partnership, there are about 70 people employed and we have one person based within EW. We would like more, obviously, but part of the model is it's about ensuring that you're not sort of taking away and taxing the delivery of initiatives. You're trying to create a small type designated resource to ensure collaboration occurs to manage the activity. This is just a real simple graphic from the Tamarack Institute, but I like it a lot because it looks at really a continuum of collaboration. So often when we talk about collaboration, we kind of might be starting a bit further down the scene. So most of our partnerships, when we start, we will often have quite a competitive environment. So we might have different partners that might be at best coexisting, we might be competing with each other for funding. And over time we start to think about, well, how do we align our activities together? So the basic, yeah, the what we do doesn't change, we just are working off a shared plan. So we are coordinating our activities. And then progressively, we start to look at collaboration. And again, that key driver of change. So what is the difference with collaboration? It's that the actual nature of delivery starts to shift. You'll start to, the collaboration starts to affect shifts in practice. Not quite. We talked to one of our partnerships recently. As I said, they were instructed that the new logic was going to be about collaboration and they asked the fund why and they said I don't know our minister just told us so again it's one of those things that when you get into that sometimes it can be okay just to coordinate or cooperate it won't necessarily require the complexity of integration or collaboration you can still achieve your goals that's not a one-size so I'm not advocating it's a one-size fitzall. But I think when you start to look about cross-cultural partnership or cross-cultural collaboration, the complexity jumps. And you're trying to think of normally a minority indigenous culture with a majority power culture. Those dynamics are very different. And so you're probably looking more in terms of the complexity of this year how do you handle that complexity we should have a better diagram but kind of what do they look like cascading levels of collaboration and so often in terms of our partnerships we have a steering group, which, yeah, if we can we have a very influential champion. So that Māori trades is He Tiki Ptiki. So Mark Solomon is our champion. His impact is huge in terms of our partnership. We have a steering group where we privilege Māori in terms of governance. So we have Iwi representation, we have Tatawai, then we have all of the partners as well. So we're, in terms of say, Hetuki, we have an industry-led model with industry and tertiary, and we're just bringing in a sort of Fana-O big as well, Colin, to the kaukata. So each of them have a steering group. They have their strategic action framework. So they set their vision for change. They set their strategic goals, sort of a theory of change model. What are the conditions we would need to achieve, to achieve our ultimate goal, and they have working groups. And so each of those working groups are focused around a particular area of mahi and they are made up of all of the different members, community members of the partnership. And then you kind of have the partners themselves and the community members. And so the backbone organisation, like our role, we work at a strategic level and at the operational level so we're sort of the glue that ties the partners across and then up and down and not the easiest though and I suppose what we see is in terms of our role in terms of having an indigenous hub for collaboration to start to think about well what role can iwi play in terms of being the natural partner for a hub for collaboration in a sense that iwi have broad strategic interests but don't necessarily have a lot of skin in the game so yeah we have commercial interests but often have commercial partnerships more than we would have commercial competitors. So in terms of that backbone organization guiding strategy, which is a key thing, and I would say probably sort of being that cultural backbone for the initiative maintaining the cultural integrity of the kāpapa. And one of the advantages we have is that in terms of our partnership, we can leverage the strengths of big partners, but we're also a charitable not-for-profit, so we can mobilize as we can. So if I think of it in terms of an image, you know, having a wicked problem, having really diverse cross-sector voices, and they can be in terms of whether they be commercial or industry, community, papakana, tertiary or environmental, and really because of that, the thinking would be that you have a much deeper more meaningful solution to the problem. Ka'paai? So working with Māori and collaborations with iwi are different and as much as we've learnt about collective impact we also note that there are key gaps in there. And when you think about that, one of the biggest gaps, I would say, is power. And, you know, a collective impact model is kind of a culturally neutral model for collaboration. And when you're dealing with a lot of our communities that have been marginalised, you have to address the balance of power. Or you should say you have to find ways of designing how to redress the balance of power. Culture, again, this comes up because it's a cross-cultural partnership that you have those cross-cultural tensions at times. So that's one thing that we're trying to figure out in terms of what is unique about a collaboration, a kāpāpa Māori collaboration, a Kaupato Māori partnership. What qualities would make it different? Because even though the literature supposes it's culture-free, we know that's not the case. And when you're sitting around the table, you can definitely provide plenty of examples of when there is that difference in terms of thinking. Disruption. So as I said, when you go to a, I've found even with collective impact or collaborative conferences, it sounds very much kumbaya, everyone sits around a campfire holding hands. And we do have that, but we also have tension, and we've come to the point now, even with our evaluative data, we know that's actually a sign of progress. So if everyone is in agreement, then we know we're actually not having a disruptive impact, that we're not changing anything. And so if we're not affecting system change then there's no points of their collaboration and I'd say one thing in terms of iwi or Māori communities when your accountability is there if you're not making any progress step the aunties are pretty good at telling me and then really this thing of not so much decolonization, I think there's one word. I would probably use de-institutionalize. So what you have in terms of our communities is big institutions of power that are quite rigid by nature. And the pace of change in our communities is increasing. And so we've found that a lot of our partnerships create a shared space where change can occur at a faster rate than it could occur within the institutions themselves. So in terms of a lot of our partnerships, it's not that these institutions couldn't do a lot of that stuff themselves, but they don't have the competencies in terms of adaptation or in terms of creativity or innovation. And what you can see, what's starting to emerge probably in the last month, is even in some of the literature around collaboration and looking at that model, that it's actually become very much a top-down model. So what you can see are examples of alliances of providers, all from the same sort of space. And so rather than having multiple sectors represented, you see the same sector partners represented so you have the same perspective so there's no sort of contest or tension and I think the the risks are that you could actually be quite a negative experience for some indigenous communities and we're seeing that with in a Native American a few cases where you've actually had church groups go form a collective impact initiative around social change for Native American communities, very efficient, very effective, but those communities are total passengers and it's been a, I suppose, a more efficient way of colonising those communities as opposed to empowering them, letting them design their own aspirations. So there are risks there as well. Not sure if anyone's familiar with Game of Thrones. Yeah, and that's, I think, one of the risks in terms of our governance entities, those steering groups, they're aware of, and we're always trying to keep a mindful watch on, and you can have outcomes and deliverables and outputs, but you don't necessarily affect meaningful long-term change for a community. So if anyone's familiar with Game of Thrones, Phaelisi frees all the slaves but doesn't actually address any of their circumstances the dynamics of power and so eventually all the slaves want to go back into slavery because at least they get three meals a day. Spoiler a loop. And as I said that whole thing around Keep Calm and Kumbaya. So probably in our early stages when attention occurred, we started to think, what are we doing wrong? Because the dialogues, the conferences, or even in the literature, it was all very much warm and fuzzy. And what we were encountering were hot points and we know that our job was to take the heat out of the situation but it's starting to understand that if you're talking about system change then just by nature people resist change institutions resist change but sometimes tension can be a sign of progress as opposed to a negative. And just that whole thing around equity. So that's the ultimate thing we're trying to address, then it's around how do we configure to grade equity as opposed to equality. And the key thing is that when you're dealing with these communities, even around the table, not every one of those voices has had the same starting point that there are always assumptions of privilege of power you know the institutions will jump to making all the calls we had there yesterday actually where we had a put up attention point with one of our steering groups and one of the tertiary partners said well you know I feel underrepresented because you know I feel like a lone voice and the community members didn't have a lot of sympathy and we talked about it a lot but for them that was the one place where there was actually a minority in a steering group and so they felt they were actually empowered for the one time in their life and so we talked that through and it was good but again part of that is for these And so they felt they were actually empowered for the one time in their life. And so we talked that through and it was good. But again, part of that is for these communities or when you're dealing with hapu or Fano clusters or industry groups, that there were always those assumptions from the bigger entities around power and you've got to try and balance that out in terms of collaboration. Otherwise, the other partners get frustrated, hoaxe, and strategically disengaged. As I said, we haven't figured it out yet. But we're trying to think about, well, what does, what would a Kaukāā Māori approach to collaboration with what? And starting to think about, well, how do you privilege a Māori agenda, Māori aspirations or Iwi aspirations, and how do you work with Māori and non-Mari groups, institutions, different sectors to progress those aspirations? And so, yeah, some of those key underlying ideas that, you know, if you're collaborating with Māori, then we should have an emancipatory approach, you know, to thinking that, you know, if those communities that are plagued by an issue, know best what the solutions are. And it's our job to figure out how we can articulate or paraphral or make visible those solutions and how we can articulate or paraphran, make visible those solutions and how we can use our influence and power to progress them. So, yeah, working across whether it would be technology, commercial space, business, environmental, whatever you need in terms of your areas of influence to achieve your goal, but to create an outcome that is emancipatory that empowers that community yeah I think I was on a full bride and I went to all of these lovely conferences while I was there about poverty and practice and people were stepping over all the homeless people to get into the venue and you saw partnerships and consortiums around how do they efficiently manage homelessness as opposed to try and tackle the underlying causes behind it. And I know that's a complex issue, but again, these are some of the assumptions that we don't want to repeat ourselves in terms of an Iwi to think, well, how do we have an mandatory approach? Because ultimately, Yiwi are accountable to Fano and there's quite a tight loop in terms of those accountability. I should have mentioned at the start with the kawa normally when I always took this top-corn or gakau-hihiko so if you do have anything you want to add fewer might just let me know I just thought just in terms of what are some of the enablers so you we have a team of eight so as I said we're quite lean and mean we have about team partnerships but we have a full-time evaluative researchers so that's the amount of value that we place on a good qualitative research to inform continual improvement. And one of the key things we've found is just the whole generative potential of conflict. It sounds crazy and perverse. But really recognising that the strength of a collaborative model is having different voices, different perspectives. And that when you sit down at the same table, you have to talk a lot more. So collaboration is a lot slower because decision making is shared. But part of the boon of that is that you're generating more understanding of each other and each other's perspectives. So when you're sitting around that table, you're learning, you're creating more understanding of each other and each other's perspectives. So when you're sitting around that table, you're learning, you're creating a shared space, and that conflict, that rubbing up, that polish, when you have those different perspectives coming together, that's a source of learning, a source of innovation, and that's where all the good stuff comes from as I said a key thing for us is around how do we ensure and use we use collaborative impact as a structural tool to address imbalances of power and so we use those tools to figure out well how do we address those imbalances in power. And so we use those tools to figure out, well, how do we address those imbalances and ensure that decision-making is shared across the group, and accountabilities are shared as well. So we centralise those accountabilities with Hewi. We have the partners come on board, and Iwi's agenda is privileged, so they will often be positioned as Iwi's agenda is privileged so they will often be positioned as Iwi lead and in terms of governance in terms of steering groups how do you ensure that that cultural voice or that agenda is never marginalised? Similar t'aque there. As I said, it's probably like anything, but relationships and trust are the currency that you trade on. And at times, as I said, our role as a backbone is to invest into that, but also at times we have to make tough strategic calls about how do we privilege that either the cultural agenda, the iwi aspirations, or just sort of hold the line in some cases. So I had an uncomfortable conversation yesterday when we were doing something similar. So really, that key thing around trust is always trying to invest. Sometimes you might make a bit of a slip-up and might make a withdrawal, but it's always around how do you invest in surveys open lines of dialogue with your partners. If I could track attention, yeah normally as I said in our collaborative partnerships it starts off we're on a high with a signing of the EMOU and everything's going fantastic and it normally hits to the point where we start to talk about logos and that's when you have the first point of change well actually our agency branding guide is all about orange and someone we're all our corporate branding guide is all about green and it's a Māori initiative so we want it to look Māori okay and so you start to get back contest and that's that first point to change that when you're naming something when you're defining what it looks like you're creating an identity and so with all of our partnerships we create a shared identity that sits in the middle that we all own. So it's not something as owned by Naito, owned by industry, owned by agency, owned by a partner. It sits in the middle. And that helps because it means it sits outside of the organisation. So it doesn't have to conform with regulations or branding laws. But more important, it's about creating something that is co-owned by all of the partners there. doesn't have to conform with regulations or brain linguists. But more important, it's about creating something that's co-owned by all of the partners there. So it's a shared brand, a shared tohu, and really it creates its own shared identity. And as the ones are matured, you start to see them that they form their own shared culture, their collaborative practice. So they have a way of doing things as I said the endurance talking about the other potential opportunities about engaging with with Iwi in terms of collaborative possibilities one of the key things is I suppose if you're really doing something exciting and energising then you're going to have to sort of condition yourselves for failure as well that in terms of innovation you know or creativity doing something for the first time you don't normally get that right the first time so it's about creating a high level of trust that you can talk about those vulnerabilities at those uncomfortable conversations because we see our collaborative models as problem solving frameworks. So by definition, everything's not working right. Yeah, we've got to solve those problems and we tend to sort of scaffold our way through a hierarchy of problem solved. So the problems that we are engaged with now aren't the ones we had four years ago, but we were always still trying to focus on that growth. I think in coming back to it, when you're talking about, from more of an Iwi perspective, ewee tend to be doing everything for the first time. So they're embarking into new areas, especially if you look at the horizons around the appetite and expectations around social change, around entrenching cultural values within Ewee organizations. These are all new frontiers for hew. And so I wouldn't expect that it's going to be a smooth right because as I said we're not dealing with technical problems where there are simple predictable technical solutions you're dealing with social problems with wicket problems that have a high level of complexity and very low levels of predictability and as I said just the last one sounds so simple but out of our team of aid, we have one evaluative research that just cycles her way around each of the project. So when we start to get a high point of tension, when we know we need to really start to dig in there, then we can task someone to look at that sort of qualitative research. So we do a lot of formative evaluation so probably one thing we've learned is probably in the first six months to a year of initiation we need to have an evaluation just purely focused on how are we working together do we have a strong model of collaborative practice because if we don't do it early, tensions build up and create more problems. And we're starting to get, Lepenka, first amateur, our impact evaluation to look at, well, what's the actual, what have we achieved, what outcomes have we made, and what shifts in practice have we seen within our partner institutions. I'm here, I'm here, and I just want to open it up if there were any Patae or a Faka'aou. Any questions? I'm not a question, but a comment. I just wanted to say thank you so much for your presentation. I got so much out of this and it's something that I've maybe read a little bit of theory about, but hearing your experience and practice has just been eye-opening. And I think I was just identifying a lot as you were talking, especially about the complexity of issues. And I loved the point about teaching as a sign of change, so not something that is accepted as a part so yeah Kerah thank you I'm here you know me ki up we you know you know probably the other than the what's good Deng Pāpaatho this one question you mentioned that you can to make some some pretty strict strategic decisions. Has they ever met like actually withdraw from a particular collective impact? I don't know what we call it, from that, withdrews, because from that space, right? I think one of the key things is, you know, with that shared space, it's got to, if it's going to work, it's got to be an adaptive model, so it's got to stay really nimble. And if you think about it as institutions, big institutions, and Iwi's the same. We're a subsidiary because we can move faster and break all the rules about hewie mothership because it's a big institutionalising force as well. So, you know, part of that adaptive model is thinking, is knowing when to commit, when to follow, when to lead, but also when to walk away. And we haven't reached that point yet, but we have those discussions. So, you know, I think with one partnership that's into its 3.0 model where the governance talk about its next evolution, because they say, well, if we stay at at where we are we're going to become business as usual that's not the expectation of our partners will plateau and that will be yeah it will start down that slope so again in a shared space you can kind of reinvent and reinvigorate one of the things we're talking about now is we've probably known everyone else every partner has a day job and so it kind of reinvent and reinvigorate. One of the things we're talking about now is we've probably known, everyone else, every partner has a day job. And so it kind of has to be sexy and high energy all the time, because we had one really successful initiative and has an event for events a year, and we're into version 22. And even the partners are like you know we're over it's not new it's not fresh so we constantly have to change skin and as I think that's a dynamic we're trying to kind of come to grips of an understanding well for it to work in terms of partnership the challenge is how do you sustain the high levels of energy because no one has paid more to commit to the partnership they all have a day job I would say though we have ejected partners out and largely that's when they're in the same sector and they can't get over their competitive bias so yeah the rest of the community is really sitting there and when I say community it might be industry It might be A social sector or community groups or family We don't have time for your crap, you know Yeah if you're going to fight over this funding. It's fine Remove yourself from this partnership because we're about achieving this ultimate outcome and you know if you're not making the waka go faster you know and so you do have those uncomfortable conversations every now on end we've only had to do that once you took about marginalisation you took a little bit about mind mobilisation and decriminalisationalisation within your process and now I heard you talking a little bit about the empowerment and the emancipatory ideas you know in rebalancing of that power and then I heard you talk a little bit about you know some examples of those things in theory, what's one practical thing that you're doing to rebalance that, taken from the marginalisation, decolonisation, back to a balanced model within the room? So, sorry, it's... So I think of that common agenda. So the community sets the agenda. So whether that be Fana, I mean, what we would normally do is we have a, we call it a strategic action framework and we bring in all of those community members. So industry, depending on what you're doing but I suppose the key thing is is that there would be a massive representation for Māori and community and so in terms of that strategic vision that's set and owned and privileged it privileges in terms of the shared measurement so the accountability of the initiative go back to the the ewee. So if you think of data measurement, data correlation, data analysis, that sits with the iwi. So straight away you kind of have accountability going back to the community. And if the community in a sense is framing, well what's important? What should we be looking for? What are we going to measure what will define our success even the simple thing of the funding to all the milestone reporting which is not something you really want to fight about but yeah having the dialogue with the funder and having a partnership with the fund is a way of increasing power for that community. Does that make sense? So in terms of that, the plan, so the plan sits with the hewee. So the hewee pulls everyone together, sits down, what are we going to be doing this year? We've got lots of goals, interventions around goal one, goal two, not much in in goal three what are we going to do so again you're trying to think about how you use structure and the sort of the mechanistic parts to shift the dynamics of power continuous communication facilitated through the hei so the hewe is the hub that brings everyone together so it's as you know it's held in a Māori space with Māori facilitators. You know, that everything is done in that way. And as I said, in our model, the backbone is in the way that needs to. And we have had that at times where the partners will go, you know, I own you. You know, I own you as well. I'm an equal shareholder and you know, I own you, I own you as well. I'm an equal shareholder, and you go, yep. But ultimately, we are really clear that our ultimate accountability sit with that community. And that if Iwi were to walk away, then we're dead, whereas if a tertiary partner walked away, that would be devastating, but, you know, we could survive. So those are just some examples. Thank you. overstating but you know we could survive so those are just some examples kapaita I'm the pleasure of working collaboratively with the technology professional development coordinators who stem from like they come off your backbone and they were working through something nationally to facilitate something which looked very much like that with Tahitanga for priority targets and it was it was really empowering for me to see that and I heard you acknowledge earlier that you that you went to primary high school and I was just wondering if you could reflect back into into the context you in education and find something that you might have found in this position you here. A tricky question. Actually, no. Simple question. I tell you what it was, and we're talking, Darren's just come back from Stanford from the design school, and that's a model, Stanford as an institution. It was only two weeks, but it was probably the most mighty experience of education I'd encountered outside of high school. And why I would say that, it was a cross-disciplinary model of education. So the design school and during, what we talked in as well, it's not focused around a discipline, it's focused around solutions. And it's kind of like a solution there, so you have multiple different disciplines. What impressed me is it's not like a commerce student is the best you know and the environmental or social sciences are you know it's nice but yeah they're not real real disciplines you know so you don't have that hierarchy and the underlying thinking of it is the problems that we're going to face are complex so you can't solve the challenges of the future with purely economic lens and environmental lens, the social science level. It's how all of those come together that we can create meaningful better solutions. So odd being in California that was kind of the more Māori experience. And as I said, coming back to that, why I would say is that Māori, it's because Iwi are the same, that their agenda, it's not to make money. It's to make money to support social change, cultural change in all of these areas. And so whenever you're dealing with those problems at an Iwi level, there's no simple solution. And in terms of the drivers for collaboration are pretty clear I think that while you can see it as we have lots of money the reality is even for maitahi if you looked at it in terms of population and in demographics it's around about five grand each and it will probably diminish with population growth so in order for us to have a meaningful impact to affect our purpose which is to address an equity then we've got to be tohunga experts at collaborating and supporting a shift and change and we've got to do that together. We can't do that by retreating and disengaging. So that's really where Iwi are coming from. Any time for one more? Going, going, going, going. Is this? It's on, um, greasy, so I can't stop you from downloading it. I can flip it for me. Oh, that's not. Yeah. And it's like it. And we can share. Yeah. There's plenty of good resources, like collaboration for impact. There's a great website. The Tamarik Institute. So there's lots of good resources and confidence are not much online. Well, thank you, Rudy. What an intelligent conversation that was about collective impact and collaboration. So thank you very much. There's lots to share there and I can tell just when I stood up and saw everybody totally engaged in the conversation and some great questions. So thank you everybody for participating this afternoon. Thanks once again. It would be much appreciated. Nore Laten-a-Ten-Ata-Tan-Tu."}
