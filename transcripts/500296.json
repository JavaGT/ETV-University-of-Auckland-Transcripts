You might remember that the Rugby World Cup is coming up and we've got some interesting things to do with that. I don't really know much about rugby but if you're into rugby you might be interested in this little gem here. This is a menu that has the signatures of the first ever team that was known as the All Blacks. It's pretty cool really. I bet it's worth a bit of money too. I don't personally know who these people are but you might if you're someone very knowledgeable about rugby. But one thing that is interesting to me is the tremendous moustaches on the players. Not all of them, but quite a few. You just don't see moustaches like that this day and age. And there's a nice little cartoon on the back. But pretty much this is kind of an amazing little thing. There's a list of all the teams they played and the score and who won and that's the kind of information you really want about a team from the olden days because you know people just say oh they were the best team they did that but you really want to know who they were against because it actually proved how good they were. This guy up here, David Gallagher, he was the captain of the team and he fought in the Boer War and in World War I where he actually died by being shot in the face. So I'm lucky for him but sounds like quite a cool guy and he actually had the best moustache out of all of them so that's probably why he was the captain. And this is the picture of the team that toured South Africa in 1949. And there was a bit of controversy about that team because there was no Maldi's allowed to play. So probably your teachers can explain to you more about that one. And next video we will be talking about the suffrage petition, which is pretty important really. I mean, without that, I probably wouldn't be talking to you right now. So yeah. Okay, so I'm going to keep digging through the archives, and if I find anything I think you guys will enjoy, I'll share it with you on here. And if you have anything interesting that you want to have a look at yourself, give us a shot and we'll see what we can do. Bye."}
