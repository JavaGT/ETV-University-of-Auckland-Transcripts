DHBs nationwide warn they're expecting a tough winter. With Jacinda Adirner, she prepares for the biggest meeting of her prime ministership with US President Joe Biden. And the Stokes family from New Zealand has pulled off a very special surprise for Ben, England's new cricket captain. Thank you, Good evening. Health staff are calling it one of the most challenging winters they've ever faced. And today, the Canterbury District Health Board has had to cancel surgeries because of a shortage of staff and beds. Official information obtained exclusively by News Hub reveals New Zealand's second biggest DHB has been worried about this for months. And now with influenza, COVID and staff shortages, they're in the eye of the perfect winter storm. Here's Juliet Speedy. Christchurch Hospital today, boosting at the seams. Capacity has blown out and sits at 112%. We need to be up front to say to you today that we are cancelling plan care today. Canceling planned care means cancelling some major surgeries with a 10% shortage in staffed beds. We don't take that decision lightly. We very much regret having to do that. But they had to. The DHB had hoped COVID would drop off by now, but it hasn't. And now there's a rapid rise of other serious winter illnesses. Previously, what we just had was COVID, which was challenging, but was manageable. But now we have COVID layered on top of influenza. And that influenza is making people really sick. News Hub spoke with one woman who currently has the flu, as does her toddler. They presented at ED yesterday because her son was extremely unwell and staff told her that young children are being hit especially hard because there has been zero flu in the community during the pandemic and therefore their immunity is nil. Like many, this woman said her unvaccinated experience with the flu has been far worse than her vaccinated experience with COVID. I absolutely have heard that from some anecdotal evidence that seems to have hit people harder than COVID has. All this while coping with a major staff shortage. The CDHB is up to 250 nurses short. On top of this, they've averaged 200 staff off every single day with COVID. We are in a very stretched position. The emergency department is also heaving significantly up on patient presentations with 30% of them needing hospital admission. But the problem is that 20% aren't sick enough to be there and should be going to their GP. Certainly there's a lot of pressure on the system right across the system at the moment. Official information documents released a News Hub show months ago the DHB forecast that an outbreak of winter illnesses would see a shortage of up to 120 resource beds every day. They were trying to avoid it and haven't been able to. Today's COVID numbers confirming they are again on the rise. Today there are 8,436 community cases, 389 are in hospital and nine of those are in ICU. 18 more people have died with the virus. The CDHB says this will be one of the most challenging winters they've faced. I definitely think we're going to see a challenge this winter like we haven't faced for webed. A serious problem for Canterbury and a preview of what DHBs around the country could be facing. Juliet joins us now from Christchurch Hospital and Juliet is this a nationwide problem? It is, Sam, and that's because the issues being faced by the DHB here are being faced by DHBs right around the country, that being staff shortages, sustained levels of COVID, and now the flu. And unfortunately, this problem could get worse. And that's because with the borders now open, more of these diseases that we haven't seen in the community are heading our way, and health authorities are particularly concerned about the measles. And that's because the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, although it is part of the childhood immunisation here in New Zealand, the numbers of it have dropped right off over the course of the pandemic. And health officials are urging people to check not only their own status of the immunisation against measles, but also that of their children. They are also saying that this year more than ever it is important to be immunised against both measles and the flu to not only help themselves, but also to help the immense pressure on our hospitals. Juliet, thank you for that update. Two senior leaders at Gloria Vale have stood down from their positions. The West Coast religious community says the resignations are part of its commitment to change. Faithful Pilgrim has resigned as a senior community leader. The former Gloria Vail's school principal was recently sanctioned by the Teachers' Council for endorsing a teacher he knew had indecently assaulted a nine-year-old girl. He also failed to notify police. Fervent Steadfast, one of Gloria Vail's most senior leaders or Shepherds, has also resigned. The Employment Court recently criticised him for failing to properly manage employment issues in the community. TVNZ will undertake an external review into its recruitment policies following the controversies surrounding breakfast host Kamal Santa Maria. Stuff reported the presenter's resignation followed a complaint by an employee about inappropriate behavior. It since prompted claims he was hired without due process. In a statement, TVNZ CEO Simon Power says it's his view their general policy hasn't been followed or applied consistently, so it needs to be reviewed, which will be conducted by senior employment lawyer Margaret Robbins. A Fijian journalist says she felt intimidated and threatened after being prevented from doing her job by Chinese security officials during the foreign minister's visit to Suva. It comes as reporters in Tonga where Wang Yi's just landed, say they too are getting little information. Pacific Affairs correspondent Michael Mora has the story. Wang Yi has spoken repeatedly about mutual respect, but that hasn't extended to reporters trying to cover his trip. Lise Monovo, who's been a journalist for 15 years, says she and her colleague were forcibly removed from a meeting room under the orders of the Chinese. We protested loudly and we were then removed and it was a very intimidating and threatening experience. She says another journalist colleague also had problems after trying to ask questions at the press conference. He was restrained until I stood between them and told them to let go. It's the right to know what's going on. And the removal of media and so on from covering and, you know, projecting those discussions to the public is obviously inappropriate. And in Tonga today, journalists were also tightly controlled. There's only a few medias that was advised and have approval to be here. With the details of what China hopes to achieve in the kingdom kept a secret. There was no press release from the Prime Minister's office or from the government. China secured multiple bilateral deals but getting region-wide cooperation on police training, trade fishing and cybersecurity issues outlined in China's leaked common vision plan has been rejected for now. Not all 10 Pacific nations targeted want to sign up. But there are some, of course, there are some concerns on some specific issues. China's foreign ministers said China's activity in the Pacific has been happening for years. Wang Yi says don't be too anxious and don't be too nervous. And Prime Minister Jacinda Ardenne referred to China's tour as a routine diplomatic engagement. What is happening right now is not new. Perhaps the pace has picked up and the engagement has picked up, but it is not new. But researchers think very differently. The tour from China's Foreign Minister is unprecedented. We have never seen this before in the Pacific Islands region and Australia and New Zealand and the United States are right to be concerned about it. China is moving at speed and it seems to be moving in a direction that perhaps is different to its traditional stance. Moving at speed and in the absence of any real countermoves from New Zealand. Gooder, Michael. So do we know which countries block the regional deal from going ahead? Yes, so we know that Sarmour's Prime Minister, Fair Mayor, Matta Afa, has indicated that everything was a bit too rushed and that more time was needed to consider the implications of such an extensive plan. And Nui also wanted more time. But it's important to point out, guys, that China has certainly not given up and says negotiations will continue to try and get regional agreement. The Foreign Minister of China is currently in Tonga, signing bilateral deals there, and next on the stop will be Vanuatu, so plenty more to come here. And I'm sure you'll be across it, Michael, thank you. On the eve of the biggest meeting of her prime ministership, Jacinda Ardern, says she will discuss the tensions in the Pacific with President Joe Biden. Political reporter Amelia Wade joins us now live from Washington, D.C. And Amelia, was this always the plan? Yeah, before Jacinda Ardenne took off for America, it was going to be her mission to talk about trade, climate change and Ukraine. But China's plays in the Pacific this week have skyrocketed it up her agenda. Banding together to march at the monument. A bit of a boogie and paying their respects Memorial Day at Washington, D.C. I came here to see my beautiful capital. I'd never been to the capital. For thanking those who gave their all, and that's important. It's just history. Well, history. And an historic day for New Zealand, at least, at the White House tomorrow. I don't know a whole lot about New Zealand, to be honest, right. I do know that we have our allies and partnerships. If your prime minister wants to meet the real president, they need to go to Margo in Florida and meet the true president of the United States. Donald J. Trump. But when Jacinda Ardern meets the actual president, it's China's role in the Pacific, which has now accelerated to the top of the agenda. Look, there'll be a number of issues on the agenda, as you can imagine, but really top of mind for us. Alongside, obviously, the war in Ukraine is the situation in our region. New Zealand wants America back in the Pacific as a counterweight to China's growing influence. What's really important is that all of our relationships in the Pacific need to be built in their own right, not because another country is present. This cannot all be about China. It cannot be all about China and yet so much of it is. But Ardun is determined to continue the tradition of not picking a side between the superpowers. Regardless of political party or the shade of government, New Zealand has been absolutely solid on maintaining our independent foreign policy. It is fair to say, though, that we align closely on many issues, obviously with those partners that share our values. And by that, Ard-Means New Zealand is better friends with the United States. And they're currently going through an infant formula crisis, 90% of its stock is gone and babies are in hospital. New Zealand obviously has the milk and this could form part of trade discussions. We look to overcome some of the trade barriers that our region faces in the United States. Also likely to come up, gun control. Americans less optimistic change is possible. America's founded on violence, no, sadly. Very difficult. I hope so. I would hope so. I'm absolutely open to sharing New Zealand's experience. And it's just that, though, it's New Zealand's experience. New Zealand at the White House sharing its experience for the first time in almost a decade. Well, Kiyora Amelia, and there's been even more drama today behind the scenes. Yes, far more drama in the saga that is this trip. Today we lost the Defence Force plane, leaving the delegation scrambling to book their own flights home. And we lost another to COVID an official who tested positive in the government-run PCRs. Besides, there is actually even room for more drama. Tomorrow we all have to pass rats to get into the White House so more could go down at the 11th hour. But none of this will matter to the Prime Minister, none of this chaos, because she has had COVID. She is getting through the door and getting into that meeting. There will be an exchange of a few pleasant trees before getting onto a highly choreographed routine where every word will matter. We look forward to hearing from that and good luck with the rat tests. Thanks Amelia. The government's cracking down on supermarkets to help bring down shopping bills, but there are calls for more drastic measures to break up the duopoly. As Lucy Warhurst reports, one commentator wants to see Woolworths and foodstuffs forced to sell more than a hundred of their retail stores to a competitor. There's no doubt a trip to the supermarket has got more expensive. Horrendous. A bit shocking. It is quite expensive. Food now. Fresh food. Same old story. The government could always do more. The government wants to bring down prices and it starts with wholesale. Our two main supermarket chains dominate the wholesale market and sell most of their product to their own stores. The government wants Woolworths, which owns Countdown and food staffs which owns Pack and Save, to open up their wholesale market to competitors at fair prices. If you've ever wondered why dairies are so expensive, that's the reason, because they're lining up to buy their stock at the supermarket as you do. But founder of online supermarket, Sufi, Sarah Ball, feels it will give foodstuffs and Woolworths too much control. We think that regulating wholesale supply will actually provide the duopoly with more power, more power than what they already have. The long-term solution will need real competition from a third or fourth challenger. New Zealand operators like Supi night and day or the warehouse could expand or there could be an overseas operator. We know that there is interest from other potential competitors. Aldi is one of those who are in the market in Australia. But they'll need to be a serious contender. You can't fix such a big strategic problem with one or two stores. You need 50, 100, 120 stores. Tex Edwards faced a similar situation 20 years ago when he founded two degrees, breaking up the telecom and Vodafone duopoly. It would end in tears unless there is like-for-like, scalable competition, where a challenger has at least 15 to 20% market share. But he says we don't need more supermarkets. Instead, the duopoly should be forced to sell over 100 of its retail stores to a third or fourth operator. A drastic move, but they're what we need to tackle the cost of living crisis. Lucy Warhurst, News Hub. Time now for a look at today's weather with Mike Puru, and it's been all over the place. It's like the weather doesn't know really what it wants to do today, Sam, chucking a little bit of everything at us. Dunedin takes out today's high with 23 degrees. The Carpid Coast area had the most rain, and Calvin the most wind. Now another low is hitting our way, meaning sadly more wind and rain warnings have been issued. I'll have all the details after sport. Thanks Mike and go to Neiden. 23, beautiful.

The defense in the trial of Fang Sun has told the jury, they might find it strange that he hired a private investigator to follow Elizabeth Zhang, but he did it to gather evidence for his legal proceedings against her over money. Feng Sun has pleaded not guilty to his former business partner's murder. And today his defence pointed at another man as a possible suspect. Alice Wilkins reports. Just days before Elizabeth Zhang was killed, a private investigator says Fung Sun sent him to Sky City Casino to take photos of her gambling. Today the defence told the jury of Sun was in fact the person who killed Zhang, that's not keeping a low profile. If you've formed this murderous intent, you've got this plan to kill at that stage, why on earth are you involving an ex-New Zealand police detective? Instead, the defence says Fung Sun employed private investigators to follow Elizabeth Chong because of his civil proceedings against her over money. The defence says he wanted to know her whereabouts so he could serve legal documents on her and collect evidence, and he was open and honest about it when questioned by police. You may not like the fact that Mr Sun was having Ms Zhang followed, and you might think it's a bit strange. But it made sense in as much as he had court proceedings happening, which he was still gathering evidence for. Fung Sun and Elizabeth Zhang went into business together in 2014, owning wineries and film companies. But the relationship soured, and in 2019 Sun filed legal proceedings against her in the High Court. He's not a complete idiot yet. He's fully aware that the whole world would be then looking to him as the very first person. If any arm happened, anything happened to Ms. John. In its closing statement today, the defence also pointed to Elizabeth Zhang's ex-boyfriend as a possible suspect, calling his behaviour when she was reported missing indifferent and cold, saying he didn't attempt to call or text her. You can't be sure if things done did it and you can't exclude Kai Guayjing as a reasonable possibility. Tomorrow, it will be up to the jury to decide. Alice Wilkins, News Hub. The European Union has agreed to an almost total ban on Russian oil imports after Ukraine's President Zelensky accused the West of going soft on sanctions. But it doesn't include Hungary, the Czech Republic or Slovakia, who were granted exemptions to safeguard their economies. It came as a French journalist was killed in Ukraine's east. Zelensky is saying it's the 32nd media fatality since the invasion. The wild herd of Kiamanoa horses have been given a contraceptive to help control numbers. The animals are mustered in the Central North Island almost every year. But as Alexa Cook reports, this new injection could change all that. Just three weeks ago, these horses were living wild in the Kamanawa range. But now they're being trained and domesticated. They're really cool little ponies. They're completely different to run-of-the-mill domestic horses. To protect the environment, the wild herd is capped at about 300. So almost every year since 1993, hundreds of horses are rounded up and rehomed. Hopefully they will be nice little kids' ponies. The uncertainty during the pandemic has meant people are more hesitant than ever to take on a kai Manawa. 150 homes were needed this year, but only 88 were found. Mustering to rehoming is unsustainable. It's very difficult to find qualified homes with the right facilities. Which is why a new equine contraceptive injection has just been approved. A project Sue Millard has been working on since 2009. It's a great to first step on the ladder and we're hoping that it'll prove to be immensely successful. 60 of the meers in this herd have been injected with the birth control that lasts four years. Reducing the breeding rate and the need to find homes for hundreds of wild horses. In eight years time, we would be looking at musters every two to four years. From a selfish point of view, I was like, oh bummer, we won't get to work with them as much. But actually, the horses come first. And not having as many numbers is going to be a good thing for them. And a good thing for the environment. Alexa Cook News Hub. Well, Nicky's in later with sport and a big family reunion. That's right.

Actor Johnny Depp has made surprise appearances on stage at two concerts in England, one of them at London's Royal Albert Hall.

Depp performed a number of songs with guitarist Jeff Beck. He's suing Hurd for nearly $80 million over claims she defamed him. She's counter-sewing him for $150 million. Preparations are underway for an epic celebration to mark the Queen's Jubilee in the UK. But back here, Republicans are preparing to use the occasion to push for New Zealand to split from the monarchy. Tom McCray reports. Royal fever has well and truly taken hold in the UK. This corgi cafe proof that you can't go far enough in celebrating 70 years of the Queen on the throne. I love the Jubilee. I love the Queen's got corgis. I thought it was only right to go with quite a regal name for him. Hence he's called George. From the Papachino Bar to a full buffet of doggy treats, the poochers are as pampered as her majesty. That's great. I feel proud to be British. But should we as Kiwis feel just as proud? The whole buffet of doggy treats, the poochers are as pampered as her majesty. It's great. Feel proud to be British. But should we as Kiwis feel just as proud? It represents what we once were, which was we were once a British colony. We're not a British colony anymore. That's a firm no, according to the head of our Republican movement. We are now an independent country, and we should act like it it and we should own all of our own institutions. But as royal enthusiast Angela Thompson proved last month at her Royal Garden Party, there is still very strong support for the monarchy in New Zealand. I'm very emotional and I'm very overwhelmed. As soon as I said that, it's incredible. The latest surveys show that more than half of Kiwis want to remain in the Commonwealth. And with the Queen's popularity at an all-time high, even the most die-hard Republicans admit it's an uphill battle to change minds. There's a lot of people who like the Queen, but they don't necessarily like the monarchy. Across Britain, the stage is being set for four days of celebrations, from pop concerts to street parties and parades, where a 42 strong Kiwi military contingent will march. But for how long will New Zealand remain in step with Britain after the Queen's reign ends? Tom McCray, News Hub. The family who own Faccari White Island is seeking to have charges against them dismissed following the fatal eruption in 2019. In a case review hearing today at the Faktane District Court, the lawyer representing the Bottle family said they were proceeding with the application. It comes after the National Emergency Management Agency, one of the 13 parties' work-safe charge with failing in their duty of care on the island had its charges dismissed. A hearing on the case has been scheduled for October in the Auckland District Court. The mother of the three missing Maricopa children has released a statement via police saying she's beside herself with worry and pleading to the public to come forward with any new information. Janet Maverick and Ember's mother says growing and active kids need food, clothes, bedding and health care. Like police, she believes someone must be assisting their father, Tom Phillips, who went on the run for a second time with the children almost six months ago. Police put a plane up at the weekend over the remote King Country region. They say they're following up several lines of inquiry.

As an unsuspecting Ben Stokes finished up at training, his brother James tracked the team bus from his hiding place. They're just around the corner. And Mum Debra continued to pace. Just around the corner. They're just around the corner. For weeks, she has been keeping the secret that she wasn't travelling from Christchurch alone. I just really wanted to give Ben another lift. Because it's been a tough few years for the Kiwi-born cricketer. Cleared of a fray in a trial in 2018, his dad, Jed Stokes, died in late 2020. And months later, the 30-year-old took indefinite leave from the game to focus on his mental health. This week, he's back at Lords as captain. I was just really proud, eh? I know the old man, he looked him down, proud his punch. Dad did, he'll ever been like, took him everywhere. And now he's here. The last time the family was together, Jed was still alive. Ben watched the funeral on a live stream from England. So this reunion, this hug, is long overdue and there was only one person who was about to tear mum and son apart. The profanities and tears flowing in equal measure. That hug's been a long time coming. It has, yeah, that has no doubt about it. A big start to a very big week for the all-rounder. Going out and being come to the first time, it's amazing to have family around and stuff like that. It's obviously a very special moment, so, yeah, it's awesome. The skipper's spirits were already high after a successful first training with Brenda McCullimer's coach. I feel like what this test side needs is just a bit of Brendan McCullum. Another reason for New Zealand to claim that England wins if they ever happen. It will be all right, we'll be. It'll be happy families for the Stokes family. Either way. In London, LeSitt Raymer News Hub. That's a touching story. Meanwhile, Blackcaps coach Gary Stead is downplaying the media hype around the impact of England's dynamic duo of Stokes and McCullum. While much is anticipated from McCullum in his first test as England coach, Stead is not expecting to see any radical change in the way England play at Lords. He'll have a clear vision of how he wants them to play the game. I mean, whether that happens instantly or not. I guess it always takes a little bit of time to embed those things. So I'm not sure as impact right now will be as much as what you might see in a year's time. With Henry Nichols still recovering from injury, all-rounder Michael Bracewell will act as 16th man, while Trent Bolt is an unlikely starter after a late arrival from the IPL final. Blue star Roger Tuwivas Scheck is brushing aside any talk of being included in the All Blacks, for now at least. The former Warriors captain says he's more focused on bringing a title to his hometown. Alex Chapman caught up with him. Roger Tuwifasa Shik's lacing up for the biggest week in his rugby union career. Very exciting for myself back at finals footy. That's because, and sorry Warriors fans, his postseason appearances had been few and far between in recent years. But that changes this week against the Highlanders. Being an Auckland boy, I get to play a finals here in Eden Park here in Auckland, so I'm real pumped up for that. Such is his determination to bring a title to his hometown, the talk of a black jersey, is still far from his mind. I'm here in my first time back in Rugby Union. I'm trying to learn my role as a 12. We've got finals footy this week. So it's been quite easy just to have my head in the moment and hearing the blues H-Cube. That's despite his gameplay catching the eye of even the All Blacks coach. What are those conversations been like? Yeah, this was more real early, just it was more after my first game. I think he was just giving me some encouragement and he sort of called me when I got injured and just saying stay on top of the rehab and enjoy the time off, and that was about it. He's doing a great job in the Blues, and we've had some connections with him, and I know he's in a great spot, so we're just got to look at his progress, and particularly the next four or five weeks will be critical on that. And critical in the Blues Hunt to continue their winning run. Alex Chapman, Hussab. To netball now, and the Central Pulse are now top of the ANZ Premiership after beating the tactics 51-43 in Christchurch last night. The win means whichever team comes out on top when they play the COVID-depleted mystics on Friday night will go straight through to host the grand final. Luke Robinson has more. The Central Pulse left Christchurch today with a sense of satisfaction. It's great to come and get a win and whatever it looks like. Unfortunately, it was a bit of an ugly win. It may have been ugly, but it was vitally important. A full-time heater, it smiles on, Yvette, McCallum, Jury's face. The 51-43 win elevating the pulse to the top of the ANZ Premiership ladder. Just one game at a time, we've still got one game to go. And with one game to go, it's simple. Another win secures a home final. We've got the ability to control our own outcome at this point, and that's a really good space to be in. Their final game is against the previous competition leaders, the Mystics, who could be without four players due to COVID, and also star shooter Grace Noeke, who is sidelined with an ankle injury. Yeah, it's our middle, it's our mid-court that are going to suffer in terms of not having our whole mid-court available. The only thing we can assume is that with the return to play, that they'll run a number of players, They'll probably have a few new players. Despite that, the Pulse are expecting a sharp mystic side. I've been the leaders throughout this competition in 2022, so they'll come back really strong. In the face of adversity, sometimes you prevail and you play a lot better. The Mystics, on the other hand, bullish about their chances of beating the Pulse. I watched Pulse really closely last night. They're still making errors in their game, like all players are as they get back on court. The Pulse, hoping to not miss a beat as they are a home final. Luke Robinson News Hub. World number two, Denele Medvedev and fourth seed Stefano's Sitzapas have both been bundled out of the French Open. Sitsapas was outclassed by teenager Holgerun, who dropped only one set to become the first Danish man to reach the quarterfinals. Medvedev was then sent packing, losing in straight sets to former US Open champion, Mar and Chillich. Absolutely fantastic match from the first point until the last. I enjoyed the atmosphere, enjoyed night sessions here, played incredible tennis, one of the best matches of my career from start to finish, and yeah, just enjoy it to be here. World number one, Ego Jvontek recovered from a set down to defeat Xin Wjong to reach the quarterfinals. And I can tell you that, Shvontec, now has 32 wins in a row.

An entire Air Force full of drones has done a top gun over Sydney as part of the Vivid Light Show Festival. The city's spectacular event is back after two years in a dark place called COVID. Channel 7's Tom Hartley reports. Wave after wave, a futuristic fleet rises over Sydney Harbour in perfect formation. And so began the biggest drone show seen in the southern hemisphere, 600 of them dazzling all who laid eyes on the sky. They formed spaceships familiar to adults, cartoons familiar to kids. The music was so loud you couldn't hear them buzzing. Or see the half dozen that toppled into the harbour. After that bumper opening weekend in a two-year COVID hiatus, this is shaping up to be the busiest Vivid Festival on record. But there is something that could get in the way of that. And of course, it's the weather. All this wind, all this rain. Already they're starting to bring some of the displays down, including these big shiny balls. Safety first from wherever you view vivid. Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa has been attacked by a man wielding a cream cake. The attacker was disguised as a woman and in a wheelchair which allowed him to get close enough to smear the bulletproof glass cover that protects the painting itself. It was shouting slogans about saving the planet and was taken away from psychiatric assessment. The attack did not damage the painting or wipe the smile of its face. A University of Auckland scientist has confirmed the existence of a rare Manta Rain nursery in Indonesia. After leading an eight-year study scientist Eddie Sichuan has discovered more about the graceful and giant creature than ever before. His team used drones to monitor the nursery in a lagoon and have managed to compile the most robust assessment of mantarays to date. Sichuan says the research is relevant to New Zealand, as many believe we host a nursery for globally endangered giant mantarays in our waters. Our top stories tonight.

Coming out, NewsHubweather, and Mike, it looks like you've had your highlighter out. Quite a lot of yellow on that map. Actually, I think it's the most coloured in the wind watches I've ever seen.

Kiyah, good evening, tie down the trampoline and hold on to your hats. It is said to get wet and windy again. Now, this menacing, low-pressure system drags another front onto the country tonight, bringing a strong westerly flow. And with that comes strong winds, rain, thunderstorms and some big seas. So there's a lot to be aware of. For the South Island first up, the west coast and northern parts of the island you get rain, some of it heavy with thunder and scattered showers for everyone else. Now tomorrow those showers again could be pretty full on at times, but for everyone else it's mainly fine those showers, again, could be pretty full-on at times, but for everyone else it's mainly fine, but there will be some strong or gale northerlies. Sand into the North Island. Thundery rain returns tonight, but it does pass quickly with some strong northerly winds. Wednesday, it's a mixture of fine weather and scattered showers, but Northland, Auckland, Tadernaki, through to Hawks Bay and Wellington, all under a strong wind watch. So let's break that down a little more. Fine spells and a shower old too expected for northern areas. Fithianga gets rain before dawn with some heavy falls. They will be thundery at times to strong north-westerlies should ease in the morning. Further south and those strong winds come to visit for breakfast but then they leave without doing the dishes. Now some showers get a little heavy with thunder and more frequent for Rotorua and Taupo. Let's head east now. Now, there's some morning rain, but then it finds up for Gisbon, Napier and Hastings, but a few showers in gusty norwesterlies will slide into Danny Verk and Master Tim. And for the rest of the North Island, it's not pretty at all, really, unless you like rain, hail, Gale, Gailforce winds and showers all mixed in to a 24-hour period. Okay, let's go over the straight. Heavy rain turns to showers in the morning and everyone here expecting hail after midday. With Westport and Nelson, you'll get some strong northerly's highs here between 14 and 17 degrees. Okay, let's keep the window wipers on high and head across State Highway 73. Rain turns to showers for Blenham, who along with Christchurch will get some strong winds. Everyone else, you should have a cloudy day. And for southern parts of the country, Queensland and Oamaru are in for some heavy showers, but for everyone else, it's a mainly cloudy day with highs between 14 and 17. Okay, time for a look at the metros coming to Eden. Cloudy periods for you with some rain before dawn, along with some northerly, 16, 17 degrees. you're expected higher tomorrow. And for Ootahe, morning rain, but it does clear along with some strong northerlies, especially in exposed places. Kiyoda Wellington, well, a few symbols here that you probably don't want to see. You're in for showers, some of them heavy with strong northerlies, reaching gale force and exposed areas. Not that flash at all. And further north in Hawks Bay, not too bad for you. The winds get a little gusty around the ranges, but things do find out with a high of 22 degrees. Those thundery showers could be hanging around in the morning, but it finds up strong northerly's ease, and you should reach a high of 20, 21 degrees, for the Tohanga area. Inland now to the Waikato and overnight rain turns to showers while the time you head to school or work with northerlies and a high of nine-team. Hello Auckland. It's a case of fine spells, isolated showers with some strong winds blowing all those autumn leaves around in the morning. Okay, time to stick our heads over the fence and have an ozy at the neighbours. Australia continues to be cold with a polar blast and strong winds that knocked out power in Sydney last night and also bought snow around the ranges in Melbourne. It's going to be the same tomorrow. And in the Pacific, looking pretty good with plenty of sunshine, Fiji gets to an impressive 32 degrees. Back here now and a few more showers in the north, with wind and rain starting to ease towards the end of the week. A mixture of fine periods and showers for these areas, but wind and rain starting to ease towards the end of the week. A mixture of fine periods and showers for these areas, but you can see the temperature's change as some cold air moves in towards the weekend. Still a few thunderstorms around for Taranaki on Thursday, but it finds up for Queen's birthday weekend, and those thunderstorms possible for Nelson and Blenham Thursday, but a return to cold nights and frosty conditions for nearly everyone in the South Island by Saturday. So it's a little messy tonight with all that wind and rain, but a return to cold nights and frosty conditions for nearly everyone in the South Island by Saturday. So it's a little messy tonight with all that wind and rain, but better to get it out of the way before the long weekend. I'd like your thinking. Thank you, Mike.
