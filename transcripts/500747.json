Jacinda Ardern unveiled a working holiday scheme in Singapore. Calls for a national inquiry into safety after another person dies at Auckland's port, the fourth fatality in five years. Emotional workers pay tributes to a colleague at the waterfront facility. And the big battle begins. Russia's major assault on eastern Ukraine is underway as heavy-duty bombs hit the steel plant in Mariu-Pol, where a group of fighters are holding out why it's so hard for Russia to subdue them. No-may-hi- my, welcome to One News. The Prime Minister's first overseas trip since a pandemic began two years ago has been hit by COVID, with three members of the trade delegation testing positive. But Jacinda Adirns tested negative in Singapore, which meant she could continue top-level talks with the country's political and business leaders. She announced an expanding working holiday scheme, allowing more young Singaporeans to visit New Zealand and for longer. One News political editor, Jessica Much Mackay, is travelling with the Prime Minister. She'll join us live shortly. First, here's how the trade missions played out so far. If you'd forgotten what a lavish state welcome looks like, here's a reminder. After two years inside Fortress, New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern is getting back into face-to-face diplomacy. We'll mask to mask at least. It's not without risk, but it is time now for New Zealand to be reaching out again, inviting people within this new normal to come and visit New Zealand because we are open for business. An orchid naming ceremony for New Zealand. This is the Jacinda Ardern variant. There was time for a quick catch-up with Singapore's first female president, Halema Yaakov. But the nitty-gritty was down to Singapore's Prime Minister. The New Zealand media were allowed to ask two questions. What is your country prepared to compromise on to get the US to rejoin the CPTPP? And how important is its participation? We would dearly love to see them come back but they have told us quite clearly. It's nothing to do with us. It's just off the table because their politics does not make it possible. It's our job to make sure that we're continuing to engage and offering up those opportunities where the United States can demonstrate an engagement in the economic architecture, and the economic well-being of this region. New Zealand and Singapore are united in trying to get the US back into the multilateral trade deal America pulled out of in 2017. It's hoped there will be power in numbers. We all see the benefits that the CPTPP has offered us as nations. It sets a very high standard for trade and that's the kind of standard that we'll of course continue to be promoting that those who wish to join should be looking to that agreement as a good first port of call. More Kiwis could be enjoying the sites of Singapore with the announcement a working holiday programme as being extended for both young Kiwis and Singaporeans. Another 100 added to the quota, who can now stay for a year. In those recent years, we did see good demand, and so it made sense for us to increase and meet that demand. China's friendship with Russia it made sense for us to increase and meet that demand. China's friendship with Russia makes it tricky for countries like Singapore and New Zealand when it comes to the war in Ukraine. We continue to encourage at every level China to continue to acknowledge what the Ukraine conflict represents for the world. It's been a long time between meals. It is a a long time between meals. It is a pleasure to be back here in the same space that I was very privileged to visit what was about three years ago, but approximately a lifetime in pandemic years. So there's a bit of catching up to do. Okay, Jess is with us live from Singapore. Kiaura Jess, what part is COVID playing in the trip so far? Well, a pretty big part of today. There are 50 New Zealanders on this trip, and that's the Prime Minister and her officials, as well as a media delegation, the New Zealand Defence Force delegation who got us over here, as well as a business group too. And of that group, there's of that 50, three people tested positive on our PCR arrival tests here in Singapore. Now, I understand that all of those people had had COVID-19 before, but it was still showing up in those tests. And because of the strict rules that Japan has, they will no longer be able to travel onto Japan, those three. Their trip will end here in Singapore. Now, this trip is a big deal. It's a first for us because it's our first overseas trip post-COVID, but it's also a first for Singapore as well. It's the first time they've welcomed a world leader post-COVID as well. And you can definitely feel the pressure and the energy here today. Perhaps people aren't feeling quite as match fit with that muscle memory of traveling as they were before. And you did feel like there were quite a few people perhaps out of practice and not quite so used to travelling as we have been in the past. But the Prime Minister will be ticking off today so far as a bit of a success here in Singapore. And I'm sure that won't dull the enthusiasm, Jess. So what's next on the itinerary? Well, at the moment, we're just outside Astana, which is the White House of Singapore. The Joint Media Conference with Prime Minister Lee wrapped up about 40 minutes ago, and the Prime Minister is still inside. She'll be leaving shortly. But the day's not over for her. She's got a gala dinner tonight where there will be lots of opportunities to talk with business leaders for the New Zealand side and for the Singapore side and that will be a pretty grand event. Tomorrow was all about business here in Singapore too and then tomorrow evening New Zealand time we head off to Tokyo. So we'll keep you updated as things unfold here from a very warm and humid Singapore. I have to say it looks quite lovely. Emihana Kiakue, Jessica Machin, Singapore, thank you very much. And as just mentioned, she will have updates including photos and video from the PM's trip. You just need to go to our website, OneNews.co.N.Z, and on our late news tonight, that's at 10.30. Another death at Auckland's port has prompted a call for a wider inquiry into safety issues in the industry. It's the fourth death at the port since 2017. The facility's been under huge pressure in recent years to clear a shipping backlog. Logan Church reports. Tragedy striking again at the ports of Auckland. Police called about 920 this morning, ambulances and fire trucks racing to the scene, but too late. Authorities confirming the worker fell from a height and died, their colleagues left stunned. People are just starting to realise that one of their workers, their working mates, has passed away. A spokesperson for Wallace Investments, the company that's employed the worker, says they are deeply saddened by what's happened and a full investigation is underway. This death just the latest at the port. To tell you the truth, I was absolutely devastated to hear that hit another death has happened at the ports this morning. Amor Kalati was crushed by a container in 2020. So I seriously think that, you know, they need to look into this and they need to make some drastic changes. In 2017, swimmer Leslie Gelberg was fatally struck by a ports of Auckland pilot boat. A year later, crane operator Labrumb Dyer, was killed after his crane tipped over. A review released early last year found the Ponds had a culture of prioritising productivity over safety, and there were systemic health and safety problems. The boss quit, but the fatalities have continued. Surprised has happened after the focus in the recent years, but sort of not surprised. It's the industry that's been under a lot of stress with the supply chain constraints, and it's the drive to, you know, move cargo and get off the port, get off the ship as quick as they can. He wants a wide-ranging review into the industry. I think we need a real, a robust inquiry into the stewardoring, or port industry as a whole. Fears this death won't be the industry. I think we need a real robust inquiry into the stewardoring or port industry as a whole. Fares this death won't be the last. Logan Church, One News. A question in Eden late last night has brought the final Easter holiday road toll to four. It comes after accidents in Queensland, South Canterbury and Auckland over the weekend. While the final road toll is lower than the nine deaths recorded at Easter in 2021, it's still higher than many other years. A pivotal stage of the Ukraine war is underway after Russia unleashed its most intense aerial barrage in weeks. Ukraine says Russian forces have launched ground assaults along a 400 km front in the east, stretching from the northern Kharkiv region to the besieged port of Maripal in the south. Russia's likely aim to capture the entire Donbass area. It's expected to be a brutal battle. Russia's been flooding the east with reinforcements and weapons for weeks and Ukraine's been gearing up and digging in too, with some of its best and most experienced fighters in the region. Ukraine's president vowing to fight, whatever the odds, as Jordan Rudd reports. An explosive curtain razor to Russia's new assault in the east. Leviv's sense of relative safety in the West shattered by Russian missiles, killing seven civilians. An industrial unit was hit near the city centre, firefighters struggling to get trapped workers out. This couple lost their only son. It has not been done by humans. Humans cannot do such things. They are not humans. They are barbaric invaders. Until now, Leviv has been a safe haven for the elderly, women and children fleeing the fighting elsewhere. Over night, it was just one of the many cities and centres Russia bombarded to grind down Ukraine's defences. And now, the battle for Donbass begins, Russia launching its long-fired all-out offensive. The industrial heartland is Russia's new primary goal after failing to take the capital, Kiev. But there's no guarantee it'll do any better in the east, as it takes on Ukraine's toughest and best, hell-bent on defending their land. Even if they just walk in one or one- a half metres, there won't be questions. They will get what they deserve. No matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves and we will do it every day. We won't give up anything Ukrainian. America's boosting that defense. The last of its promised high-powered weapons shipments will get to the east soon, despite Russia's warning of unpredictable consequences if the U.S. didn't stop. There were four planes that arrived at military assistance over the course of the weekend. Another one is supposed to arrive today if it hasn't already. But the capture of foreign forces has given Russia some leverage over the West. These British soldiers captured in Maripol put on Russian state TV begging their government to help. If Boris Johnson really does care like he says he does about British citizens and he would help pressure Selensky to do the right thing and return Victor to his family and return us to our families. This is the fight they've left behind Maripol's steelworks-turned-fortress that's become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Local forces releasing this footage keen to show they're not hiding in the complex, but counter-attacking where they can. Jordan Rudd, 1 News. Well, they're outnumbered and out-gunned, but Maru Poles resistance continues to defy the Russians. In their favour, the Azov-style steel plant, to the east of the city, right there by the port, where they're holed up and making their last stand. It's massive 11 square kilometres. That's roughly three times the size of Auckland's CBD. Getting in closer, this satellite image showing the vast, sprawling complex with numerous buildings, furnaces, and even train tracks, notice the smoke rising from the Russian bombardment. Let's show you a view closer to the ground now to explain why Russia's finding it so difficult to subdue these last pockets of resistance. It's all about what lies beneath what we're seeing here. Experts say it's a fortress in a city, basically a whole city under the city, an enormous subterranean network of tunnels which can't be destroyed from the air. There are so many nooks and crannies to hide in in the complex underground system that it's highly dangerous for Russian troops to go in. It's estimated two and a half thousand a thousand civilians. The latest report say Russia's starting dropping bunker bombs on the plant where those under siege say there'll be no surrender. Back to the battle for Donbass and Russian forces have taken at least one Ukrainian city already according to reports. Many civilians have evacuated but some are staying put despite the expected onslaught. The BBC's Jonathan Beale sent this from eastern Ukraine as Russia's new offensive began. This is now the sight and sound of the Dombas. Severodernetsk, another city and another target for Russia's unrelenting bombardment. We tried to enter to speak to families taking shelter, but the thump of artillery was steadily coming closer. We just came here to go to a shelter, but there's shilling a bit close to us, and so we had to move out. This was once a popular tourist destination. Now it's just another town from which people flee. What can I say? I'm overwhelmed with grief. I'm 70 years old, and I've nowhere to live. The few who've stayed behind have to queue for food. They're not just hungry, though. They're scared. I cry every day. What kind of God would allow this to happen? There is now a strong military presence in this town. Just a few miles down the road, Russian forces are advancing from the north. A Ukrainian soldier shared this drone footage of how they were trying to slow down the Russian columns, blowing up a bridge. But they know more will be coming. We know that Russian forces are bringing reinforcements into this region, but we're doing everything possible. We are ready to repel the Russian occupiers and prevent the capture of our cities. We will stand to the last and defend our homeland. Nowhere here is safe within range of Russian artillery. And as we've seen, Russia is pushing forward from the north, from the east and from the south. And there's a real danger that Ukraine's forces here could be surrounded. For now, they're holding out. So too are the remaining citizens of Avdivka, hiding in bunkers. But for how long? And in the coming hours, the US presidents will call Western allies to discuss how to get Ukraine even more military support. Well, it's a voyage, two years in the making. Oh, we're just so excited. Oh, yes, Australia says gai to cruise ships once again, so will our cruising industry be throwing the same lifeline? Recovery efforts continue in South Africa following deadly flash flooding.

No, my Arnold. Welcome back. There have been jubilant scenes across the ditch as the first cruise liner since the pandemic was welcomed into Sydney. But the industry here will have to wait several more months before it can join the party. And operators say the delay could end up costing the economy hundreds of millions of dollars. Sam Calway explains. Australia turning it on. With the biggest of gays for the Pacific Explorer as it steamed into Sydney. Just can't contain the excitement. We just want to cheers everything and we're just so excited. I am fairly certain that there will be very few dry eyes. But there's no celebrations here. With no ships on the horizon, Littleton's $67 million cruise ship terminals effectively mothballed as our maritime border remains sealed off. It's a real problem for us because unless an announcement comes out formally from government, then we'll see more cruise ships cancelled. It's been two years since the last cruise visited here. The industry was making more than half a billion dollars each year. Nearly 200 port calls have been scumpered already this season with the closed borders. The issues are our international tourism sector in New Zealand will have to be rebuilt because so many people have moved elsewhere. A lot of work needs to be done, not just by the cruise lines, but by everybody who depends on crews throughout New Zealand. He says that could take years. Meanwhile, New Zealanders like Alan Mead are having to fly to Australia to get their cruise fix. It's such a shame that this has happened that Kiwis are having to fly all the way to Brisbane or Sydney to get on a cruise ship to have a holiday which they really enjoy. He says others have had multiple trips cancelled and it's time to open up. or Sydney to get on a cruise ship to have a holiday which they really enjoy. He says others have had multiple trips cancelled and it's time to open up. As we've indicated more generally, we're looking to try and bring forward decisions around the border as we've done with the air border. So I'd expect an announcement around that within the next couple of weeks. But with almost all other cruise destinations back up and running, New Zealand could end up the last port of call. Sam Callaway, one news. 10,000 soldiers have now been deployed in South Africa after devastating flooding swept through the country's east last week. More than 440 people have died and dozens more are still missing. Officials say the floods are some of the worst to ever hit Kualu Natal province, which is where the BBC's Vamani Makizi sent this report from. At the Kwasanthi Township, south of Durban, this community is still trying to come to terms with the flash floods that devastated this area. This search and rescue team is on a recovery operation. They are looking for a woman swept away by the flash floods at night while she was asleep. Behind me, this is where the water was cascading down this hill. And unfortunately, a man and a woman were swept away by the raging waters. The man was found alive. Unfortunately, the woman is still missing. And we've got community members here searching with their bare hands looking for her. And also further downstream, we've got search and rescue operation with dogs also looking for the woman. On the night of the floods, some even risk their lives to save others. I found a man trapped by a tree, so I managed to pull him out of the water. I put him inside the house. I had more people crying and ran to help another woman. She's still in hospital, but alive. The other man died. All over the Guazulu Natal province, stories of flesh floods and local heroes who did their best to save lives are emerging. The death toll has risen to nearly 450. 63 people are still missing. Local authorities are rallying the public to rebuild. This is the moment of great adversity, but this is also a moment where we need to summon our collective courage and turn this devastation into an opportunity to rebuild our province. It is a moment for the human spirit to triumph over adversity. More surge and rescue teams from around the country have been dispatched to Guadalu Netsal as recovery operations continue. And South Africa's president is vowing to spare no expense in rebuilding infrastructure and assisting those affected. Kirti Tornu Mai. Stay with us.

All new Lego Masters, New Zealand, coming soon on two. Kiara, Arno, cardiologists rather, and GP, say they're noticing a rise in concern about vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis. Three people have died from myocarditis after getting the COVID vaccine in New Zealand. It's a rare side effect that's much more likely to be caused by COVID infection. Kristen Hall reports. Getting the ticker checked out after a scary experience. I was highly stressed. I was scared. I didn't know what was going on. At that one point, my heart rate was through the root. 23-year-old Sebastian Eads developed pericarditis while infected with COVID-19, which he's still recovering from now. I found that I can't consume any energy drinks or anything that accelerates my heart rate because of my chest I was sight hurting. At the moment, we'd get a phone call a day, at least, or patient a day that we'd see where they've got COVID and the body's been turned on to attack their heart. Myocarditis and pericarditis, which inflamed the heart and the membrane around it, can also be caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. It's much less common, but doctors are noticing a rise in patients who believe they are affected. Towards the end of last year, the start of this year, when there was a heightened awareness of mycarditis and pericarditis as a potential follow-on from the vaccination, and certainly this year it has picked up. Most of the time they have the symptoms, but they have no objective evidence of heart involvement. It's pretty routine that these patients will get a blood test. Sometimes they get an ECG, and by far and away the majority, both of these tests are normal. So far more than 4 million Kiwis have had at least one vaccination dose. There have been 783 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis reported to medsafe. But the Ministry of Health says not all of those reports are medically confirmed. If you have symptoms like that, you should get them checked out by a doctor. And in the majority of cases, it won't be serious. For those on the fence about getting boosted, the risk of myocarditis with the booster is extremely rare, extremely rare. We're talking in the highest risk group about 1 in 10,000, but for the vast majority of people, you're looking at around 1 in 100,000 chance. Vaccination is still the safest means of protection as COVID continues to spread. Kristen Hall, 1 News. Prince Harry has acknowledged the courage shown by the Ukrainian team competing at this year's Invictus Games. The 19 competitors were given special permission by the president to take part in the sporting event for injured servicemen, women and veterans. Here's a BBC's Anna Hologan. Each competitor bears the scars of conflict. For many who thought they wouldn't make it, sport has provided a lifeline. In an interview with the BBC, Prince Harry highlighted how far the Ukrainians had come. A vast majority of the Ukraine team were serving in some shape or form. So they removed their uniforms, put their team strips on, jumped on the coach, came over here, slept for a couple of days, tried to decompress, and then were straight into it. And then they've got to go back. So I think to have them here is extraordinary. Their presence has added poignancy. Many will be returning to the battlefield. We don't have another choice. It's simply the question of survival, of our nation and our people. All of us must fight. Our government decided that we should be here despite the difficult situation and talk to the world, show that we are getting killed, but we are fighting and staying alive. Dmitro's attitude embodies the spirit of these games. But there's a focus here too on repairing lives. Invictus athletes are encouraged to bring the people who've been part of their journey to recovery. There's a real family vibe here inside the Invictus Park. These games are partly designed to recognise and celebrate the vital role that families play as support structures helping wounded soldiers to rebuild their lives. And this is a mission the Prince wants to extend even further, taking Invictus into new territories. We're constantly inviting new nations because this is about healing, right? And as the bigger teams, US, UK, perhaps decrease in number, it's going to provide an opportunity for more nations to come in who desperately need this opportunity in this place to heal together. And Prince Harry founded the Games now in their fifth year to aid the rehabilitation of injured and sick military personnel around the world. Marvel fans have been given a sneak peek of the next installment in the famous Thor movies. These hands who I once used for battle. Now they're but humble tools for peace.

Kioriti, we welcome to one sport. A title drought broken and a warning shot fired ahead of the Commonwealth Games. Kiwi Squash star Joel King has won the Manchester Open this morning, convincingly beating one of her main rivals for a game's medal in the final. In doing so, the 2018 champions given herself a much-needed confidence boost at the perfect time. Chris Chang reports. If the three-love victory over the number one seed was straightforward... That's given, Joel King, the second Manchester-rope-time title. Joelle King's road back to title-winning form has been anything but... I'm actually quite emotional because it's... Sorry. It's been a long time since I've won an event. Three years of struggles near misses all while away from family in New Zealand. Now... Yeah. Pretty cool. I'm so happy. And Joel King! It's the first tournament I've actually won since this event in 2019. And, you know, it's a pretty special one. I've been through some pretty rough patches with my squash. When you hit over 30, you start to have a few questions about, you know, physically, am I still good enough? You know, is there still more improvement I can make? The Bristol-based 33-year-old answered those doubts against friend and rival Sarah Jane Perry, who's likely to be her main competitor at the Commonwealth Games. Obviously going into Com Games, winning in three against someone like SJ, mentally is a good thing. And it only took 41 minutes on court, probably just as well after her exhausting semi-final. My body has been in bits and people have been putting me back together. So I'm just, yeah, I'm emotional because it means so much. That's what makes this even sweeter is, you know, proving people wrong that I still have good squash left of me. I'm still physically able to be there and it just makes it really sweet. A physically taxing tournament, but one which has crucially boosted King's belief that she still belongs with the world's best. Chris Chang, One News. It was another busy weekend for the Super Rugby Judiciary, two red cards and an upheld sighting, meaning 10 weeks' worth of suspensions across three Kiwi teams. Not the ideal way to kickstart the Trans-Tasman component of Super Rugby Pacific. Dewey Press has more. A rugby weekend that delivered so many highs. Can he get it down? Yes! But a wash-up that's once again highlighting the lows. The not-so-new tackle guidelines still catching players off-guard. It's a pretty fluid game and sometimes the boys get it wrong. And we fully understand why we have to be better because we can't have guys get hit in the head. Super's probably a little bit soft on the red cards and you slow-mo every tackle down at all. They all look like head knocks. So you've got to just got to hit them here, let them run into your hair or try to get under them. So you're just got to find that balance of your tackle choices. Teammate Josh Dixon made the wrong choice on Sunday. To direct shoulders to the head with a high level of danger. It's a lead card. But while he and Scott Barrett's shoulders both drew the attention of the TMO, it's the one that didn't which irked the Highlanders. We've cleared it. there's no foul play. Except there was. If you're going to pick up one, you've sort of got to get them all right, I think. It's such a big impact on the, I guess, the entertainment and ultimately results. While Omuah's actions avoided on-field sanctions, he couldn't escape the judiciary. All three players initially given six weeks suspensions. Omua and Dixon had theirs halved for a clean record, while Barrett's priors copped him an extra week. Players and coaches constantly working on their tackling techniques. It is very difficult because obviously we want to bring a lot of physicality, and so balancing that with making sure we don't hit someone in the head, because we're not out there trying to hit someone in the head on purpose, you know. If you don't quite get it right, people can get hurt. And so I don't think it's gone soft. I just think we're trying to make it as safe as possible, but it's still a context board. That much will be evident when the canes kick off this weekend Super Round against Bradthorne's Reds. A colour no team wants to see more of than they have to. Dewey Priest's one news. The rugby community is mourning the passing of former player and coach Steve Cumberland. A fierce prop, Cumbi played for Manawatu from 1985 to 87, before moving south, notching 81 games for Otago. Rugby fans may remember Cumbi and an entertaining Otago side winning the championship in 91. Cumberland then moved into coaching with Otago, the Highlanders and the Kobe Steelers in Japan and has been remembered fondly for his loyalty and devotion to family. He was 57 years old. The NRLs acknowledged criticism of inconsistent refereeing may be justified in the wake of the Warriors' loss to the roosters on the weekend. The Kiwi side felt aggrieved by a series of decisions, including this apparent interference at the Ruck, which wasn't penalised. The Warriors were stung for a similar act later in the match. It's probably justifiable the way the referee referee and the bunker ruled on these two incidents. But if we talk about consistency, which I know is bandied around a lot, the way that these two incidents were approached certainly doesn't help us to avoid criticism of inconsistency. They'll have a few more days left to stew on it with the next match against the storm on Anzac Day. It wasn't meant to be a contest. The might of the Parramatta Eels up against the winless West's Tigers. But after Coach Michael Maguire changed a couple of players' stripes, the claws came out on a special night in Sydney. This was the moment the West's Tigers fortunes turned around. He got it! He got it! Jackson Hastings wins the game! And the rugby league guards finally shine on Michael McGuire and the West's Tigers. Coach Michael Maguire had been staring down the barrel after an historically bad zero from five start to the season. If anyone deserves to celebrate, it's that man. Jackson Hastings' field goal against Parramatta in the last five seconds of the game could well have saved the Kiwis coach his NRL job. The last five weeks haven't been good enough. I suppose coach is under pressure, club's under pressure, and there's only one way to show that you care about someone or something that's go out there and put a performance on and we finally did it, but I can't even give match a big hoden. Surely the feeling was mutual. Hastings called in from the UK Super League and in a new position at number seven had a hand from the very first points. If it comes to Hastings, the chip-kick. Not for Uber! Yes, yes, yes! Oh, the Tigers! Where has this been? The Tigers finally unleashed as they held on in front of 30,000 Eels fans until that final glorious moment. Jackson Hastings has delivered for the West Tigers. Can you believe it? They've got to enjoy this. It's obviously been a bit of time between how to celebrate. But one thing I do know, the boys will jump back in when the time's right to get on to the next one. But I might have a beer, boys. Boy, does he deserve it. The final sprint for Birmingham is now underway with 100 days to go until the Commonwealth Games begin. A group of Kiwi athletes gathering to mark the occasion in Auckland today, including one older hand popping in with some words of wisdom. Kimberly Downs reports. The countdown on for the Commonwealth Games class of 2022. This is just such a hype and it's really exciting. And what better way to mark 100 days until one of the world's biggest multi-sport events than dress up a bunch of high-performance athletes and test them across multiple sports. A bit of fun, yes, but it's also pretty fitting for the likes of Olympic bronze medalist Hayden Wilde, still determined to qualify for the 5,000 meters in addition to the triathlon. I just love running. I love running fast in a way when I get home. Sometimes, you know, you just don't want to think about shot. And, you know, it's quite nice just to step away from triathlon for a few months and really just focus on something else. Wild's ways clearly working. The 24-year-old recently joining an elite club signing a sponsorship deal with Red Bull. Nico Porteous, Braden Curry and Max Fasper, just to be one of the members of the family is an incredible honour. Also shooting for a con game's debut, basketballer Alifoto, with three-on-three said to make its maiden appearance. Honestly, huge, like big dream, everyone says it, but like, ever since three-on-three came onto the scene, I've been really wanting to do events like that. From potential debutants to veterans. No, don't get your hopes up, Dame Vail's still retired, but she does have plenty to offer, including some words of wisdom for those still trying to make the cut. Hey, listen, keep working, You know, keep sticking to your knitting and, you know, don't lose hope because you still got 100 days. There's a few events coming up for a lot of these athletes so they know what they've got to do. Take your marks. For these athletes, the next 100 days will go by in a flash. Kimberly Downs, One News. Finally tonight, we already know how multi-talented retired tennis champion Ash Barty is, be it on the tennis court or the cricket pitch. But now she's set to show off her skills in yet another sport. The 25-year-old confirmed to play in a global exhibition golf tournament in the US in June. Now, these pictures are from a hit and giggle for the WTA a few years ago, but still give you a decent idea of her swing. It's the closest indication yet that Vardy might pursue the sport in her post-tennis life. The event is in New York's nine-hole team match play format where she'll be joined by the likes of Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, and Tottenham striker, Harry Kane. Gosh, what can't she do, eh? Not much on it, think. Ten or pie. Maybe throw a netball like Hayden Wild? Maybe. All right. Thanks, Hayley. See you soon. After the breakdands here with some more wet weather on the cards for some of us. And then coming up on 7th Sharp, inflation is about to hit a record high.

Hello for Summers. It's been another grey old day, but for down south, you had a lovely treat this morning. Check this out. Lovely looking scene. Peter Warren, thank you for this. Great looking shot. Look at this. It's coming. It's coming. We get around there. All of Great looking shot. Look at this. It's coming. We get around there. All of a sudden you get to the sunrise. It's coming. And then boom, right there. Love looking sky. Shield of cloud, the reason why. Let's go back to the weather maps. And, of course, that shield of cloud was that one there. The perfect little canvas from Mother Nature to bring us that lovely looking sunrise. Always the signs of stuff to come. Yes, she knows. That down there. Two little pieces, one low from Australia, and the southern ocean comes to life. But we've had all that moisture streaming across parts of Northland and Auckland. That will still sit there, moist flow, lots of watches and mornings. Next couple of days, Wednesday and Thursday, heads up as these fronts. First one tomorrow, this warm front here, just sort of bends down across the West Coast. Spell of rain. That turns heavy to the West Coast by the end of the day. To the far south you get it, you just open the door to the flow. Still spells of rain to the far north. But it's all this stuff, and I just want to show you something. I'll run this through the next couple of days, Wednesday into Thursday. That's accumulated rainfall. And, of course, where you see it going yellow to orange, that's over 100 millimeters. West Coast, one to 200 millimeters of rain. And notice the spots the Bay of Plenton. You can see the scale there. So in a 100 millimeters. West coast, one to 200 millimeters of rain. And notice the spots the Bay of Plenton. You can see the scale there. So in a nutshell, wet west and far north, and even parts of Southland, you could get a good dosing of some rain as this collection of front slide through. Tomorrow. Stuck front, juicy flow, spells of rain again across parts of north and here and there. It might start to ease away as the upper energy slides away. Auckland as well. Auckland today, Walker, 50 millimetres at the airport, one millimeter, quite a contrast with the slow-moving boundary. Keep your rain coat handy tomorrow. Still going to have spells of rain. Hamilton is more likely some showers, 23 for you in the air. It's been there very humid as well, but the air coming well north of the country towards us. More likely the Bay of Plenty. We see those spells of rain here and there. One or two showers as you would drift away further south toward Topo and Tarmanui. More likely some cloud here. And 23. 22 for Toronga, you've got spells of rain again right through the course of the day. Maybe the odd heavier burst. You're seeing them as well. But not so much further east. Otherwise fine. Just some cloud. Chance for the middle of the day. Shower to Gisbon. Everyone else you are fine. Increase that cloud there, notice through the day. 25 degrees mastered and top temperature with that warm northwest flow. Top temperature by the day for the country today. 26 for Auckland, some five degrees above where we should be. Heading west, New Plymouth, you could see a shower for the afternoon. Everyone else just increased the cloud through the day with the northerly flow. Look at some of those temperatures. Palmer's, Pabas the north. 26 degrees. Yeah, some six degrees or so. Above Elmore. Wellington, 21. You've just got an increasing cloud. We're going to pick up that wind, too, as you get into the course of Thursday, of course, the approaching set of fronts. Rain works in through the door, through Nelson, through the day. That turns heavy by the end of the day, Blenham. And Westport, there you go. Heads up for that. You could get 100 millimeters of rain with this wet weather to come through. Heads up Nelson, through the day. That turns heavy by the end of the day, Blenham and Westport. There you go. Heads up for that. You could get 100 millimetres of rain with this wet weather to come through. Heads up for that onto the West Coast. Christchurch, increasing cloud. Maybe a spot of rain overnight. 22. That, of course, is the warm flow for you. Head further west, there's your rain. Rain warnings, of course, and further east. You've just got increasing cloud. Maybe a spot of rain. Ashburton and Timroo. 19 degrees, Queensland. Get your raincoat handy, the late part of the morning. We'll see some of the wet weather working through the course of the afternoon as the whole front slides through and you'll pick it up on the west coast, that warm front. Just think of it as a boundary, just some juicy air. That slides in by the afternoon. Most seeing spots of rain from Gore in Vicargle. But look at those temperatures through the time. It should be about 17 for the time of year. Tomorrow in Vicargle, Gore 20 or 21. You'll be out there saying, wow, this is different. Yeah, and Deneiden. 21 degrees tomorrow is similar for you. You're picking up that wet weather as it slides in. Now, Thursday, raincoat day. Strong gusty, northerly, that's a spell of rain. Remember the heavy rain to the West Coast? That really just packs in. That'll be a good little dose of some rain watts for the risks of some flooding in places. Good cold South Wester to kick it away. That goes through Friday. And guess what? Just in time for the weekend, we might have high pressure just waiting and to build it through. So we might time it or allow us. Could be some significant rain Wednesday and Thursday. All right. Thanks very much for that. Dan. We'll see you soon. It is time now for Seven Sharp."}
