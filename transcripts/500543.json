So I can say this might take some time but I can see there's also something going on and we can't just leave with it. So what I'll probably do next is go and talk to one of the senior leadership team to see if we can maybe get family involved as well or where to go from here get a plan because there's something going on the side of the scenes and if we don't deal with it um see that might go really real south when teachers have come to me they turn around and say that they're concerned that um that students will be angry at them or or vice versa how do you how do you think we deal with that so it's really important to know that researchers have found there are significant changes that happen in the teenage brain. And the teenage brain can actually happen anywhere for the ages of 13 to 25. And researchers have found that teenagers see fear as anger. So if a student came to me and said, I've got depression, and I was really worried or fearful for them, that teenager is likely to see that is anger. So a lot of teachers get the response from students they were angry when they think, no, I wasn't at all. So it's really important that you say something like, I'm not angry, I am so glad that you came to tell me. And then they'll understand your emotions. Okay, thank you very much."}
