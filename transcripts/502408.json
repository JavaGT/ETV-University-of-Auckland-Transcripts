In San Francisco Bay, a facility famed for breakouts subjected to a daring break-in. In this case, the idea of who is the invader and who is the invaded is pretty blurred. And a micronation off the coast of England stormed by a band of mercenaries. So Sealand was now occupied by a gang of Germans with guns and plenty of money. Decaying relics, ruins of lost worlds, sights haunted by the past, their secrets waiting to be revealed. Hugging the banks of the river glan in west central France is a settlement that appears derelict yet tenderly preserved. This looks like the perfect place to have a very happy, very productive agricultural village. So why is there no one here? What's striking is how everything is in about the same degree of decay, as if this town was abandoned and destroyed all at once. You come into the church and you see this giant bell, but it's not right, it's been melted, and you can't imagine what kind of heat must have done that. Nearby, in the village's cemetery, rows of neat headstones seem unremarkable until you look closer. Many of the graves share the same date, and many of the graves belong to children. Your heart just sinks. It makes you wonder what on earth happened here? For me, it's traversed the village. We're a pelerinage. We imagine the life of the avant, we imagine these people who lived, who had been his own. imagine these people who lived, who had been his own. Philippe Le Croix has been mayor of this area since 2014. His village and these desolate ruins share the same name. Orador Sogland. Its ghostly streets disguise a prosperous past. He was very commercial. He was a commercial. There were a lot of commerce, of professions liberal. It's a village that was very active. We had around 1,600 habitants on the ensemble of the commune. Day-trippers, shoppers, and pupils attending the village's two schools further swelled its numbers. Among them were members of Philippe's family. So why has this thriving community vanished? One clue is this ancient car that's sitting in a very prominent location, gradually rusting away. This is a very particular type of car. It's a Pujo 202, a model that was introduced just a couple of years before World War II. The fate of Orador is wrapped up in the chaos and destruction of the Second World War. But this relatively tranquil part of France never echoed to the sound of battle, or the waves of bombers that pounded Europe from the skies. The village lay in the so-called free zone of France. While the Germans occupied the north and west of the country, this was an area administered by the Vichy regime, French collaborators who ruled on behalf of their German masters. Life in Vichy, France, was a very tenuous affair. In theory, they had a certain amount of governmental autonomy, and yet the German military was always there hovering over everything and always suspicious of the local population. They're going to be essentially left alone, as long as they do what they're told, as long as they collaborate or at least don't actively fight against the Germans that are in the area. Not every French citizen was so compliant. Bands of guerrilla fighters collectively known as the resistance disrupted the German war effort in any way possible. You can imagine the fault lines of distrust running through French society during this period. For four years, Orador-e Glan existed under this uneasy atmosphere. But then, events far away on the beaches of northern France would change everything. The date was the 6th of June, 1944, D-Day. The liberation of France had begun. Seeing the German defeat imminent galvanizes the French, it fires up the French spirit. The French resistance is ramping up their activities. They're becoming more aggressive and taking even more risks. The sense of excitement must have been overwhelming. Here, finally, after years, the Allies were coming to save France from the Germans. The villagers must have thought they can only hold on until the Allies get there. What we know simply is that, Auradur, there was no resistance. And as they never did, he was not, well, protected. So for them, for the Radunod and the Radun, they were, they were in security. For her, the war was finished. But on the 10th of June, 1944, that was all set to change. Four days after D-Day, German soldiers arrived. of June 1944, that was all set to change. Four days after D-Day, German soldiers arrived. The villagers had no idea why. Philippe recalls speaking to eyewitness Robert Hebrun about how he felt during this mysterious visit. Where his mom, he said, you'd have to be in Germany. He said, but I see every day. I see some of the soldiers every day at Limoges. He never did anything, my papers are in reg, we're not risked anything. So, here the population and the villagers were completely tranquil. Unfortunately, these were not the typical German troops Robert had lived alongside for the last four years. These were members of the second SS Panzer Division, Das Reich. The SS is, in a sense, the Nazi party's own army. It's Hitler's own army. own army, it's Hitler's own army. It's separate from the older, more traditional German army. They were the fanatics of the German army, trusted to carry out Hitler's most barbaric orders without hesitation. The unit that crossed the village's bridge that warm afternoon were ominously known as Der Fuhrer regiment. Led by SS commander Adolf Diekman and hard-bitten from years of fighting in hellish conditions on the eastern front, they had been resupplying in the area when they received the order to move north to reinforce their beleaguered comrades in Normandy. The whole German armed forces operating in the Soviet Union have been brutalized. Their humanity is gone. These are no longer soldiers in wartime. These are monsters in uniform. They weren't just passing through. They came like they had a mission. The SS troops said they needed to check people's papers. They started running everybody up, pulling them out of shops and homes, and assembling them in the central square. And then they've evoked the idea that there were arms and that those who were detainers of arms, we'd have they were to search and those who who had not an arm would be relashed. It was a way, effectively, at the moment where the population had come to have some anxieties, to be neutralized and to reassure. It was all a lie. Minute by minute.

In fact, Deekman and the Derfurer regiment were carrying out a murderous plan they had used throughout the Eastern Front. The SS comes up onto this village, and they're very clever about the way they do this, right? They come in one end of the town, but only half of them do. The other half goes to the other end and surrounds the town so that no one can escape. They began to divide the town's people up into groups. The women and children were taken and ordered inside the local church, the biggest building in town. Groups of men were taken to a variety of barns and other buildings in smaller groups and ordered inside those structures. You can only imagine the anxiety, the fear that was going through these people's minds. But I doubt they really expected what would happen next. The terrible events here shocked the world and posed questions that many are still struggling to answer today. Once the villages were all split up, the murdering began. This was one of the six killing sites, the Lordy Barn. Here, after the initial volley of fire, the German soldiers passed among their victims, shooting anyone that moved. Then they set the building on fire. Five men, including Robert Hebra, played dead before escaping the inferno. As similar horrors unfolded in the other barns, more than 400 women and children huddled together in San Martin Church. There is no mercy for them, even in a house of worship. They attempted to set off some kind of a smoke bomb or a gas bomb to kill the people inside. There was an explosion, a fumate, which is repended, effectively, in the church. But, so the effect of the chaleur, because we were, in the plain month of June, it was hot. So the effect of the chaleur and, just, of this gas, and, the vitron exploded. So, de l'all, is entered in the church. It's at this moment where the SSerre and entered in the church. It's at a part of the moment where the SS are revenued in the church, they've been on the women and on the children. Once they subdued most of the occupants, the SS palled wood on top of their bodies. Some still alive and set the place ablaze. In the chaos, some sensed an opportunity. A local woman, Madame Rufanche, she saw her own daughter killed when the shooting began. She knew that there was a step ladder behind the altar. She got the step ladder and propped it up, climbed out through the window and dropped 10 feet to the ground. A mom, with her baby, they've they've got to see it, they've got to be in the press, just the the baby had cried. So, a sentinel, was at proximity, she had approached, to kill the mom, the baby, to try on Madame Ruffange, who has received several ball, and who has made to pass for mort, they've been for morted, and so they have not been achieved, and she had been found out of the next one day. Elsewhere, soldiers searched the village for anyone that had evaded the initial roundup and finished them off. Then, they set up camp. They don't leave, they don't march away as they set these buildings on fire. Instead, they find a nice space and spend the night. They had no remorse. They had no feelings that they needed to escape from the thing that they had done. They stayed there and almost celebrated the devastation that they had just caused. By the time the SS departed, only seven people are thought to have survived the horror. 643 had been brutally murdered. I think that it would have to remember, this drama, it has been very very doleously, in particular by the mares, the mers who have who have died who have disappeared in the massacre, but you have also the children of the village who were present Orado this day, so after the war, you were you're with the village without without any children. As the ruins smoldered, one question remained, why was Orado so glan targeted? The commanding officer of the Derifura regiment was angry that a German officer had been captured by the French resistance and the response was to kill the local population as a demonstration of German power. But normally when that happens, there's a lot of grandstanding and verbalization that this is why and messaging. But there was none of that. There's no good explanation other than just pure cruelty. Even some of the battalion's SS superiors were appalled by their actions. Deekman faced a court-martial, but soon he and many of his murderous comrades were killed in the battles raging in Normandy and the matter forgotten. Eventually in 1953, some of the soldiers from the SS unit were tried for their part in the massacre. Two of them were sentenced to death, while the others were given a prison sentence of only eight to 12 years. Survivor Madame Rufant, having spent a year recovering from five gunshot wounds, was there to give evidence. But the death sentences were never carried out, and the men released soon after. General Charles de Gourde decreed that the village should never be rebuilt, but remain a memorial to French suffering and sacrifice. A new village was built nearby, where Madame Rufantz remained until her death in 1988. Its present mayor, Philippe, has his own deep connection to this harrowing sight. The 10th June, I per semitre my family in the massacre of Orado-Dur-Glan. I per my uncle, my uncle and my aunt, it's a dear, the frere of my grandpair and his wife, and our three little cousins who had three years, two years and 16 years. In our family, we're not not the same, but I'm not the only, many of families were in this case that. We're not very little. Very little. That why, I've always thought that it had all to do it for that not to be reproduce not. Today, these haunting ruins and their tragic story attract people from across the globe.

As you come up on this, this looks like an abandoned oil platform or something like that with these two big towers that are kind of rusting, but it's too small to be a modern oil rig. There's no dock, there's no jetty. You just pull your boat up, tie it on, and ask the people up above to haul you up on deck. Once you're on board, you can see that the whole thing is just bodged together. It's got masses of rusting old metal, rivets that are decades old and everything just slazzered in black paint. But inside, a signs of recent habitation. The structure in the middle looks like it's been randomly thrown together. It's steampunk meets Swiss family Robinson. The fact that we have evidence of stuff left lying around says that perhaps there was no organized departure from this place. Perhaps people left in a hurry. Perhaps they haven't left at all. What makes this rusting platform so precious that it would find itself in the middle of an international conflict? Liam Bates knows this place better than most. It was a lot less welcoming back then. There were heavy machine guns all over the place. It was very much an active working fortress. It would have been quite a frightening place to be. There were mines here, some of which scraped by the inside of the towers, but didn't luckily explode, otherwise we wouldn't be stood here today. This is a Montsel fort, built when Britain faced invasion. So this platform was built during World War II with the idea that it was going to be a defensive position, something that's going to keep the Germans from laying mines in the area, and it's going to be a forewarning if German aircraft come towards the shore. There were loads of these built in the North Sea, but after the war, most of them were demolished, but not this one apparently. So this room in wartime in the Second World War would have been for the officers to spend time in. It was part of the honor of being, you know, a higher-ranking officer to be able to actually spend some time up on the deck level because the Marines and sailors would have been spending the vast majority of their day down in the towers. During the war, there would be anything from 100 to 300 Royal Marines and naval personnel stationed here for the size. That's a lot of people. But things have changed since this was a Royal Navy garrison. This is the home of Prince Liam of the Principality of Sealand. In 1966, Liam's grandfather, Roy Bates, lived in the UK. He ran a pirate radio station. In Britain, back in the 50s, and right on through the 60s, commercial radio wasn't really a thing. And people created illegal commercial radio stations called pirate radio stations by putting them on top of buildings in city centers. That would be hard to detect. Roy Bates made money broadcasting pop records, but it was against the law. And the British government did everything they could to use every law in the book to shut them down. And for all intents and purposes, they did. So my grandpa, not being the kind of man that could take no for an answer, he thought, well, where's the next jurisdiction? Where's out the UK government reach? Roy put his young family on a fishing trawler and sailed to a site outside British territorial waters. They get to this platform and claim it as their own. They raise a flag that they've designed themselves, declare themselves prince and princess of the new principality of Sealand. And he thought, well, if there's no man's land and no one has jurisdictions, this is mine. Prince Roy declared it a principality mainly for practical reasons. He couldn't declare it a kingdom and call himself the king, because the Queen of England might have had a thing or two to say about that. I think as well as another excuse for another big adventure, so off he went, further out to sea. From Sealand, Prince Roy could broadcast radio signals outside the law. But the outpost also became a home. So this is a bedroom. It's got all the creature comforts you'd expect anywhere in the world. We've got power outlets, which are actually powered by over 95% renewable energy. The decoration in here isn't really to my taste, but there's all kinds of characters and people from all walks of life stay here. I don't know if you can hear but that's actually the waves lapping up against the side of the tower, which is lovely and relaxing when you're trying to get off to sleep. And if you follow me through here, we have another bedroom. Apart from being one hell of a conversation starter, Sealand was the real long-term home of Prince Roy and his family. But they also found a way to work the land as a data storage center for companies and individuals that didn't want governments prying on their information. Well, trying to sum my grandfather up in a few words is a bit challenging. Harder's nails, larger than life, and he just had this sheer passion for adventure. Yet Sealand was about to receive some unwelcome guests. In August of 1978, they arrived unannounced, and Liam's father, Prince Michael, was home alone. Michael was home alone. A helicopter approached from the direction of Europe over there. And as they approached, he was trying to persuade them not to land, you know, waving them away when he recognised who they were. On board was a German, a business associate of his father's. And the man said that he'd just done some business deal with Michael's father and now needed to come on board to sign some paperwork. The main defense is very rudimentary. It's actually just this mask that you can see here. And that will prevent helicopters from being able to land because it's quite a small space anyway. Michael is not feeling really good about this, but there was just enough truth to the story that the Germans were giving him, that he said, okay, and lowered the defenses. A group of men stepped onto Sealand. Each of them armed. The invaders grab hold of Michael and they lock him up. I think his main concern, as he's told me over the years, was that he was put in this room with no food or water, and nobody knew he was here, apart from the guys that had thrown him in here. There is no way out. The whole room you're standing in now is made of steel that's nearly an inch thick designed to withstand, you know, strafing from the Luftwaffe. So, I mean, there literally would have been no means of escape. Sealand had been conquered, and Prince Michael was a prisoner in his own home. The mercenaries, inspired by the idea of an international takeover, had grand plans to expand sea land with additional forts, a bank, hotel and casino. Yet, after just three days, and without explanation, they let Prince Michael go. The Germans agree to put Michael out of the cell and onto a boat, three days and without explanation, they let Prince Michael go. The Germans agree to put Michael out of the cell and onto a boat. They ship him to the Netherlands without his passport, making it very difficult. Whatever the reason, releasing him would soon backfire. A few days after my father was released from captivity, him and his father hatched a plan to recapture sealand. They codenamed it Operation Trident. Fortunately for Roy, he has a friend who is not only a stunt person, but flies helicopters for shows like James Bond. They take the doors off, they bring ropes with them, and they arm themselves. They fly out to sealand. To approach sealand stealthily, they made sure that they approached into the wind, and that would suppress the sound of the helicopter to a great degree. They also flew very close to the sea, and the absolute maximum speed that the helicopter would allow. When they arrived over sealand, they noticed that the Germans have put the anti-helicopter defences up. So Roy and his team repelled from the helicopter down onto sealand, and they were armed with shotguns. I don't think that they ever stopped to consider that they might get killed. Obviously, it was a risk. They went out armed with the teeth. Even the pilot had a revolver in his jacket, you know, because they just single-mindedly came out here to do a job. They rappel down to the platform and they fire one shot of a rifle. And this big boom. My father launched himself off of the helipad down onto the deck here, at which point the butt of his saw-off shotgun, hit the deck, let a round off right next to his head, and all of the invaders ran out of the buildings with their arms in the air in surrender. The invaders decided that they weren't so into this fight after all. They weren't willing to go down fighting for the glory of Sealand. But Roy was. Forget comedians and cars getting coffee.

The prince had retained the throne of Sealand, but there would be retribution for crimes against the crown. Prince Roy let most of the Germans go, but not the one who had masterminded the coup and beaten up his son. His name's Putz. Putz was tried for treason by my grandfather. He was sent to the jail down at the bottom of a North Tower here. Apparently, they took good care of their prisoner. He was fed and watered and allowed up to the surface for fresh air every now and then. But it was a very small and shabby jail cell, and he was kept there for three months. The UK government were contacted by the German embassy to say, look, this has happened on what they considered British territory, and the UK government responded by saying, this is outside of our jurisdiction, you must deal with this yourself. It gets to the point where Germany sends a diplomat from their London office to Sealand to negotiate for the release of this German national. Of course, Bates does release the prisoner and lets him go. He would have been here indefinitely, I'm sure, if the German ambassador hadn't negotiated his release. I mean, the, you know, the punishment for treason is a lot more heavy in every other country. Since 1978, Sealand has never been invaded again. But if anyone should try, Liam's family will be ready. We have various contingency plans and plans drawn up for that kind of thing. So, yeah, we're prepared today the sovereignty of sea land remains an open question in a strictly legal sense sealand is part of the archipelago of Great Britain and so has no independent sovereignty. But the longer it's tolerated and not interfered with, arguably the more rights it and its people may acquire. And the invasion may have had an unintended benefit when Prince Roy hosted the German ambassador. He uses that point from that moment forward that Germany is essentially recognizing the principality of Sealand as a legitimate nation, and that is the tool that they're able to use from that moment forward. Quite a moment for Sealand, in a political sense, you know, as many international politicians have said, that's de facto recognition. In San Francisco Bay, on a tiny outcrop, is a complex everyone knows. The setting is iconic. You can see the San Francisco skyline. There's no doubt about where you are. Known as the Rock, it's possibly the most infamous prison in the world. Everybody knows it as one of the most remote and secure prisons in all of history. Surrounded by icy waters, escape stories both real and imagined have become legendary. But once upon a time, a determined group actually decided to break in. This is a lesser-known story about Alcatraz. But equally as significant as the rest, Al-Kajas became a place of symbolic resistance. In this place, the line is blurred between who are the invaders and who are the invaded. It's hail and farewell to Alcatraz. The Red Rock in San Francisco Bay placed host to the press on its closing day. Shut down in 1963, it was designated surplus land by the federal government. Six years later, though, a group set out on a mission that would capture the world's attention. As one journeys through this once penal institution, one sees the signs of recent occupation. These signs indicate that this became a place of resistance. sees the signs of recent occupation. These signs indicate that this became a place of resistance. There's writing on the water tower. And then you go to the cell blocks, and there's writing in its names of American presidents. Why are their names written in these prison blocks? Those responsible for this scrawling saw this as a place where a great injustice could be challenged. Elijah Oaks' family was among them. So when the occupiers first arrived on the island, my grandfather and my family ended up staying right over here, a second window from the sign. Elijah's grandfather was one of 14 indigenous Americans who made it past the Coast Guard on a cold night in 1969. They called themselves the Indians of all tribes. And when they landed on Alcatraz, they dispersed in all directions to assume control. They had real plans. They wanted to start an American Indian Cultural Center. They wanted to start a school. They wanted to make this something special. The organizers also saw it as a platform for them to get out an urgent message about what was going on in Native communities around the country. Native Americans to this very day are subject to extreme racism, they have fewer economic opportunities, and let's not forget that the entire continent once belonged to them. Elijah's grandfather was Richard Oakes, leader of the revolt. For him, this small island could symbolize the fact that this continent was once all theirs. Indians of all tribes decided to occupy Alcatraz because, in my grandfather's words, now on one side of the United States, you have a statute of liberty, and this is pretty much the entire opposite. The quote from my grandfather is that those entering Golden Gate would first see Indian land, thus the reminder of the true history of this nation. Land once ruled by freeing over Indians. Occupying federal land was hugely controversial. But to many, what they were doing was simply reclaiming what was rightfully theirs. It's a spectra. I thought you said the road was closed.

For 400 years, the Native Americans had been robbed and their land had been stolen from them. The island of Manhattan, for example, was sold on the basis of a few colored beads and silk cloth. It is this precedent that Native American activists seized upon when they took Alcatraz and said that they would also pay $24 worth of beads and some silk cloth for the island of Alcatraz in recompense of what the Americans had done to them. As far as the Indians of all tribes were concerned, this wasn't an invasion. It was a reclamation. The land that was once theirs would be so again. And this place of imprisonment would become their place of freedom. In fact, it was written into U.S. law that the indigenous American people had rights to this land. So Alcatraz had been labeled as surplus land. And under a number of treaties, surplus land was supposed to be available for occupation by Native American people. This clause was probably one of those that the writers had never intended that Native Americans would be able to act upon. But that's precisely what these activists intended to do. Acting upon the letter of American law. But living on an abandoned prison island would prove challenging. They had to establish shelter, food, and how they were going to deal with the media. Most of the occupiers moved into the Broadway cell block, and you had whole families living behind bars in cells that once held America's most dangerous criminals. Of course, this is an isolated space. It's an island, and they don't have the ability to grow food. They don't have wells for water. So everything has to be brought in by ships and get around the Coast Guard who's trying to actively stop them from getting supplies. At first, what they were doing was greeted with admiration by many. Money and supplies flooded in. The occupiers found the perfect billboard for their cause, the water tower, easily visible for miles around. So they put slogans up like, welcome to free Indian land, Indians welcome. Prison cells were assigned to those responsible for racist policy. Among them, Governor of California, Ronald Reagan. Their message was strong and clear, and the people of America were listening. But something was about to happen that would change everything. In early 1970, about six months after the occupation had begun, there's a fire. We don't know how it was started, but the warden's house is burned down. And importantly, the lighthouse is destroyed by fire. Now, this is going to be significant because the lighthouse was still actively used there in San Francisco Bay. And not long after, you have two oil ships that collide and spill hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil. So this is a real turning point. Luckily, no one was killed in the fire, but it's at that point that the headlines turned against the occupiers. And you started to see stories about how they were anarchists or hooligans or just students too lazy to work. Though the occupiers claimed they didn't cause the fire and made attempts to fix the lighthouse, public support waned. And then the group were dealt another blow. Richard Oaks was such an important part of the leadership of the occupation of Alcatraz. But tragically, his 13-year-old stepdaughter died. What had happened is that they were playing in the Ira Hayes building, and she had slipped and fall while she was playing with other children, and they had called 911, and they had flown her to Oakland Hospital. And two to three days later, she was pronounced dead. And, yeah, at that point, my family had decided that they were going to leave it's too big of a tragedy with their charismatic leader gone gone others soon followed the nixon administration seized its opportunity. The government took the extraordinary step of cutting off the electoral supply to the island. At that point, life on Alcatraz, already in hospitable, became even more difficult. In June of 1971, the federal government finally decided to send in agents to forcibly remove anyone still on the island, going against the very laws they themselves had set. The following year, Richard Oaks was killed, and the white man who shot him was acquitted of all charges. The occupation of Alcatraz didn't turn into the kind of permanent outpost that the organizers had hoped for, but their message did endure. They inspired an entire generation of American Indians, of indigenous people, to take their own charge, to have their own voice in the civil rights movement and the activism of the day. It's a real sense of honor to be out here in a experience the island now, you know, and the impact that it's led for the entire indigenous rights movement. It's a tremendous legacy. It really is. It's powerful indeed. Yeah. You know,"}
