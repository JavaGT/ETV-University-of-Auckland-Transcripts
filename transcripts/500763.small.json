Good morning, Ryan, good morning, good morning. Good morning, Ryan, good morning, good morning, Ryan, good morning, good morning, good morning, Ryan, good had your coffee yet. I have a coffee bag at the ready. I can back you up. Coffee bag. Goodness me, that sounds flash. I'm secretly hoping that's hoping that Emily who works on the program is very good. TV. Emily what are you doing? Speaking of bags, I was just reading on my emails an email to AirPoint members from Air New Zealand. Because that's about all you can buy with AirPoint, it's a shopping bag. Yes, well suitcases apparently are the big thing that everybody is going on buying now because we're travelling again. But Air New Zealand is asking passengers to pack light in a bid to reduce carbon emissions because the light of the plane, the less fuel you use. So we all turn up naked. I mean seriously, they want us to fly to London with no clothes. The thing is, you know what happens when you fly with an empty bag? You come home with shopping. I was going to say, I'm quite happy to go with the empty bag. We'll not be coming home with the empty bag. I go with a full bag and come home with an extra bag full of other stuff. I'm terrible I'm a terrible packer. I mean it's a nice sentiment. Is this seriously what that what New Zealand is suggesting? It's a nice sentiment isn't it? It's nice but no one, I was thinking about the, sorry, the carbon credits, you know when you book your airfare, you can offset your carbon emissions. Have you ever done it? Not once. And I think the problem is that you do it in the privacy of your own home. And the thing about global warming and climate change is everybody talks a big game, but in the privacy of your own homes, you don't care, right? You don't give a stuff I think what they should do and this is my free advice to New Zealand's morning because clearly they needed if this is what they come up with good morning in New Zealand my advice is when they put the boarding passes if you have offset your carbon emissions you get a green colored boarding pass so you will prance around the terminal yes just like just like you do at the supermarket when you've got your own bags. It's like, yes, you know, look at my bags. So base is shame people. Yeah, because that's what motivates people, isn't it? Because do you, but do you when you go to a shop and you know some shops you buy something and they say, would you like to add a dollar on for this charity? Do you do that then? Because then you're looking someone in the face. Shaming people into it. People do it because they are put on the spot. Exactly right Melissa. I don't do that. I don't do that. I don't do that. What do you say? Do you just say oh not to the children? Don't worry about the children. I want to give my dollar. Yeah, not today, but also not tomorrow. But the thing is, I like to give to charities that I want to support. And I don't know, I don't actually know where that money's going. You know, when you go to some of those stores and they say, buy this tote bag for $2, and that'll go to the charity. Will it? How much of it? and how much is administrationresis? a tote-bed. It's not like you're getting nothing. You're getting the bag. Yeah, but I would like to give because I, you know, am supporting something I care about. Not because I... Not because I want a new world tote bag. So basically, good luck, New York, you know, good luck, New Zealand, New Zealand, but no. We'll try, maybe, I might try. It is coming up to six o'clock and we have got lots on the show this morning. We're bracing ourselves course for the highest inflation in the last 30 years when data is announced later this morning.

We'll find out more about this with clinical psychologist Dougal Sutherland in 10 minutes. Prince Harry has visited the Queen who's turning 96 today. happy birthday, our Europe correspondent Lisa Raimer has the details of that meeting at 640, right now it's time for news. At Mariette, six o'clock. All eyes will be on stats New Zealand today with the next inflation rate to be revealed later this morning. The rates expected to hit a 30-year high with some experts predicting it'll go over 7%. The government is citing global factors such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine is the main factors for the surge. But actually, David Seymour told AM early, there's more the government can do to bring living costs down. I would start by looking at the growth in bureaucracy, the growth in expenditure, the growth in waste and say actually we could afford to give the average worker back $2,000 by cutting the middle income tax rate straight away. Just under a turn has arrived in Tokyo, ahead of her first meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister. The PM touched down early this morning and was greeted on the tarmac by a small welcoming party. She's taken her fourth COVID test of the trip, a PCR swab on arrival, three members of her delegation tested positive for COVID early in the week. She'll meet with Prime Minister Formio Kashida later today, her first meeting with him since he took office last year. The once popular why we had a Pools are making a comeback with the site being bought after two years of abandonment. The complex closed its doors in February 2018 after the previous owners defaulted on their payments and walked away from the business. The park is currently undergoing a revav with a $250 million plan to get the hydroslides, hot pools and day start spark back up and running. The new owners hope to have the park back in action within the next couple of years. Russia has added fuel to fears of global conflict, testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile. It's being described as a warning to war who tried to oppose Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin is also fighting an economic battle on home soil as inflation in Russia hits its highest since early 2002, accelerating to more than 17%. Putin says the West has a lot to answer for and should be stopped. These were illegal restrictions imposed on our companies by foreign states. We know this. And we're not just talking about the ban on exports, also the ban on imports of components of steel production like rolled products, steel sheets, fittings and so on. This breaches the World Trade Organization's principles. The Pentagon has responded to the missile test saying it was notified before Russia's the routine launch. Spain is experiencing its heavy staple snow in the last two decades. People are trapped in their homes and emergency services are struggling to access the worst affected areas. According to Spain's traffic agency, more than 30 roads have been seriously affected with motorists struggling to sail the tarmac. Local authorities expect the storm to linger for at least another 48 hours. In sport, Russian and Belarusian players will be barred from competing at Wimbledon this year due to the invasion of Ukraine. The All England Lawn Tennis Club said it had a responsibility to limit Russia's global influence through the strongest means possible. The highest ranked players to be impacted are the men's world number two, Daniel Medvedev and women's world number four, Arena Sublinka of Belarus. The Law and Tennis Association's ban on Russian and Belarusian tennis players extends to all UK grass court tournaments.

It is 5 past 6. How good is that news? It's very good. Yeah, hopefully the fans get along too. It's not that far away. And it means we'll have lots of footage as well that we can use here on the program. Oh, it'll be highlight after highlight, yep, and I'll be great. It's 5 after 6.. after highlight. Yep, that would be great. It's five after six. Reading this morning about a controversial I guess leave rule that has been instituted at Pacific Media Network, it's one of a few companies in New Zealand who has started giving what would call period leave. So they are giving 12 days off a year for menstrual cycle and menopausal leave. This is began at the beginning of this year. This is on top of your sick leave which has gone from five days to ten days. Wow. And employees there are particularly the women who was fighting it who is an EU delegate, Lucia Petello, has said that you know every now and then women just need some time off at home to deal with the pain that comes along with these kinds of things. Okay couple of questions do all women have the pain that would require you to stay home or is it only some women? I believe it's only some. Okay and what happens when a woman reaches menopause? Would you stop? Would you leave entitlement stop? Well no, because that's part of it. You can have leave for that as well. Oh right, okay, so it keeps going. Okay, so it keeps going. And what about, okay, I'm just working through this. What about if you have, like, lots of people who have in the Zealand have like irritable bowel the have like irritable bowel syndrome for example and that means that they are having to use the bathroom all the time they're very uncomfortable they don't get any special dispensation for that so why should you have it for? It does raise the question it's the Pacific Media Network. So is this a is this an industry that has predominantly women employed there? I mean is that effect would that matter? well it could probably function just as well without them. What I'm saying is women can do it all. That's my message. I thought you meant they can do without the women. He can know, really would have been functioning. We'd be driving home. No, we'd be driving. No, we'd be driving home, putting a mascara.., but we'd be driving home, putting a mascara putting a home putting a mascara on, checking on the babysitter, we'd be doing it all in the way home, so not that way. It does raise the question doesn't it that if you had another illness could you say well I should get extra leave because of that? That's right. I guess the thing is if this is one employer who's happy to do this for their employees and who feels that they have the capacity to do that then then who really cares it's up to them good on them but you would hope they were being fair to other employees with other health issues wouldn't you and you would also start to question if it was mandated by government and that's the thing is it going to put pressure on other businesses to do the same. more and more are yeah well your feedback on this I think we would all like to hear this morning. And women you're amazing I don't mean we could do without you. It means you could do it all without being in the office. The feedback at amshow.co.nz that's feedback at amshow.co.nz. Right now we're going to go to weather. William is standing by in Auckland again this morning William, good morning you um... I won't even actually go there with you. It's a very delicate topic.

Kiwis are downing more pills for depression than ever before. latest ministry of health figures show an increase in antidepressant use in New Zealand. Up 20% in 2020, since 2010, however, a new study out this morning has shown the long-term use of antidepressants didn't lead to significantly improved outcomes for patients. So does this mean the important medication isn't doing what it needs to do? Joining me this morning is clinical psychologist Dugul Sutherland. Good morning. Does this mean that antidepressants are ineffective? It doesn't mean it's ineffective. What the study showed was that after two years, people that were taking antidepressants pretty much had the same results as people that didn't take antidepressants. But important to say that both groups improved improved, so both groups improved in their overall life outcomes, but there was no difference in two years between if you did or if you didn't take antidepressants. So what's the point in taking them? The study didn't show how quickly you made a gain. So it could be that people that took antidepressants had a sort of a quick increase, a quick increase and then stayed there or it could be that they just slowly did the same. Look, we've known that antidepressants are sort of about 50-50 in terms of how effective they are for people anyway. And is that because of they're more effective for some people than for others? Yes, they tend to be a little finicity for women, but also women are more regularly diagnosed with depression than men anyway. So there's a whole lots of sort of little finicky little bits with all this data. This was done based on a 10-year study of survey of Americans. Were the people who were given the medication as depressed at the start as the people who weren't? No good question. So the people that took anti-depressence were more depressed than the people who weren't. No, good question. So the people that took antidepressants were more depressed than the people who weren't given it. And at the end they were all roughly about the same level of happiness, which may indicate actually that they are working for those who are more depressed. That's right. That's right. It could well be the fact. And of course you want to think about antidepressants as only something in the short term anyway, probably.. And of course you want to think about antidepressants is only something in the short term anyway, probably, I would say, almost a bridge to getting back to where you want to be. Maybe you get over that bridge quicker if you're on antidepressants. Do we know, because I've always wondered, if you look, turn on the television, you look at social media, people tell us they are more depressed than we've ever been before, we're more unhappy than we've ever been before. than there's more mental health issues now than there's ever been before. And yet we have all these medications. So what gives? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shouldn't we, if we've got all these drugs, shouldn't we all be much happier and less depressed? Well I think that goes to looking at how effective those medication anyway. We know that if you really want to beat be depression, the best treatment is going to be a combination of anti-depresent medications and some sort of talking therapy like cognitive, behavioral therapy. Most people, we've got a shortage of psychologists in New Zealand, so most people don't get access to talking therapies like CBT. So it's easier for them to be prescribed medication and I'm not saying that as a criticism of anybody. It's just if you're a busy GP, you've got 10 minutes, you know there are no psychologists of, you know, wouldn't you give somebody some medication if they were depressed? So you were saying if we had more psychologists in New Zealand trained psychologists, we would be giving out probably less fewer antidepressants. That could be the case yes because people may well a lot of people we know that people want psychological therapies you know but they can't get it. So we know people want them so I think if people give them the choice they may well at least want get them as well as medication. So if you go to your doctor you're feeling unhappy you're feeling depressed and your doctor says well you know I would first of all recommend that you have a CSO psychologist that you have some talk therapy and you can't find somebody who's available or you can't afford it should you then just go on pills? well I think antidepressants can be effective I mean the study showed that right there's 17 million people so that's an awful lot of people said that yeah after two years because remember both groups did get better. So it wasn't like all those people's antidepressants just stayed depressed. So the quality of life improved as did people that didn't take medications. So so so the message would be yeah look medication can be effective but so so can not having medication as well. Yeah. All right I guess I think because I guess the thing because it's quite shocking to hear that if we have a you know a lack of psychologists then more people are up on pills is there is there a big downside to taking pills you know are there really negative consequences? well with every medication that you take these side effects right and so that's the case with paneled for panol, for example. So, of course there will be side effects for any medication that you take. I think one thing from a psychological point of view we notice is that if people take medication and it doesn't work, they can get a bit down on themselves because, oh, you see, I've tried this and this hasn't worked either. When oftentimes they just might need to try another medication, so they might need to try another medication. So it can have that sort of effect of people going, oh well I've tried it and didn't work so then I must be incurable. And of course that's not true at all. We know depression is, well not easily, but readily treatable. And so that would be one downside I would see. Yeah, okay. And very, very interesting. Thanks so much for coming in this morning. Thanks so much for coming this morning. Great to talk to you. That is clinical psychologist Dugel Sutherland with us this morning. We'll have more details about this new survey, sorry, new study, which is out this morning on our website. It is 16 minutes after six o'clock. After the break, American Superstore Costco is set to open in New Zealand in August, but will it be the silver bullet that breaks our gross grocery dooply? We discussed that next.

What made you decide to build a new home as opposed to buying a ready-made home? Well, we just assumed we would need to buy an established house, never really occurred to us, we'd be able to afford a brand new house. Yeah, I just remember wandering around this show, I'm thinking, couldn't believe that we could get something as nice. You know, the kids moved on, you sort of might think that you'd have to compromise. It doesn't feel like we've compromised at all. We wanted to downsize.

I am great to have your company, lots of your emails coming in, your feedback this morning on the issue of a period days off for women. We'll get to that shortly. American Retail Giant Costco will open here later this year. So what does that mean for potential competition with our grocery and retail sector here to discuss this? Thanks to our partners at Milford Asset Management, as portfolio manager, Stephanie, Stephanie, just remind us what Costco is for those of us around the country who haven't heard that much about it. Yeah, sure. So we followed Costco for a number of years from an investment perspective and it's a high quality retailer. Oppressionally. And I think there are two key things to understand. The first is that it's a membership-only retailer. So you have to pay a 60 dollar annual membership fee and then you get access to everything that cost co-sells. And it's more than just groceries. It's home-ware, electronics, clothing, jewelry, petrol stations. You get access to all of that. The second thing to understand is that their entire proposition is about value for the customer, which really just means selling high-quality goods at prices lower than competitors. They talk about being the last to raise prices and the first to lower them, and that's fantastic in the current inflationary environment where, as we know, households are getting squeezed on everything from groceries to fuel to mortgages. Yeah so are those lower prices going to have any impact on competition in terms of our grocery and retail sectors here and will that bring prices down elsewhere? Okay I think having a new player in the market will certainly help on the competition front, particularly because Costco does have that laser focus on value for the customer. It is still just going to be one store at this stage, so the impact could be somewhat limited to begin with. And they do run a slightly different model, that membership model that I talked about, and it's also more of a bulk purchase format, which means that may be great for some larger households or families. It might not be quite as suitable for it's a single person or a couple, but certainly I think having Costco as a new player in the market is bound to help a little bit on the competition front and really just provide a bit more choice for both consumers as well as suppliers. You mentioned too that you've been looking into it as an investment. How is it performing? Yes, it's performed really well both in the long term and the short term. So over the last five years the share price is up about 250 percent and that's three times that of the US market. And then over the short term, so the last kind of 12 months, the share price is up 60% in the broader kind of US market, it's only up 9%. So it did very well during the pandemic, people stopped going out, stayed home, and ate at home a lot more. And then recently it's been benefiting from inflation, because as the cost of goods rise, people are increasingly turning to Costco as a trusted retailer where they know that they have the lowest prices on the market. How are they able to provide prices that are so much lower than their competitors? Yeah, there are a few factors that come into this. So the first are those membership fees. Costco makes about 60 to 70% or more of the operating profits from those membership fees, which means they can afford to take a little bit of a low margin on the merchandise. Another unique thing about Costco is that they provide a select range of products. So in the US, a typical Costco might stock sort of 4,000 different products, whereas a Walmart will stock 100,000. So Costco is buying those select products in much larger quantities, which gives them better terms with supplies and they can then pass those savings on to consumers. And you've got the bulk format for consumers which helps savings as well. Right, so set to open an Auckland store in August, or keep an eye on that, Milford asset management portfolio manager, Stephanie Bachelor, thanks Stephanie and of course we're talking business every Tuesday and Thursday, thanks to our partners at Milford. Lots of feedback already on the issue of women who would be given days off from their employer because of their periods, period, pain or discomfort, whatever you want to call it. Maureen says very nice to get extra leave, but she takes my point actually, that there are many ailments and should one problem be given priority over another. So if you've got like irritable bowel syndrome or if you've got some other medical condition shouldn't you also be given extra leave? Yeah I think the point is right if you're feeling uncomfortable that you can't go into work sure take a sick day but as part of your sick leave rather than specific period leave? Yeah that's kind of what I think too. Hmm No no there's so much going on in my head thinking. Surely it's because of a workforce predominantly with women. You're not going to give that kind of leave to a mechanics shop. I you that's just it would be redundant. But also maybe there might be more maybe there are more mechanics. Well, there are but it's a specific. Maybe they don't want the cranky women at work. And I'm saying that because I am one of them occasionally. I don't know what you're talking about. There definitely are days when you think, hmm, I wonder. There's some comments coming on. You say that or a generalization? I'm starting to think maybe it's better you guys do stay home. 26 after 6 now, lots to come on the program. Coming up next, Prince Harry's just given a tell all interview overnight while you've been sleeping. It's airing the day before his grandmother's 96th birthday. We're live to the UK before 7.

It is 630 and time for the news. with some experts predicting it'll go over 7%. The government is citing global factors such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine is the main factors for the surge. But actually, David Seymour says, is more the government can do to bring the cost of living down. I would start by looking at the growth in bureaucracy, the growth in expenditure, the growth in waste, and say actually we could afford to give the average worker back $2,000 by cutting the middle income tax rate straight away. The search for a fishman missing in the Bay of Plenty is set to enter its fifth day. A Coast Guard plane will conduct an aerial search of the coast from Waai Beach to the Monte River mouth as well as the outlying islands.

In sport Super Rugby's magic round will be under the spotlight this weekend in Melbourne as the competition tries the format for the first time. The NRL has run a magic round for the past few seasons, but the concept is the first for Super Rugby. New Zealand rugby's Chris Lindrum admits they're going into the unknown, but expects the weekend to be a big success. Intention and hope of everybody is that it works, and that it's something that we can pursue in the future. As I say, obviously it's been done in the NRL, but it's something that's pretty unique for rugby and if it works well and we can see promise for the future, we'll do it again. Discovery will be the broadcast partner for the Rugby World Cup this year. Head of Spark Sport Jeff Latch told at am early that it's an exciting time for women's sport and hopes Kiwi fans get around the blackferns. I actually think the match-ups in the competition is going to be absolutely intense. And what a magic year for sport in New Zealand to have two world cards, but particularly women's sport. I mean this is such a land-breaking year. Finally at 630 a man has enrolled his dog in the world coal-carrying championships to raise cash for charity. Dreamed up over a pint in a British pub in 1963 it's long been seen by Yorkshire locals as a test of fitness and botchness. Do we still do that? The uphill kilometer long race requires participants to carry a 50 kilo bag of coal on their backs and complete the course in the fastest time possible. The first place will receive 750 pounds, even if they're a dog. There you go. Easy cash, maybe, if you're strong. And botch, that's the very latest from News Hub. 25.. That's the very latest from News Hub that's 25 to 7. That's like the Highland Games isn't it? It's just strength. Yeah. We'd rather do the cheese rolling. Unless you get the cheese at the end of it, you get a treat. Yeah, but carrying coal on your back, that's hardy isn't it? Hardy. Hey, we've had people email in the show Bernie and they've said, and they've said, why we've, well, not complaining, not complaining about you, but about what's, but about what's the words that are coming out of your mouth. What did I say? No you did the 2021 World Cup? Right yes so would you like me to clarify? Can you for? So COVID World Cup was supposed to be last year just like the Olympic Games got put back a year well 40 years so yeah so it is the 2021 rugby world cup was supposed to be last year covered put paid to that we couldn't have crowds't have teams, so it is still the 2021 Rugby World Cup for Women held in 2022. It has been confusing but not really when you know it's back a year. Yeah and they would have done all the branding already wouldn't they? So they would have done all the branding already, wouldn't they? So they would have to do that and it was the same with the Olympics for 2020-20-20 Olympics. It was and I thought that was and I thought that was, that was kind of makes sense that think about it in the future and a hundred years' time when they look back in the history books, I think, oh, that's weird. Why is it? So it kind of makes sense that they just keep the name the same. It'll be a good quiz question though, won't it? What year was the Tokyo Olympic Power? I would think, oh, Tony, another way, bit of trivia for you this morning, because we were talking about period leave which is what Pacific Media Center is giving to some of their employees 12 days a year for women to have period leave so it got us debating do women or men take more sick leave days a year? I've had a look the latest study suggests a man calls in sick and average 140 days throughout their entire working life a woman calls in sick a total of 189. one calls in sick and average 140 days throughout their entire working life. A woman calls in sick a total of 189 days. Wow. So they're already taking more and they're working less. So that number's probably compounded. This is during their, so I should say this is during their career. Yeah, so I think you need to factor in too. If you have a child who is sick, you stay home and you look after your child, that's sick leave. Now mum or dad can do that, it is still entitled sick leave. Well that's a very traditional view of things. Lots of men stay home to look after the child. I did say all day. Not as many though. It's not cool years this morning. You want me to give you to give you a little... But how do we explain that 189 days versus 140? Is it the issue that we've been discussing? The period? I would say that's children being sick. I agree actually, Ben. Okay, feedback at amshoe.co.org, what do we think is behind that? And do you think women should be entitled to more sickly? Can you take a sick day because your kid is sick? is that allowed? I think so. Is that allowed? Yes you can. Yes, I've just... Just depends on the... Am I the only one in here this morning? Hello, hello, hello, hello. Hey on! Sorry, did you? Sorry, did you? I know what it is. You know what it is? Honestly, there's an earpiece in this side of my head. We've been here 10 weeks. We have had problems so far. You tell me and then I'll tell him in this ear and we should be all right. That was coded. I think I need a leave day. All right, it is 22 away from 7. William's been listening, he's with us this morning.. He's with us this morning, in the CDD. William, why do you think that women have, and be careful, be careful what you say, but why do you think that women would have more sick days than men? More than I, why do I think, mate? That's a good question. Plaid the fifth, say nothing. Because they have to put up, because they have to put up with us men. Oh, you hit the nail on that. It's a definite, that's it. My partner will need more than 190 days, that's for sure, whatever it was. I'm terrible. But look, this isn't terrible. Look how beautiful these lights are down here. Beautiful, photogenic,, you want to come down and get that grand spot. So just speaking on the beauty, let's check out the weather around the water.

Prince Howry has given an exclusive interview revealing an insight into his latest meeting with the Queen. Here's what he had to say. It was great. It was just so nice to see her. You know she's on grateful. We always she's always got a great sense of humor with me and I'm just making sure that she's protected and got the right people around it. It's both Megan and I had tea with her, so it was really nice to catch up with her. And you know, home for me now is, you know, for the time being in this, in the States. This all comes as the Queen turns 96 later today, and for more on this, we're joined by New Hub, Europe correspondent Lisa,amer, Lissette, he said I'm making sure that she has the right people around her. That's quite cryptic isn't it? We need to know more. Yes he actually said the word I want to make sure she's protected and a lot of people especially here in the UK are asking protected from what and unfortunately we didn't get that follow-up question so he wasn't particularly pressed on that but it is what a lot of people are wondering what is he most worried about is it about the immediate family is he worried about the aides that are around the Queen he he didn't go into it any further but certainly people here have been very disgruntled by this interview people I think it's slightly distasteful of him have described him as delusional to come out and kind of act as if he is looking after his grandmother when he didn't even come to Prince Phillips Memorial just recently. He didn't show up because of those security concerns he has. So he has ruffled some feathers certainly just, you know, away from his grandmother's birthday. He spoke very kindly of her and they clearly have a good relationship still but did he say anything about the relationship with his brother Prince William or his father Prince Charles? Yes again he was kind of asked about it well he was actually directly asked about this he he he offered up a lot of the information about the Queen unprovoked, he was kind of asked about it. Well, he was. He was actually directly asked about this. He offered up a lot of the information about the Queen unprovoked, but he was directly asked if he missed his father and his brother. And he completely dodged the question. He said he was here to focus on the Invictus games, which are taking place in the Netherlands, which is why he is why he is here and he said he misses his family in the states immensely referring to his wife Megan who had already returned at that point and of course his two young children so a lot of people also questioning why he couldn't say that he missed his his brother and his father but we do understand that he did catch up with Prince Charles for around 15 minutes so he came a long way after you know a long time of not seeing his father for 15 minutes. So he came a long way after, you know, a long time of not seeing his father for 15 minutes. So maybe a thawing relationship there slightly, but certainly things don't seem to be all back on track just yet. There is of course the opportunity for him to return for the Platinum Jubilee, but do you think he will? Well he did kind of mention that he was hoping that perhaps he could come back here. He wants to introduce his youngest child Lily Bet to the Queen. They have not yet met. And of course Archie's grown up a lot since they moved to America and he really wants the Queen to spend some time with his kids. So he did say they are trying to get back here but they are still working through those controversial discussions and lawsuits to do with what sort of security would be available for him if he were to return to the UK and what protection would be available to his family. April 21st which means it is the Queen's 96th birthday. Prince Harry kind of implied you said look you get to a certain age and you get a bit bored of birthdays. So what will she be doing to market today? Yes she does you know a lot of people might be thinking well the Queen's birthday is not April 21 it's in June when we all get a long weekend but her actual birthday as you say is April 21st and she does have a fairly quiet day each year she's actually and Sandering him this time round that is a special place for Prince Phillips for Prince Phillips so a lot of people have a lot of people have have a fairly quiet day each year. She's actually in Sandring him this time round. That is a special place for Prince Phillips so a lot of people have said it. You know it shows just how much she is missing him at the moment that she would go there to celebrate this birthday. There will be the the gun salute in Hyde Park which there is every year for her birthday but really she does spend it privately we're expecting that you know a new portrait will be released for those celebrations but really the big party is saved for June which this year will be a particularly big birthday celebration because it will coincide with this Platinum year celebration so it will be a very big party. New York correspondent Lisa Raimelis said thank you and hopefully the Queen can attend. Well I don't know she might have the mobility issues. Yeah but she might need protection. I mean how condescending? So a woman who's been serving for what 70 years? Yes. 70 years as Queen through umpting different wars and pandemics and umpting different prime ministers. Little jab but those still around her aspect. And she's saying she needs to be protected. How condescending? Clearly a jab at the people that he believes are, you know, the firm and making the decisions on her behalf. Do you want to walk the corgis, wouldn't she, on a birthday? I suppose so. She knows walking those corgis. Right. eight minutes away from seven o'clock now after the break. Imagine flying from Wellington to Blenham in 25 minutes for 25 bucks with no airport involved.

Now to some very, very exciting news, a $700 million investment deal is set to revolutionise travel in New Zealand. Ocean Flyer, a zero carbon sea glider, look at this, looks to be the way to sail or foil the seas in the future. Ocean Flyer CEO Shah Aslam is with us to explain more this morning fascinating pictures. Let's find out more about it. Welcome to the program. Thank you Ryan. Good morning. There's a prototype sitting behind you there. Describe what this thing is. Yes, so this is the prototype first to be unwell to New Zealand. It hasn't been unwell in the States yet. Essentially it's a sea glider which starts on its hull. As it speeds up, it lifts on the foils. And once it speeds up further, it rises about 10 meters above the surface of the water. And from there onwards applies at airplane light speeds. So pretty cool technologies. So it's like a low-flying carbon zero sea plane? Absolutely. It's fully sustainable, so no emissions and efficient flying altitude will be about 10 to 20 meters above the surface of the water. How many people can you get on board? The first model that we'll be receiving will have capacity for 12 passengers and the about surface of the water. How many people can you get on board? The first model that we'll be receiving will have capacity for 12 passengers and the second model will be able to accommodate up to 100 passengers. And how quickly could this thing get you from say, let's start for the Jaffas, from say Auckland to Waahiki Island? How quickly and cheaply? Awquen to Waheke you can be there and 12 minutes for just 12 bucks. 12 minutes for 12 bucks. 12 minutes for 12 bucks. Okay, what about if the seas are rough? I mean, because obviously you get one of the advantages, you avoid the airport, right? But are you, what about the rough seas? Well, this thing again, as I mentioned, it's not the capability to float between that 10 to 30 meter mark. So if the waves are high, if there's higher crosswinds, all it does is just rise as a bit further up. But all the elements of keeping it, you know, sustainable at that level are there. It's like a plane, which acts as a boat. What about another popular route into Ireland short, say Wellington to Blenham? How quickly and cost effectively could you do that? Well into to Blenham we can get it in 25 minutes only starting at $25 per seat. Is it safe? It's absolutely safe. The certification that's being granted will be under maritime, but the aircraft or the sea glider I should say is being built to the specifications of aircraft. So you've got aircraft level safety flying only 10 meters above the surface of water. So it's very safe and it's fully sustainable. It's an incredible piece of technology. So when is this likely to actually be ready for use on the season and partly in the skies in New Zealand? So it's expected to be having a service starting 2025 and hopefully we'll start seeing it in the recent waters from then. And which routes do you think will be the ones you target? I think I'll take your cue right now. I'll start with Auckland, Vahiti and Robinson Blenham. Brilliant. Thanks so much for your time this morning. Best of luck with this endeavor. It certainly does sound revolutionary. It looks at too. Shah Aslam with us, the Ocean Flyer CEO from Miami, Florida and the United States this morning. Pretty cool. Very cool. And we're the first in the world to see it. As he said, we're getting to see it before the states. And I feel like it could be quite a tourism pool. Yeah. You see pictures of that flying across the white matah. That would definitely make you want to come to New Zealand. Very cool. Now this is AM, it is 7 o'clock. to have your company this morning. Coming up, we're breaking ourselves for the highest inflation figure in 30 years, with new data released later this morning. So how is that going to impact your fresh produce bill?

We talked to fishing expert Matt Watson about his thoughts just before 730. Auckland's CED has taken a battering from COVID.

Inflation is expected to have hit a 30-year high when it's revealed later this morning. The consumer price index will be released by stats New Zealand today. With some experts predicting it'll go over 7%. The government is citing global factors such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine is the main factors for the surge. As living costs continue to soar, Act Leader David Seymour says the government should use tax cuts to bring relief for Kui families. Just under a turn has arrived in Tokyo ahead of her first meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister. The PM touched on early this morning and was greeted on the tarmac by a small welcoming party. She's taken her fourth COVID test of the trip, a PCR swab on arrival. Three members of her delegation tested positive for COVID earlier in the week. She'll meet with Prime Minister Fumiyokashida, her first meeting with him since he took off. He took office last year. Antipresents are not associated with long-term happiness according to a new study. The 10-year study compared the mental well-being of people prescribed anti-depressant medication with people who weren't on the drug. Clinical psychologist, Dougal Sutherland, says while medication can speed up the process, its long-term effectiveness is minimal. That after two years, people that were taking antidepressants are pretty much had the same results as people that didn't take antidepressants. We've known that antidepressants are sort of about 50-50 in terms of how effective they are for people anyway. The study also found antidepressants are less effective for men. The ones popular why we had a hot pools are making a comeback, with a side being bought. The study also found antidepressants are less effective for men. The ones popular why we had a hot pools are making a comeback with a side being bought after two years of abandonment. The complex closed its doors in February 2018 after the previous owners defaulted on their payments and walked away from the business. The park is currently undergoing a revamp with a $250 million plan to get the hydro slides, hot pools and day spa back up and running. The new owners hope to have the park back in action within the next couple of years. Russia has added fuel to fears of global conflict, testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile. It's being described as a warning to all who try to oppose Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin is also fighting an economic battle on home soil, as inflation in Russia hits its highest since early 2002, accelerating to more than 17 percent. Putin says the West has a lot to answer for and should be stopped. These were illegal restrictions imposed on our companies by foreign states. We know this.

The side we're due to take on the Western Force in this weekend's magic round, super round of Melbourne, but cases in the force camp means the game has been postponed. It's a cruel setback from Wana Pacifica who have already seen multiple fixtures this season resheduled with cases popping up in their own camp. The excitement is building for the Blackferns Sevens ahead of their first World Series game in more than 800 days. Before defending their Commonwealth games titled later this year, Corey Sweeney's side will play two world series competitions starting in Canada. Sweeney admits being sidelined due to COVID is being tough and the team can't wait to get back on tour. You know it hasn't been a whole lot to celebrate for the last two and a half years. Obviously the Olympics was really high for us but we've we haven't had any real international international competition other than that for two and a half years so the group is pumped they're really to go. The Langford 7's tournament in Canada gets underway next weekend. The Northern Stars have strung together back-to-back wins in the A&S Premiership edging the tactics 56 to 48 in Auckland. In the Stars first home game of the season captain, Meyer Wilson continued her impressive form under the hook, scoring 31 goals from 34 teams. Coach Kerry Will says it was a much needed win for the host to have been playing catch-up since the start of the season, with COVID-19 forcing games to be postponed. Yeah, it's good to have a little bit of momentum. Having those two games in a row has to have a little bit of momentum. Having those two games in a row has really been great for us and I think beating the tactics three in a row has really set us on the path to some good things ahead. That is the very latest from Newsehab. It is seven past seven. Thanks very much, Bernard Dean. Not sure it's looking like sea plane weather in Auckland this morning. William, where are you? And it seems to be looking a little bit grey. Yeah, Mel Morena, I'm down at the Queen's Wallford, but check that out there, there's a bit of hope there in the background, we've got a bit of sun, a sun, a bit of sun shining through those clouds right there, but it's here to the weather at your, at your, it's beautiful. Let's head to the weather at your at your... Oh! Check it out. It's beautiful. And the water is rippling really well. Check that out. Oh man, there's a bit of wind, but that wind is slightly warm. Yeah, so really good. We're just as we... just before we get to the weather, that, um, boat that's heading out there, I can't actually tell from this distance if it's a ferry or not, but can you imagine those sea gliders taking off from downtown Auckland, I mean I imagine there would have to be some maritime rules in place, but imagine those those sea gliders taking off from downtown Auckland and in just 12 minutes hitting Waikei Island. Yeah that sounds like something I want to be a part of ride and I think they used to do that over in Devonport as well. Oh they did have there actually used to be planes. Yeah. They're quite expensive though aren't they and I think that's the difference. So that used to be over there. Yeah that's the difference with these things is they're actually going to be relatively inexpensive. Who drives them though? Yeah it's going to definitely save us time in the long run. So, hey, let's hit the weather at your place. Myridean. Multiple weather warnings this morning to be aware of, orange heavy rain morning in Tasman, bulla, western and the orland regions with high rainfall expected along with thunderstorms and large amounts of surface water, heavy rain watches at Mount Taranaki, Richmond Range, parts of the Malbra Sounds, as well as the Otargan and Canabry Lakes District. Expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms. Now to the rest of your weather. A rainy day in the lower south with showers clearing in the morning but expected to return the afternoon or to Porti Dunedin 21 degrees and Manu Hericia that's Alexandra a high of 22. To the west coast you can expect rain with heavy falls and possible thunderstorms, Marfera Greymouth and Hukhaka both on 20 degrees. In Canabry and Malbrary and Malbry and Malbra and Malbry and Malbry and Malbry and Malber and Malout and Hukkahtika both on 20 degrees. In Canterbury and Malber much of the same few periods of showers and nor easterlies coming your way, or Totahich Christchurch on 26 degrees, Timaru, a high of 23. Some cloud cover in the lower north with norwesterly winds and afternoon showers coming through, De Fanganui Atara Atara T Wellington on 20 degrees and the Kapati Coast, 22. Now to the central plateau, you can expect isolated showers and cloud cover throughout the day, topo, 20 degrees and Fanganoi are high of 26. To the East Coast, expect a mainly fine day with scattered showers and northeastily winds, Tohanga on 22 degrees and Ahuridi Napier a high of 24. And to the top of our country Oltiro, expect a mostly cloudy day with afternoon showers and northeasterly winds, Thamiki Makoto, Auckland, 23 degrees and Thianga on 22. All righty, it hasn't rained yet, so I've been very lucky so far. And dress, it is surprisingly warmisingly warm in Auckland today. So very lucky. 95% humidity. William, thanks very much. We'll catch up with you a little later on. All right, it is now 10 after 7, and just a matter of hours will find out if predictions of the ugliest inflation number in more than 30 years ring true. The latest consumer price index is due out later this morning. Economists predict it's going to be grim. Already we know that fruit and veggies are up 18% in the year to March according to stats NZ but why? This morning we thought we talked to a grower and a seller to find out what's driving the price of your fruit and veg. We're joined first by a director of Woodhaven Gardens, Jay Clark. Jay, good morning. Good morning Ryan. Hey, thanks for being with us on the show. First of all, what are you grow? Jay? We grow 24 different crops, Ryan, so I'm not going to try and list them all in the brief time that we've got, but everything from lettuce, celery, broccoli, cabbage, past the radish in a whole lot in between.. in between. Okay, a lot of people watching this morning are looking at the price of their fruit and veg and they're not happy. What do you want to say to them? First of all, growers are experiencing unprecedented cost pressure in their businesses. Some of that's driven from international factors like the price of fertilizer has gone up over 300% the cost of fuel has gone up a couple of hundred percent. and then there's things like seed and freight that we have to acquire to get our products to market that are up sort of 30 or 40 percent. So cost pressure across the board is sort of out of control really. But then there are also some internally driven things that come from government policy as well. We've seen our labor cost rise by about 60 percent over the last three years and that's driven by minimum wage increases and constraints on our labour market with a governmental COVID policies and immigration settings. Just before you go on, when you say government imposed costs like the increases to the minimum wage etc, that cost is being passed on to the people who are buying it, right? Right? Well, we don't set a price, Ryan. We're price takers. So the retailers set the price that they're willing to acquire a product on on the day. And as a grower we have the choice to supply the market at that price or get the tractor out with a rotary hole and turn that product in. And I think New Zealanders would be shocked to get some money to we sell our products at a loss, just to get some money to go towards contributing to the next crop. So we're not sort of saying, right, it costs us X, so we're going to put on why markup. It doesn't work like that. The prices are rare that we receive are really set by the retailers. So how much are you doing that? Are you getting rid of product? Are you not able to sell it? I'm howing up iceberg lettuce by the hector every day at the moment because the price that the retailers are willing to pay for it is so far below our cost of production that we can't justify sending it to market. And that's a tragedy.i It's wasted food.. We don't want to see that happening. Jay, how squeezed are you? How under pressure are you? Well, the squeezes everywhere so that there's cost pressure and then there's also huge regulatory pressure Ryan which is driving some of this as well. We now require a resource consent to actually grow vegetables. We require resource consents to irrigate our vegetables. We require resource consent to wash our vegetables and we cannot get a resource consent for any of those activities despite being the only vegetable grower that we know of that's a balanced farm environment regional supreme award winner and also I think the only vegetable grower that's won the Horticulture New Zealand Environmental Awards so if we can't get resolts can see can do it who can? So Jay we're all looking at the cost of fruit and veggies and thinking well goodness where is this come from you're saying this is actually a storm that's been brewing for a while? Yeah this has been coming sort of for the last sort of five years rhyme where I think you may recall there was a report that W&Z put out from Deloitte, I think it was about 2017 that we're warned if the government didn't sort of change its policy framework we could see these sort of price levels hitting the shells for vegetables. So as cost pressures now and the difficulties of doing business increase for vegetable growers it was going to lead to higher price points for the consumer and now it's playing out. Just before we go to our retailer very quickly what's your message to the government about these costs and these regulations? Look we've been saying for ages you need to get alongside us develop a national food strategy that recognises the importance of domestic food production and heighten that the policy framework. So whether it's trying to access labour, whether it's trying to access irrigation water or just even be able to put vegetables in the ground that we actually have the ability to do that because I think New Zealand just would be shocked to know that in many regions it's actually illegal for us to plant new ground and vegetables. Jay, we're going to have to talk to you again this is truly bizarre. Thanks so much for your time. Keep doing the hard work we appreciate it. Jay Clark with us Director of Woodhaven Gardens this morning at quarter past seven. Now for the perspective of a grocer we're joined by simply fresh owner James McLean who is with us this morning. James good morning. Hi good morning. Hi good morning. Are you creaming it? Because Jay's not. Who's making money off these fruit and veggies? Not really. No. I wish I was creaming it. But no unfortunately not. I think you know when it's interesting to hear what he's had to say. I mean when we By our stuff, but mostly from the market sometimes from growers directly We really just look at what we can buy and then we You know market up accordingly and then you know use a sort of a gut field to to think what will what will a customer pay for for that thing? You know if it's a you know if it's a nicer looking collie flour or say they may pay a little bit more, if it's not so good, we might need to sell it quicker and, you know, just get our money back. That's probably the philosophy that we have. Yeah, so just for people who are watching this morning who are thinking either one of you as making super profits off these fruit and vegetable sales, I mean, you've seen actually tomatoes up 23% lead us up 52 grapes up 28. You're saying actually neither of you are making super profits because of this. Well yeah I mean I think the thing to consider about produce is that compared to other foodstuffs it's it's a it's still quite low value you know so if you talk about tomatoes at the moment at seven dollars a kilo you need to sell a lot of tomatoes to to be able to make a living out of it you know so yeah it's you know that's different from it's different from televisions or mobile phones absolutely is there a price because obviously in the same way that that Jay was you're restricted by market forces supply and demand so is there a price at which you know you won't be able to sell you know tomatoes or sell a lettuce? Yeah I think in the particularly the last quarter has been quite challenging because we've seen some unprecedented prices for some things you know and in some cases we do make a choice to say look we just won't have it in the shop because people will just freak out too much and say I'm not going to pay that and I'm never coming back to that store, you know. I mean I think that's been the real challenge for retailers in the last three or four months. James, are you noticing that people per person, they're buying less fresh fruit and veg per person because the prices are higher? No, I don't think... I mean, we're sort of relatively stable in terms of where we're looking year-on-year kind of thing. Yeah it's it is really difficult to tell just because the you know prices can fluctuate a lot in projects like I mean at the moment you know I was saying to your producer yesterday cauliflower if we if we roll back three weeks you know we were selling in cauliflower for eight dollars and this week we're selling it for three dollars and And that's just a product of, you know, if you listen to what the grower who was on before saying that sometimes I've just got to get rid of product to get some money in to pay to pay the bills. And sometimes that, you know, when there's a lot of product around in that supply and demand scenario, the price does swing dramatically in a very short time you know in one or one or two days so yeah I don't you look we haven't focused specifically on the volumes of people are buying mostly just what our sales lines does the t-shirts say I love strawberries does it I can't quite see the bottom of it I love simply fresh oh there we go that's probably a bit of marketing yeah James thanks so much for joining us this morning, mate. Really appreciate your time. Simply fresh owner. That's all right. James McLean, it is 19 minutes after 7. Interesting what the grower, Jay, was saying there about this price storm brewing for the last five years, which goes against what we're hearing that our problem with inflation is imported and due to COVID and the war on Ukraine. Hmm, it is, isn't it, 20 after 7? After the break, if you like to go fishing, there are new rules that will affect you. More on the plan to try and rebuild our fish stocks coming next.

New rules brought in to stop recreational fishes being from overfishing are being welcomed by most of the sector. Previously, only 43 of 1,000 fish species had limits. Now fishes will be restricted to bags of 20 or 30 depending on where you are. Now you'll know Matt Watson from the RTM Fishing Show and his own Ultimate Fishing YouTube channels which are hugely popular and he joins us on the program this morning. Good morning Matt, thanks for joining us. Tell me first your use of experience. What have you noticed in terms of fishing? Tell me first, your use of experience, what have you noticed in terms of fishing stocks? Are we dangerously low in some species? In some species, yes. But what we've also got to remember is that the marine ecosystem, they all sort of worked together and sometimes not in very obvious ways. So all of the species are equally important which is why the decision is a good one even though it's essentially stopping the exploitation of fish that traditionally haven't been important to a lot of redfishes simply because we've been spoiled for choice. Yeah because we are hearing that the reason why these daily bag limits have been brought in is because people are changing what they're catching and eating. Are you finding that? Yeah absolutely I think part of that is because in some areas the favourite table fish like Snapper had become harder to catch and part of it is because we've got a different mix of New Zealanders now with a different pellet. A lot of the species that we traditionally had that had individual bag limits on them were all the ones that were pretty much popular to your run-of-the-mill white folk really. I think it probably comes from the time when settlers came here and they decided to eat fish that were similar to the fish that they ate back in the homeland, very white-fleshed fish, but of course we've got a massive diverse variety of fish here. I mean me personally I'd rather, Mal Mal or Kahawai than Snapper. Well on the fish, I mean on the Snapper stocks that you mentioned too, I just want to bring up a survey from MPI because it found that among recreational fishes they were hauling in three times as many Snapper out of the inner golf than commercial fishes were. So we often think about commercial fishes as being the bad guys. Do recreational fishes need to take some responsibility here? Yeah, I'll address that, but we need to look at some of the facts behind those statistics, which are a little bit amusing, given that bottom trawling is banned in the inner golf. So, bottom trawling. So naturally, there's more recreational fishes catching sample here. Yeah, because so, because there's no commercial fishes, but very few commercial fishes, and the ones that are getting a few snappers by catch, because bottom trawling is still, the commercial industry's number one way of harvesting fish in this country, there's been outlawed in a lot of countries. So, um, it's non-selective, it's incredibly destructive and it ruins the habitat. So commercial fish is still the bad guys, you think? I'm not going to throw commercial fish under the bus and say they're bad guys. The men and women that are working out on the ocean love the ocean and to see as much as I do The system is geared towards shareholders making a profit Yeah, and when when people see those the fish and our beautiful treasured resource as dollar signs That's when it becomes bad and The control needs to go back into the hands of the people that care about it's I guess why these daily bag limits have been brought into place. Matt Watson, our fishing expert, thank you very much for joining us on the program this morning. Sorry we have to leave it here. 28 minutes after 7 o'clock now, lots still to come on the show. There's more crime and fewer people working in our cities and our CPDs. They're ghost towns. What can we do to get the central cities back? Stay with us. Don't call me son. You can do it from here.

One of our favorite things to do is to go on drives to the beach and just enjoy each other's company. If my grandma was to catch COVID-19, it'll honestly be heartbreaking. So we're doing all that we can to make sure that we protect them. We wear masks, we're boosted, and we limit going to social gatherings. We do it because we love her. Mottuilé. What's the only way?

Never looking down, I'm just an oral what's in front of me. No my hi my thanks for joining us on am this morning and thanks to our partners course as well it is time for the news. More in a good morning it's 732 economists are warning of the sharpest spike in inflation in 30 years with the consumer price index being released later this morning. Growers are warning the cost of vegetables will go up director of Woodhaven Gardens Jay Clark Clark told AM, they're facing unprecedented cost pressure trying to keep their businesses alive. The price of fertilizer has gone up over 300 percent, the cost of fuel has gone up a couple 100 percent, and then there's things like seed and freight that we have to acquire to get our products to market that are up sort of 30 or 40 percent. In breaking news around a thousand customers in Queenstown are without power this morning due to a lightning strike. Contractors Aurora are working to reconnect the CPD with power off in main streets like Ballerant Street and Frankton Road as well as the industrial area and at the medical centre. Anti-depressants are not associated with long-term happiness according to a new study. The 10-year study compared the mental well-being of people prescribed anti-depressant medication with people who weren't on the drug. Clinical psychologist Dool Southerland says while medication can speed up the process its long-term effectiveness is minimal. That after two years people that were taking antidepressants, people that were taking antidepressants are pretty much had the same results as people that didn't take antidepressants. We've known that antidepressants are sort of about 50-50 in terms of how effective they are for people anyway. The study also found antidepressants are less effective for men. The search for a fisherman missing in the Bay of Plenty is set to enter its fifth day. A Coast Guard plane will conduct an aerial search of the coast from Waihi Beach to the Motu Rivermuff as well as the outlying islands. The man failed to return home from a fishing trip at Torreira near a portiki on Sunday afternoon. Police is still urging members of the public to keep an eye out for key items of interest along the Bay of Plenty Shoreline. Europe is desperately trying to supply more aid to Ukraine as Marupol hangs on by a thread. Troops in the poor city have indicated that they won't survive the week. EU Council President Charles Michel has met Ukrainian President Vladimir Zolenski as the violence escalates. Zolenski says if Ukraine doesn't fall to Russia, he'll accept all the help he can get when rebuilding his country. Sanctions, weapons, membership in the European Union and money, things that we really need, things that we will for sure need after our victory to construct our country. new United Nations data indicates that more than 5 million people have now fled Ukraine, most leaving through EU borders like Poland. As more to Russian and Belarusian players will be barred from competing at Wimbledon this year due to the invasion of Ukraine. The All England Lawn Tennis Club said it had the responsibility to limit Russia's global global influence through the strongest means possible. The highest ranked players to be impacted are Men's World Number 2, Daniel Medvedev and Women's World Number 4 arena subalinka of Belarus. The long tennis associations ban on Russian and Belarusian tennis players extends to all UK grass court tournaments. Super rugby's magic round will be under the spotlight this weekend in Melbourne as the competition trials the format for the first time. The NRL has run a Magic Round for the past few seasons, but the concepts are first for Super Rugby. In New Zealand, Rugby's Chris Leindrum admits there going into the unknown, but expects the weekend to be a big success. Intention and hope of everybody is that it works and that it's something that we can pursue in the future. As I say, obviously it's been done in NRL but it's something that's pretty unique for rugby and if it works well and we can see promise for the future we'll do it again. It's the very latest from NewsHup, it's 24 minutes to 8. Thank you very much. Now you might have seen on the program just after 7 o'clock we spoke to Jay Clark who's our vegetable grower and he shocked I think a lot of our audience when he said this morning that he is hoeing up lettuce and throwing it away, hoeing up paddocks and throwing lettuce away. And lots of you have got feedback on it. What we're going to do is actually play you some of Jay's interview again very shortly and we will give your feedback on that interview as well. So stay tuned for that right now 24 away from 8 o'clock. Let's head to William, it looks like you found yourself some breakfast this morning. Yeah definitely more dinner, they'll rip again to the food here. I'm down at the Eco Matters bike hub. We're going to find out a bit more about it from Brent Bililby. He's the manager down here. So weather warnings this morning to be aware of, orange heavy rain morning in Tasman, Buller, Westland and Theodlin regions, with high rainfall expected, along with thunderstorms and large amounts of super-swater. Heavy rain watches in Mount Taranaki, Richmond Range, parts of mulberry sounds, as well as Otaga and Canterbury Lakes District, expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms now to the rest of your weather. A rainy day in the lower south was showers clearing in the morning, but expected to return in the afternoon. Otiporti Daneda 21 degrees and Manu Heirikia is Alexandra a high of 22. To the west coast you can also expect rain with heavy falls and possible thunderstorms, Marfera, gray mouth and hookitika, both on 20 degrees.

I'm just gonna, so I just get a high leg up. I'm here with the beautiful Brent Billby manager at Eco Matters Bike Hive, Bike Hub. Make, tell us about this, tell us about why we're here. Good, William. Well, look, essentially our bike hub is all about supporting more people in the community to be riding bikes. We know it's good to be riding bikes, it's good for your mental health, your physical health, it's good for the environment, it's good for your physical health, it's good for the mental health, your physical health, it's good for the environment, it's good for the economy. And the way we do that is we try and create welcoming and friendly places where you can come and get help and support to ride a bike. We advise you and help support you to fix up your bike, and help support you to fix up your bike, and we can help supply bikes and find community to support you to go riding. Okay, how do we get down here? People at home will be wanting to come down and see you, tell them how to do it, Matt. So this is our new one at Queen's Wharf. We've got sites in New Lynn, Henderson and Gleninus as well. Look us up on the web. Look us up on the web, we'll give you. for a bike, you come down and check us out and you can volunteer as well. So come and see. And it is the school holiday so it's a perfect opportunity to get the kids out, get them off the devices and get them on the bikes and you're navigating their way around. I'm not much of a bike rider but I might sink the teeth into it a little bit later but I'd appreciate your time late. And do you have an eco matters bike hub guys? Cheers William. Thanks very much. Looks comfortable on the bike doesn't he? It does, those flags are flying pretty ferociously in the background though, a bit of wind down there this morning. Coming up on the program we are going to get to more of your feedback especially about this grower. We can do that now. We're going to do it right now. Twenty away from eight because your feedback just does not wait here on here on AM. So what we're going to do first is just here from Jay Clark who's our vegetable growth. He's he grows 24 different types different varieties. We had him on the show earlier and we were asking him you know the price of fruit and veggies going up are you are you creaming it who's making money here. This is what he had to say. How much are you doing that? Are you you you know, getting rid of product? Are you not able to sell it? I'm hoeing up iceberg lettuce by the heked deer every day at the moment because the price that the retailers are willing to pay for it is so far below our cost of production that we can't justify sending in its market and that's a tragedy. It's wasted food. We don't want to see that happening. And the cost he says a big part of it is government regulation and increases to the minimum wage. And you know, this extra public holiday that everyone's talking about, it sounds great for workers, but that's a cost for business, close to half a billion dollars a year. So all of these things add up, right? Yeah, and also all the resource consents that they're having to try and get for just washing the vegetables, growing the vegetables. Let us know your opinion on that feedback at amshow.co.n.n. says... Was that a pun? Let us know. Very quickly, John says growers are getting around 18 cents for a piece of fruit for the last six months. Cost that much to pick it. he says, fruit being left on trees or falling onto the ground. Sue says, your backyard vegio gardens free. And lots of people saying that they were very interested in this interview with Jay, and they would like us to do more on it and talk to more growers. So we will promise to do that 18 away from eight. After the break, we're discussing the future of Auckland's CD will we ever see life return to the inner city. D I'm dancing with the Stars. Premier Sunday at 7 on 3 and 3 now. Hello old friend. Can we do this? Yes. Penn? Penn? Are you ready for me? Radio 9, 15, 18. Oh, so down, Sam. 22. Good lot of ticket I forgot to check.

Let's go! the USA is old but not every veteran that we support is is please give to you but not every veteran that we support is Please give generously to the Poppy appeal this April. The biggest kick I ever got was going to think of the crocodile rock. While the other kids are rocking around the park, he was hopping and bobbing to the crocodile rock well. The hookie, I know, welcome back thanks to being with us on A.N. this morning. You're listening to Crocked Old Rock by the one and only Alton John who 52 years ago today took the stage for the very first time as a solo artist. Let's take a look back at other events for this day in history 21st of April. On this day, 88 years ago today, the first apparent image of the Loch Ness monster was published in British newspapers and on this day six years ago music superstar Prince died of an accidental overdose at the age of 57. He's known for his bowling but on this day 1987 Sir Richard Hadley hit his highest test score of 151 not out and three years ago today Vladimir Zelensky claimed the Ukrainian presidency in a landslide election victory that was this day in history for the 21st of April. It's 13 minutes from 8. COVID has killed Auckland's CD and even as restrictions ease business has been quiet with office workers continuing to choose to work from home so is this the end of the CED as we know it to discuss I'm joined by Auckland Business Chamber CEO Michael Barnett and Jayal head of retail and Metro Néglis Patel thank you very much for being here nélish so you work in commercial real estate what we're seeing anecdoli and even if you just go for a walk in the city, is more for lease signs up. Is that playing out in the figures that you're seeing? Yeah, look, I think the current vacancy rate of CD retail proceeds around 13-14 percent, which is the highest seven being. The other issue, of course, is a lot of retailers that our position in the CDD have been trading at a loss and they're looking at their options post-legislate expiry so there are going to be a lot more issues coming towards the middle this year. Hopefully that will change. I'm a pretty optimistic person with retail in the CDD and I think you know with the tourists back in the city later this year and less restrictions with the orange light there will be a lot more sort of optimism further. But Michael you were saying that potentially there could be a lag and people wanting to get out of their lease because they're locked into contracts at the moment. So actually you think there might be more on the horizon. Yeah I would say that what's going to happen is with the employee and the employee there's going to be a hybrid model there's going to be a hybrid model, there's going to be more people working from home, the demand for office space is going to reduce. And I would predict that there'll, yes, there'll be a lag, but a year out from now, I would say the demand is going to be perhaps 30% less than what the demand is now. That's going to impact on leases, it's going to impact on values and so on. So I think it'll also impact on the sort of space that people want. You know, they won't want the cube farms that they've been in the past. They're going to want more space and as I say it's going to be a very different environment in in their CDD. So 30% demand for office space, is that equivalent to thousands fewer people working in the CPD? Yes it is. And it's, I think the working in the CED, the hybrid model, it will mean some people there, you know, for Monday, Wednesday, Friday, others there for Tuesday, whatever they sought out, there's going to be less people at any one time, but a similar volume moving through. But Neelish, are you finding that those shops are wanting to move more into the suburbs then, where people are presumably working from home? Yeah, I guess a move to the suburbs means cheaper rents. So a lot of operators that have been traditionally in the CED are looking at suburban areas to have their rents. They're looking at reduced footprints with regards to tendency sizes. So I think there will be a shift in the suburbs. But also with workers coming back into the city there will be more of a focus for the international retailers to come back into city at office. Right and tourism will bring that and eventually, when we finally hear, when cruise ships can come back, that might help Auckland's DVD. But this is not just an Auckland issue, is it? Because a lot of centres around New Zealand are looking at one-way traffic, pedestrianised areas. Are those kind of initiatives actually going to attract people back, Michael?. Are those kind of initiatives actually going to attract people back? Michael? I think that's what they're trying to do. They're trying to, you know, provide an environment that's going to have suburbs competing against suburbs as destinations for retail. That's going to happen and they're going to have to, you know, come up with something that's different, but they're also going to need to come up with something that's more accessible. So I think the competition is on. It's going to be interesting to see how the various malls and access into shopping areas changes. Let's have a look. We've got actually a live shot of the CPD now. So let's have a look at what's going on. I mean there are a few people out and about. Nelish though when you are talking to businesses who are looking to lease buildings, is transport a really significant part of that and people actually being able to know that they're going to have foot traffic? and are these pedestrianised plans and cutting car parks going to turn people off wanting to lease in the centre? Oh look I think with the CD and I'm a big advocate of less parking in the CD so obviously the other thing is the CRL that's definitely going to help so we're seeing a bit more demand towards the upper end of Queen Street now with the CRL in mind. Once the CRL is up and up and running you know a lot of retailers are told us that they want to be close to these in these stations and transport transport notes. there are I mean that there are told us that they want to be close to these stations and transport notes. There are, I mean that is an area where at least people can get to but you know there are areas in the CED where it's not so easy to access though right and and especially if we look outside of Auckland if you take car parks away from those centres it makes it really hard for people to get to those shops. Yeah I mean look in my view the CED thrives of tourism of tourism so once you got the people coming off those shops. Yeah, I mean, look, look, in my view, the CD thrives off tourism. So once you've got the people coming off the ships, you know, people taking public transport, coming off Brita Mart train station, that's really going to be the opportunity for retailers to thrive. Is it the silver bullet line? No, and in fact, I think the movement of parking, I don't mind if they're taking it away from outside the shop, but you've got to replace it and replace it nearby. Auckland isn't one of those places where you've got good public transport, easy access. And I don't believe there's any shopping centre around the Auckland region where you could look at and say, good access by motor car, is going to be one of the solutions. I think we need a balance. I don't think we should be removing it. Okay, well this is obviously an issue not just for Auckland but around the country, which we'll keep an eye on. Auckland Business Chamber CEO, CEO, Michael Barney and JEL, head of retail and metro Neelish Patel. Thank you both very much for being here.. Neelish Patel, thank you both very much for being here.

Morena welcome back to a.m. Wellington is hiding under that cloud today wet and windy it's taking 18 minutes from the airport into the city and 35 minutes from lower heart traffic updates thanks to our partner battery zone your local battery expert and it was not cloud but thunder that has apparently caused power outages in Queensland we go to our reporters right now and Mitch Redmond joins us first from Christchurch with the latest on Queenstown. Mitch, good morning. Yeah, good morning Ryan. Thousands of residents in and around Queenstown in the surrounding areas are without power this morning. After a lightning strike is said to have hit the grid exit point earlier on this morning. Now this outage is affecting Queenstown but also areas such as Frankton, Glenorkey and as far as Arrowtown as well. Waka Kortahi is also saying that traffic lights are out in the area so they're urging motorists to take some care when driving around Queenstown this morning. Queenstown Airport is also said to be affected by this power outage, so it really seems like it is covering a wide area. A roar energy who is in charge of power in the region says that workers are on the way to fix this power outage, but they're not able to give a time frame just yet on when the power will be back on. But there are reports of people saying that this thunder was shaking their entire home. So it certainly sounds like an eventable way to wake up this morning. And one person says that they don't wish to get out of their home because they haven't had their morning. Because they haven't had their morning coffee. Hopefully this power can get switched on pretty soon. If that's the worst of their worries, I think they're okay. But as you say, for the traffic lights and for the airport and the rest of these services and the city, quite important. We'll make sure that we keep up to date with us and keep you up to date with it as well. Thank you Mitch and Christchurch this morning. We've got obviously news shortly and then at half eight. Let's go to Auckland now and check in with Tear McDougal. Tear good morning. Good morning Ryan. The why do a wide the once North Island hotspot will be opening up again shortly. It's only 45 minutes out of Auckland and those thermal pools could be thriving once again. So two years ago the complex closed after previous owners defaulted on their payments which was disastrous for the small town that the pools were located in. But new affair new owners have a new $250 million plan to revamp the hydro slides, the hot pools and the day spa so no doubt you can catch me there when it's all up and running again. Sounds good, nothing like a day at why we're there. Thank you both so much for your reporting this morning this is AM and I tell you that in Queenstown a friend of mine has just text me and said it sounded like there were, thought there might have been a landslide or something, the echoing of the thunder around the hells, the lightning strikes etc. So loud they thought there must have been some kind of landslide happening. Wow if anyone caught that on camera on your phone or anything please let us know. Thanks for joining us just ahead. We addressed the biodiversity crisis in New Zealand. Where are all the birds going? And our daily panel is in. We've got former MP Paula Bennett and lawyer Chris Patterson. After 830 the planets are aligning literally once in a lifetime solar event is coming. You won't want to miss hearing about that. Now it's time for the news. More in a good morning it is one minute past date. All eyes will be on stats New Zealand today with the next inflation rate to be revealed later this morning. It's expected to hit a 30-year high with some experts predicting it'll go over 7% the owner of fruit and veggie shop simply fresh says as prices saw the retailers aren't making any profits of the inflated cost of goods. It's still quite low value, you know, so if you talk about tomatoes at the moment, at $7 a kilo you need to sell a lot of tomatoes to be able to make a living out of it. A major power outage is affecting large parts of Queenstown this morning. Around a thousand customers are starting the day in the dark after a lightning strike knocked off power in the central city just after seven. Key roads like Ballarat Street and Franklin Road as well as the industrial area and the medical centre are affected. Contractors are working to reconnect power by hopefully a quarter past 11 this morning. Marine conservation groups are welcoming the decision to introduce catch limits for all species of finfish. Despite there being around a thousand different breeds only 43 were being regulated, allowing some stocks to be overfished. Fishman Matt Watson says this decision is crucial to making sure that all of the marine ecosystem can continue to grow. All of the species are equally important which is why the decision is a good one even though it's essentially stopping the exploitation of fish that traditionally haven't been important to a lot of redfishes. A Russian ultimatum to Ukrainian troops and Maruyupol to surrender or die has expired. One of Ukraine's last holding grounds in the port city is the as-of-style steel plants where a fire has been burning for more than 24 hours. A commander of a unit inside the plant has released a video pleading for aid. He says he and his troops likely have just hours to live.

Four people are dead and 20 others are fighting for their lives following an explosion at a coal mine in Poland. A total of 42 miners were in the area at the time when an explosion had over a kilometre deep into the mine. a number of people remain unaccounted for. Early indicators suggest it may have been a methane explosion with local burn units, warning family members to expect the worst. This is a catastrophe. The rescue operation continues. We have nine patients already admitted and the tenth is in the emergency room. Everyone's conditions are very severe. Some won't make it. The Polish Prime Minister is expected to visit the area later today. In sport, the Blackferns Sevens are wary of their lack of game time ahead of their defending their Commonwealth games titled this year. The Olympic champions will join the World Series later this month in Canada with just two tournaments before the Birmingham Games. Stacey Flugler who can't wait to get back on tour admits they need all the exposure they can get. There's only two tournaments left for four Commonwealth games so we need as much exposure international exposure as we can. So we can train every single scenario that we can out on the field. There's so many different pictures that you get different oppositions have different game plans Kiwi fans wanting to watch the Blackferns defend the rugby world cup will be able to do for do so for free With TV 3 partnering with Spark sport for this year's tournament He had Spark sport Jeff Latch told a he's hoping the World Cup on home soil will be a monumental occasion for the Blackferns and the sport. If you think of the legacy of the Blackferns in their five World Cup victories, I mean what other sports team can talk about five World Cup victories? I mean it's just outstanding and if we can build on that legacy here in New Zealand the country embraces it I think is going to be a fantastic event. The Northern Stars have held on to claim their fourth win of the Ainsed Premiership season in their first home match of the year. A well-drilled side were pushed all the way by the tactics before the stars thrashed them in the fourth quarter to record a 56-48 victory. Captain Meyer Wilson continued her impressive form under the hoop scoring 31 goals from 34 10s, as the Northern has completed a clean sweep against the Cantabrians. Yeah, really stoked to finally be back at home. It feels like forever since we last played here so really happy with that. And considering that was a way better game from both sides than last Saturday when we played them so tickets came out to us and I'm really glad we stood our ground. Great game. that's the very latest from Newshub. It is six minutes past age. Thank you very much. There's some interesting stats that have just come out from Trade Me. They look at their property price index which looks at supply of property around the country and it's found record levels of supply all 15 regions, a record high in several regions, but despite the increase in supply the national average asking price has also reached a new record, 971,450, so that's up 21%. Yeah, so the problem is when you have lots of supply, not quite a glut, but when you have lots to supply and an asking price, whether they actually get that asking price is very different. Yeah the asking price. Different from the sale price. Exactly exactly right it is six minutes after eight now remember Snakes on a plane yeah great movie not so fun if it's snakes in a car while you're driving on a motorway take a look at this from the UK driving down the um5 when this happened. Oh yeah it's just a grass. Oh my goodness. I know. I know. Oh! Oh! a guy by the name of James Bristow and his son driving on the M5 in Staffordshire and this grass snake. Obviously they don't, you know, kill you. But ooh. Oh, no, have to get there. It's not like, you know, when a fly lands on your windscreen and you can just go try and get it off with the wipers. You can't exactly do that with a snake. I would just hate to think what would happen if that would happen if that went inside the vehicle? Oh yeah while you're driving? Yeah, oh no. It's disgusting. Let's head back to William now who looks like he's a bit of fun. How cool is that bike? Yeah, Lordana, hey guys and to you at home. Yeah this is the penny penny farthing I think it's cool but this is a little guy. you might be, his is bigger. So penny farthing I think it's cool, but this is a little guy. You might be, his is bigger. So he's a sprint champion on those bikes, so he's ridden that for a while. So we've been riding down here, but I want to get into that food though. It looks bloody delicious. But first, it's head to the weather. Around the motto. with high rainfall expected along with thunderstorms and large amounts of surface water, heavy rain watches in Mount Taranaki Richmond Range, parts of Volga Sounds, as well as the Otago and Canterbury Lakes District, expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms. Now to the rest of the year weather. A rainy down the lower south was showers clearing in the morning, but expected to return in the afternoon, Orte Bote de Niedenid and 21 degrees and Manu Herikia, Alexandra high of 22. To the west coast you can also expect rain with heavy force and possible thunderstorms, marfida gray mouth and hokitika both on 20 degrees. In Canberra, Moberm much of the same for you, periods of showers and nor easterlies are coming your way or to Tothahiji Christhets on 26 degrees and Timaru a high of 23. Some cloud cover in the lower north with north with northwesterly winds and afternoon showers coming through to Fonganiy Atara Wellington on 20 degrees and Karpati Coast 22. Now to the central plateau you can expect isolated showers and cloud cover throughout the day topu on 20 degrees and Fonganui a high of 26. To the east coast expect a mainly fine day with scattered showers and naw easterly winds, touranga on 22 degrees and Ahuridi Napia a high of 24. And to the top of our country, haulte a row. Expect the mostly cloudy day with afternoon showers and nor easterly winds, Dalmiki Makakkoto, Auckland, 23 degrees and Fittianga on 22. All right, I have to show you guys the jeweler, the tandem. I prefer where would you rather be? I'd probably like to be in front because you can do much of the controlling. And then, but I could go both ways to be honest. I think the back is the best because then if you do need to take a wee break, the person in the front can't, see you. You know? Yeah, that's a good point. I wonder if you can actually ride this on your own. to do it on your own but that's why we want you to try. I don't know. All right let's give it a go, let's give it a go. I have seen people do it before on their own. Just double the work. Here we go. Oh yeah you can. Yeah yeah! Now the trick would be... The luck is tough with the feeding the birds mate. The trick would be actually somebody running alongside and trying to jump on and join. How's he talking to the birds? Yeah it looks good. You can definitely talk guys. I want to ride my bicycle. You couldn't ride it from the back by yourself though could you? That would be tricky. Hey hang on that's a good point. Okay good experiment round and circles thanks very much really do you want to yeah can you try write it from the back seat as well go on go on oh no you know you know because there's no yeah you don't have the proper steering yeah no yeah okay good experiment round in circles thanks very very much, really. And that was fun. 11 minutes after 8 now, coming up after the break. We're talking at biodiversity crisis, the birds, chirping in the trees, why are there fewer of them, and how many will there be in the years to come? discussed this. tonight on three comedy night kicks off with seven days then tuck into the tastiest bits on best of the Graham Norton show and for a last minute laugh to finish off your Thursday check out live at the Apollo it's all year on three I'm Cam, I'm here to help. Last year we were called out to more than 400,000 emergencies and right now we're under more pressure than ever. We treated almost half a million people helping around one in ten New Zealanders. Sometimes people forget we're a charity and we need your help. So if life changes in an instant we can be there for you. It's all right mate. I used to put all my business admin into the too hard basket. My accountant did not like that. They told me to try zero. You should try zero. And now we don't put it off anymore. And you're making video use of this basket. Get your admin out of the too-high basket with zero. Yes we can, that's our most important journey here. Let's get some. Flights using sustainable aviation fuel will be departing sooner than you think. Tough high, but you're gonna need more than that. We'll be introducing electric planes on our domestic flights. That's impressive, but have you thought about hydrogen too? Yes, beyond 2030 hydrogen powered aircraft could be taking to our skies. Green hydrogen? Of course.. be taking to us guys. Green hydrogen? Of course. This is promising. Keep us updated. Your outdoor areas like a sanctuary. Outdoor heater $198. Landscape plants $7.30 each. Where you find a competitiveness lower price on the Sam stock trading, we'll beat it by 15%. Lowest prices are just the beginning. In financial news tonight we're seeing more New Zealanders. Bundling their home utilities with slingshot, saving money and record numbers. Booh. So, economically speaking, I... I promise you. funding up will keep more money in the pockets of hardworking New Zealanders. Starting today! But until I'm with Slingshard, save money. Boom! Jessica, in tover. favorite places.

Ah, the feeling of New Zealand's most trusted internet connection. Welcome back, this is A.M. It is just gone now quarter past eight. The government has announced an action plan to come and forget. Welcome back, this is A.M. It has just gone now a quarter past eight. The government has announced an action plan to address our biodiversity crisis. So what is the critical issue that the plan addresses and isn't enough we're joined now by Forest and Bird CEO Nikola Toki in fact it's her third day on the job welcome to the show and congratulations on your new gig I've been out of Mariyu and thank you very much it's been a busy week I bet it has and a big job as well because 4,000 of our native species are either threatened or at risk of extinction. That is 30% of our native species? Yeah, and of course it's all because here in New Zealand when New Zealand broke away from Gondwana, 80 million years ago, if you think about all the wildlife that kind of stayed here and evolved here, it became this life raft for nature right and it's like nothing else on the planet but and even though we've only been here for the last 800 or so years we've done a pretty good job at wiping it out so forest and birds pretty dedicated to making sure that a people know about this and b that we know we can all do stuff to protect it. Totally. If there were predators, just sticking with this, but if we had more predators, would a lot of these species be wiped out anyway? Yeah, so the biggest problem for New Zealand's natural fauna in particular is anything with four legs for antiques because we evolved as a land of birds, actually as a land of lizards and inverte, too, but which we often talk about a land of birds. And that means that as soon as things like rats, stoats, possums, ferrets, hedges, here, it just started unraveling the ability for these creatures to survive. Now, the good news about all this is that we know there's lots of people out there doing trapping, we know there's lots of landscape control. I think probably the biggest problem in terms of our biodiversity crisis is we haven't quite twig to the fact that it's a crisis yet. Even though we've been saying this, people will know that I've been saying this for years and years and years. Yes I know you have. I know you have. And the thing is the government says it too. And not only are they saying it, but they're now writing it down on a document I can barely hold in my hands, it's so heavy. And this document, just so we're clear, is I'll tell you, New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy, implementation plan. So presumably there was a plan that came before, and this is meant to be the implementation, but they've actually come up with a plan for implementation too. The problem I have with this is you've mentioned people who are out there trapping and they're doing good hard work and we know that it works. This is umptening different pages. I just want to read one of the this is one of the first objectives. Work with other system participants on continued system improvement to ensure close alignment between biose securityurity and biodeversity systems and effective biosecurity system is critical. Well of course it is. I mean what is this going to do Nicola? Yeah well I guess what I would say about the implementation plan is that there is one so that's quite a big deal. So often governments release strategies and give us kind of assurance as members of the public that you know we've got a strategy and therefore things will be fixed. This is a good start. It's sort of list stuff that's already being done. I would have described that paragraph as nature is in trouble. We need to do stuff quickly but I don't write those reports. But Nicola this is this is the thing right we have precious little time and precious precious little resource should we be wasting it and frankly half of this is a waste of time from bureaucrats in Wellington who should be out there trapping possums. Well I guess the thing that gives me hope is this so you know as I've mentioned I feel like a broken record in terms of the amount of times that I've come on the media and talked about, oh, we've got a biodiversity crisis. What actually gives me hope is a silver lining from the COVID-19 response. So if you think about our COVID-19 situation, we had a crisis, we were in trouble, all of the government levers and mechanisms and the rest of the community swung in to do something about it based on science and then we started to resolve it. We could do exactly the same thing for the biodiversity crisis and we have to because even if you're not a nature nerd like me or yourself, if we're not going to look after nature, the impacts of climate change in term, we're seeing almost every month in terms of severe flooding, severe rain events, big droughts, those get smoothed out by protecting nature. So if you're someone who wants to protect your economic well-being, then building and investing in nature ensures the resilience and the ongoing financial income for the country. I think what we really need to start doing in this country is starting to think about protecting nature as an investment not a cost. So if you think about it we often, oh then we gave this amount of money to a dog and we gave this amount of money to MFE. And we should be saying is... You're right we look at that as sunk money that we're thrown down a drain but as you say it is building a resource Nicola we have to leave it there unfortunately we haven't got as much time as they had pages but we will discuss this with you again another time I'm sure Nicola Toki with us this morning forest and bird new CEO it is 21 after 8. favorite native bird the um oh gosh I've just forgotten the big hawk that I loved on Bird of the Year.

Taking 27 minutes this morning from the airport to Albany. 40 minutes traffic updates thanks to our partner battery zone. Your local battery expert. Right. It is time for our panel of the day now with former National Party Deputy Leader Paula Bennet and lawyer Chris Paterson. Good morning to you, Bo. To your honor. We've been speaking earlier about the death of the CPD, but it's not just a lack of people around that is impacting businesses, it is crime. And one of the most shocking experiences they're having in crime is ramrays of people who are 11 12 years old ramming these shots with their cars. Pooler in your time and your work with the Justice you know do you have any ideas on how we stop this? I mean it is it's horrific and you know you can kind of see that young people there is a small proportion of them and I think we've got to keep that in perspective as well you know, most of our young people are going to lead the world and thank goodness and you know, and they're going to shine and be brighter and doing better than any of us, you know, and I just celebrate that. But there are a few that are completely out of control. And that's a lot to do with your upbringing. It's a lot to do with the lawlessness with the lawlessness. to take two frontline police, they do have ideas and they say they know who these kids are, they know the families they're in, they're visiting them, they're saying they can pick them up you know at 11 o'clock at night, take them home, knock on the door, talk to the parents, drive down the road and sit and wait and see the kids 10 minutes later going back out again to to steal cars and things like that. So police would say why don't we have a special law that is for an exceptional small proportion of young people that have done multiple crimes that means that we can do home detention, that means that we can actually have extra checks on them, that we can make sure that they're actually where they're supposed to be and not where they're not, and give them some extra powers for a very few select under a strict criteria. And I think it's time we looked at that. Chris, and your experience as a lawyer, would that work? Yeah, well look, I mean, I come to this not just as a lawyer, but also as a father of two teenage boys, 15 and 16-year-old. In fact, my 16-year-old has taken my Polarisalaris and used it to do an unsuccessful ram raid of a neighbour's property. So look, there's bigger issues here than just saying, hey let's go the quick solution, all respect to this polar, I think what the police are saying, great suggestions. But you've got to go further than that. It's always easy to say let's get hard on crime. Let's look more at what is actually underlying, you know, underlying all this. I mean, from my perspective, you know, you know that's being engaged in a new my perspective it's actually more of an issue of we need to get our teenagers engaged. They need to be engaged in positive community related matters. So that rather than sitting around with their mates bored wanting to get access to a bit of alcohol or whatever it is that's that's driving them at that moment at that moment. Because bearing in mind the teenage brain only thinks in just that moment. Is it boredom though that's driving them? I don't think I think it's more poverty surely. It's its lack of access. But regardless of what you're saying and I think we would all agree that that's a really good you know but in the meantime what you're just going to let these jewelry shops be you know pillaged every day? So when we're not in my case I'm not talking about those young people that are making silly decision you know and the spare of day? So we're not, in my case, I'm not talking about those. Young people that are making a silly decision, you know, in the spirit of the moment, or caught in it, or, you know, I think we do need more programs, I totally agree, we need better engagement, we need earlier interventions. I'm talking about an exceptional small number, that are consistently breaking the law, causing a huge amount of harm, is it before someone dies from one of these ram- consistently breaking the law causing a huge amount of harm. You know it's a matter of time isn't it before someone dies from one of these ramraids? Let's be honest. And for them I think there does have to be stronger consequences. Consequences on the blimmin parents too. You know actually you have a responsibility to know where your young person is. You know a 15 year old should not repeatedly be out on the street stealing cars and ramming. And that's what we're saying. You can't say that these days Paul, it not the parents. So hey and I've got to take a little bit of an issue with that again, you know, as a father of two teenage boys. There's only so much control that one can exercise. I mean I can't lock them up, like I can't lock them in a room from nine o'clock at night and say I'll let you out to go to school. That's because otherwise I'm going to get into trouble. Yeah, I think you want. And it doesn't work like that. Okay, well all you can do with a teenager is that you can give them opportunities, give them guidance and give them and really give them support. But if they want to break out of the house... And consequences for their actions, you know, Toe Chris. I tell you, Chris, I've had this discussion with police. I remember clearly and it wasn't that long, it was within a year sitting down in a police office up in Mangafai and saying to the local constable, look, you guys don't make my job as a parent any easier. Because what happens is, is that when our young people do something, there are no real consequences for them in their own minds. They don't see it as a consequence. We think we're doing the right thing but they don't look at it that way and it's and part of it is it's because the teenage brain it works in a certain way. They see things in nano seconds. I've had one. I know about it. Hey just before we got very quickly and we are it's 830 news. Sorry Bernie but very quickly national party up in the latest Curia poll and ahead of Labour, but also with women in particular. And this idea that women will vote for women, so you need a female leading. Obviously, Labour has a female leader, national doesn't. What does the say do you think about that notion? Well, women are going to vote for the best ideas. And we do like to see ourselves and different. What is the side do you think about that notion? Women are going to vote for the best ideas. And we do like to see a party that represents us and that we can see ourselves and different so we need more than this Christopher leading the national party, we need a team behind them, we need a team behind them when we want to see that. But I'm just excited because I just think we're going to have a contest of ideas. And that's what this morning. We society we want, what's important. Tonight we've had to this morning, sorry, we've just had a neat little debate, you know, let's actually have them wider and have a contest and I think that's what that poll is saying, bring it on. Yeah, absolutely. A very good concept. This system fails., we've got an opposition who can actually stand up to a government government. You know, because democracy only works that way. If you've got an ineffective opposition, the system fails. It doesn't work otherwise. And I think we're seeing that. Former National Party Deputy Leader Paula Bennett and lawyer Chris Patterson, thank you both very much for joining us on the panel this morning and let's get to Bernading with the news. Morning and good morning, it's just gone 830. Thousands are starting the day without power in Queenstown. after a lightning strike, not the city off the grid. A M reporter Mitch Redmond has the latest details. Much how bad is the situation there? Burne, residents are describing the thunder this morning as some of the loudest they have ever heard with reports of people's houses shaking. And one person even saying that they thought they were in a landslide. Now most parts of Queenstown and surrounding areas as you mentioned are affected and Aurora Energy is conducting work to try and get that power back on to potentially thousands of households that have been affected. Now Met Service has just posted that there has been around 300 strikes across the South Island in the past three hours and advising that there could be more on the way this afternoon. So for those Queenstown residents that had an early wake up this morning there could certainly be some tired eyes in and around the region this afternoon. Yes indeed thanks Mitch Redmond in Christchurch. Economists are warning of the sharper spike in inflation and 30 years ahead of the consumer price index being released later this morning. Growers are warning the cost of vegetables will go up. Director of Woodhaven Gardens, Jay Clark told at AM, they're facing unprecedented cost pressure trying to keep their businesses alive. The price of fertiliser has gone up over 300 percent. The cost of fuel is gone up a couple a hundred percent. And then there's things like seed and freight that we have to acquire to get our products to market that are up sort of 30 or 40%. Police have arrested and charged a 41-year-old man for suspected methamphetamine dealing near a school in Blenham. The arrest is the conclusion of three months of investigation into the alleged dealings. Police also seized cannabis and other drug utensils during the bust. Marine conservation groups are welcoming the decision to introduce catch limits for all species of thin fish. Despite there being around a thousand different breeds only 43 were being regulated allowing some stocks to be overfished. Fisherman Mac Watson says this decision is crucial to making sure that all of the the marine ecosystem can continue to grow. All of this species are equally important which is why the decision is a good one even though it's essentially stopping the exploitation of fish that traditionally haven't been important to a lot of redfishes. Russia has added fuel to fears of global conflict testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile. It's being described as a warning to wall who try to oppose Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. President of Vladimir Putin is also fighting an economic battle on home soil as inflation in Russia hits its highest since early 2002, accelerating to more than 17%. Putin says the West has a lot to answer for and should be stopped. These were illegal restrictions imposed on our companies by foreign states. We know this, and we're not just talking about the ban on exports, also the ban on imports of components of steel production like rolled products, steel sheets, fittings and so on. This breaches the World Trade Organization's principles. The Pentagon has responded to the missile test saying it was notified before Russia's routine launch. American rapper A. Sap Rocky has been arrested on an historic assault charge. The alleged non-fatal shooting took place in November last year in Hollywood. The 33-year-old musician whose real name is Rakeem Mayors fled from the scene. The Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment further. He and Global Pop Superstar Riana are expecting their first child later this year. The All- England Lawn Tennis Club saidbledon this year due to the invasion of Ukraine. The All England Lawn Tennis Club said it had a responsibility to limit Russia's global influence through the strongest means possible. The high-strank players to be impacted are men's world number two, Daniel Medvedev and women's world number four arena subalenka of Belarus. The Lawn Tennis Association's ban on Russian and Belarusian tennis players extends to all UK grass court tournaments. The Crusaders welcome back to all blacks ahead of this weekend's clash against the Rebels in Melbourne. After 12 months on the sidelines with a knee injury midfielder Jack Goodhew returns to start on the number 12 jersey with David have really being rested. Sam Whitelock makes a timely comeback to start at lock in the absence of Captain Scott Barrett who is suspended. Meanwhile, All Black's prop Joe Moody won't travel to Australia with a team as he undergoes further testing on his knee to determine his recovery time frame. A date has been locked in for the All Whites Intercontinental World Cup Low Off against Costa Rica., June 15th. That's when the New Zealand side will take on their Central American opponents where a win will book their spot at the World Cup and Qatar later this year. The victor of the playoff will enter group E which features four-time champions Germany. 2010 winners Spain and Japan. That's the very latest news hub. It is 23 minutes to 9.

Welcome back everyone great to have you watching this morning it's just on. Welcome back everyone great. Great to have you watching this morning it's just gone 16 minutes away from 9 o'clock. Very soon we're going to get our fitness on and Bernadine in particular is going to get her fitness on so stay tuned for that. Having got her consent for that I'm not sure what she is. A special event is taking place in our night skies and you don't need any fancy telescope equipment to see it just with your eyes. This month the five nearest planets to Earth have lined up and will remain so seemingly in perfect alignment. This picture here was taken from actually Les Mills in lower heart a photographer Marquis Porcetti who's online at Marquis media so that is a picture that's just been taken from lower heart and those planets there are labelled Saturn Mars Venus and Jupiter and Alignment how cool here to break it down for us is Auckland's Canc for Uranus. No it's behind you. Astronomy expert Josh Aulaki Josh! I'm nice to have you in this morning and nice to talk to someone who has more facts and probably maturity than us. If I had a dollar every time I had a Uranus joke so I'd be a very rich man. That's the key isn't it? Uranus. Uranus, yeah. And then after Uranaos, great god of the sky. Oh Uranus, ohranos, okay. Oh it's not so funny then. I know but yeah it's a good joke to me. Turn around and see your Uranos. So you can see these planets just with your naked eye. At what time? When is the best time to go on? Look. Yeah, so the best thing about planets and planetary alignments is planets, most of them, apart from Uranus and Neptune. You can see with the naked eye, so you don't need any special equipment. And these particular ones or this this alignment, is in the morning. So if you get up essentially just before sunrise, at about five, maybe at the earliest, you're going to get all four in a line. They're going to be rising, kind of as the sun comes up, and then you're going to be rising, kind of as the sun comes up, and then you watch them, and then you watch them, and then you watch as the sun comes up, and then you watch them, you watch them, you watch So these particular four are they're currently in the sky now essentially so they're going to be there for the next couple months. The one that we're missing though is Mercury. So Mercury is actually going to be there in kind of mid-June around the time of Matariki. Mercury is the one that's a little bit of the time of Matariki. Mercury is the one that's a little bit harder. That's a little bit harder. It's the one that's a little bit hard to spotter. Because. It's the one that's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's so close to the sun it's always moving. It's never really there, but if it is it's not there for long. But in about mid-June we're going to see Mercury and that's when you're going to get all five planets in a line. Cool. How do you know though when you're looking what is the difference between a planet and a star? Yeah, I mean a really easy rule of thumb is, planets, so they're quite, how do you know though when you're looking, what is the when you're looking, what is the difference between a planet's the difference between a planet's the difference, what is the difference, what is the difference, what is the difference, what is the difference, what is the difference, what is the difference, what is the difference, what is the difference, what is, what is, what is, what is the difference, a planet, what is, a planet, what is, what is the, what is, what is the, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, a planet, a planet, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, a, a, what is, a, what is, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, what is, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, are twinkling because they're emitting light that's, you know, breaking up through our atmosphere, but planets don't do that because they're reflecting light. So just an easy rule of thumb is if it's bright and it's not twinkling it's probably it's probably a planet. And if it's bigger is it closer, is it's not twinkling, it's probably a planet. And if it's bigger is it's bigger is it closer, is it closer, is it closer, is it's like Earth so it's not overly large. There's also planets like Jupiter which is really far away but it's so big that it's almost the same brightness as Venus. So it really just depends on the size of the planets and how close they are to us. And how close they are to each other? And how close to each other? Well, it's almost the same brightness as Venus. So it really just depends on the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size close to each other, that's just from our perspective. But you've got to remember the planets, they're separated by millions of kilometers. So they might appear close, but they're still, they're very far away from each other. And how often would this happen? Is this quite rare? Yeah, I mean, the thing about planetary alignments is they're not rare per se, but the rarity is more about how many planets we're seeing. an alignment of two planets, you might see that several times a year, three maybe once or twice, four maybe every year or two, but to get five that doesn't happen as often, it's pretty rare. So I think the last time I saw the five, I think it was about five, I think it was about five years ago. So yeah, very cool. Why so early in the morning, the planets happen to be in that area, but just because of orbital mechanics, some planets move quite slow. So they're not really racing around the sky, so we might actually see the alignments in the morning for several years to come, essentially. If you're up at 5, because of course you're going to be up to, you know, start watching a.m., you know, there's apps you can hold up and they can hold up and they that can help you to see it? Any apps? Yeah there's actually something really good you know there's apps you can hold up and they kind of you move your phone around. There's a really fantastic, there's one called Sky Guides, there's a free one called Star Walk which is a really fantastic which is a really fantastic, there's a really fantastic, there's a whole bunch of free ones. they're really useful for to actually for for for for that. They're a raki, whole bunch of free ones. They're really useful for actually just identifying what's in the sky. Oh, that's very cool. Auckland's stardome astronomy expert Josh Araki.

So, the warm-up, I mean, you know I'm always late to class always so every time by five minutes every time by five minute every time yeah yeah so so obviously I miss a bit of that warm up right but how important is a warm up why do we need to warm up how do you need to warm up is really simple is to prepare your body to move healthy and insecurity like to move way to do some gymnastic and stuff like that is very important to prepare your articulation to have a full range of motion without feeling any pain and just just to prepare your body clearly to to move. Do you need to warm up for everything like if you're going to run should you be stretching and warming up? Is it just for lifting weight? No, I won't say warm up for everything even for running even for for yoga class or whatever. It's good to prepare your hips to move, your knee to move, your ankle to prepare a movement, a range of motion, any impact sport or whatever. Yes. What are the common parts of the body that we don't warm up properly? Most of the time it's going to come from the lower body, we're going to come from the lower body, we're going to not warming up the hips too much, the knee too much, or the ankle too much, and what's what's going to move very slowly and it's not what we want for. That's my weak point isn't it? You say do you flex? You say do you flex? I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I don't think it's the only problem with you but yeah. What are the big points? What are the other problems? Oh is right and there's a lot. I think we call that softness. Softness! Being a bit soft, I'm joking. No, I'm joking. No, he's moving pretty well. No, I'm not. Go that late. I'm always late. I haven't been in how long. I haven't seen you for probably three or four weeks. Yeah. I don't even know why. I don't even know why..... I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm how to. I'm how to. I'm a. So you don't a. So you don't a. So you know. So you know. So you know. So you've been. So you've been.

And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And to go. Exactly. All right, so we're going to do some warmups, aren't we, so that we can give people an idea of how to warm up and how to stretch if they're going to be exercising. All right. So the problem is, the problem is, I want'm thinking, if I just do the warm-up, that might be enough. That's all you need. All right, well, we're going to do it. So, you've Bernardine obviously going to be involved here. Yes, I am. I'll commentate the whole thing. I'm taking this on taking this on. Chin in we're going to roll the spine step by step from your upper back to your low back if you can touch the floor is perfect if you can just bend your leg a little bit and you're going to roll your spine from your low back middle back upper back and open the tauracic we're going to repeat that two more time here's already okay. I'm lazy-chin. step by step roll roll if you can touch the floor amazing if you can't is all good roll just roll just roll if you can touch your floor amazing if you can't is all good roll just fine a drink I'm gonna get you over here next to Miller yeah of course all right it's quite hard to do this in heels yeah I can imagine I can imagine one more time yeah I'll actually can help you a little bit to have some range and roll again now very simple we can open the terrificic again great view and can I just ask why you're stretching and bending and stretching which is not at all together a hardship for me you know when Ryan has a cheap day is here weird that cheap day means a day not Monday to Friday not Monday to Friday no no yeah no Ryan this is amazing with all those stuff so guys you're gonna push your hips forward, keep your chest up, keep your chest up, keep your tum, we're just going to keep your chest up, keep your tummy tight. We're just going to hold up a second like that. You should feel a stretch on your hip flexes. And from there you're going to push your hips backward, then we're going to ask you to keep your chest up. And if you are really flexible, which is not my case, you can go as you can with a perfect spine here if we can. Then you're going to bring your knee again forward, forward. You should feel the stretch on your addict too as well a little bit. What is this music? I don't hear the music. You're going to push your eyes back on and try to keep your chest up and guys we can change sides. So exactly the same thing on the other side. How much should we be hurting Adrian? Because is it important to actually feel a little bit of pain? I don't want to say pain. you need to feel a stretch coming but if you start feeling pain it's probably a redish the range of motion. It's probably better than try to force it. So just this one is going to be for your arm straying a little bit more if you feel it that's perfect then you're going to push again. Ben you're having a good stretch there. yes I'm here. Yeah. You don't get a body like... you don't get a body like... you don't get here? Yes, what? You don't get my kind of stretching too. And you're going to push it back on? Bernie, you don't get a body like this doing something like that, all right? And guys you can relax, you can stand up. And we're going to do basically a squat, so... She was some hell over there, it's going to be amazing. We're going to finish it on the squat. with Adrian Roderadrin Rod Adrian Rodriguez here with us this morning who's taking us through. Thanks for watching everybody. We will see again tomorrow. And we'll finish on the squat. It's not a not hard people. I mean, why don't you like me? Why don't you like me? Why don't you want you to walk? Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's a small thing. Yeah. How can I help? How can I help it? How can I help? What you think? How my baby? You're my baby. Put on your brain. Oh."}
