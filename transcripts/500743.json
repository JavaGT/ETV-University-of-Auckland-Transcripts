For some, for a mother ma'amah maurie, who had tiped, the annie, a faircoe to her son the teacher had posted on an online cohort quiz and the question was whether a lad should be returned to MƒÅori which was a yes or no question. My son did feel really unsettled. He felt isolated in the class and he felt that he had to speak up for everybody for MƒÅori and take on that burden by himself. He didn't say who the school, but we've got to be together to meet with, we're not a minute, he, he, he hughkeye, he'll be a lot of knowledge bias and privilege in a loaded question as such, without offering any contextual understanding, it creates a completely unsafe environment for the few MƒÅori, my son included in their class.

The data data Waka-Kotash, there are 90s, in the year 2020. By the paung of the waterpiro to the aheing of the people, the take. If we were using interlocks effectively in New Zealand, and also bringing the number of roadside alcohol tests back up because they've dropped off in recent years, I would love to see us have less deaths than that 50 a year, which has been the lowest we've ever achieved before.
