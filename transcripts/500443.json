Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, kiyahua. Yes, I'm Rawritaio. I hail from the north. So I'm to acknowledge those at North Tech and working there. I work, as you know, in Wellington for Victoria University, but I live in Hamilton with my wife and four kids. And they're part of the reason this particular app Kura came into being. So because we're getting filmed, I must acknowledge my... Kura came into being. So because we're getting filmed, I must acknowledge my partner in crime, Tabitha McKenzie. If we had a hologram, she'd be here, but she's teaching at the moment. So Tabitha and I started on this development as part of a wider language program for Tereo Māori. So I want to acknowledge her, as well as the rest of our team that we have running and working in schools, total immersion schools across the country. What I'd like to do is to just try something with you it may not work but it's an afternoon and we're ahead of time I'll be ahead of time so we might be quick getting out of you but I'd like you to take a pen and a paper and I just need you to write these few phrases down I'm going to spell them for you. The first one, first word M-E-I-N-G-A. Spell that again. M-E-I-N-G-A. And I need you to write that again. M-E-I-N-G-A. And I need you to write that twice. Okay. So this isn't a test of your pronunciation. Don't freak out. But I want you to try to say meanga. Meanga. Go. And we run that together. It goes meanga, meanga, mea. Now we're in the north. It may not feel north because we're in Auckland. Depending if you talk to many Māori, you're already in the north. Some will say they're not north until you go past Fangarei. Meanga, meanga, it means is that so? Is that so? So it needs to be said with that sort of intonation. Meanga, mehanga, is that so? So let's try that, go. Okay, too much lunch. Next phrase, the letter E, new word, H-I-K-A. Eh-hika. E-hika. Say it? Eh-hika. Now that is far out. So we don't want a... We're looking for a... Eh-hika, far out. E- don't want a, eh haika. We're looking for a, eh haika, far out. Eihika, go. Oh, kapai. Now we're getting somewhere. So, we're going to, I've got a, hang on, let me go. We've got a magic coin. You pick heads or tails, please. He's, you've got heads. tails please. It's. You've got heads. One or two? Two. So this group here, you are on Eihika. So go, Eihika. And you are, of course, on meanga, mainga. Go. Right. The competence is your exepas. Who doesn't know what it is? You know, what, it's a quite. Otherwise, you'd know it by the end of the game. So these ideas, meanga, meanga, and erhika, all affirmations. And their affirmations used in Teoreo Māori to introduce language chunks to either speakers or non-speakers of Te-Raeo Māori. And we use these two, as well as a raft of others, as part of Kura. So Kura, some may know it as meaning school. This is our Kura, this is our school. It also means a kura is a cherished position. Or a taunga, a treasure. Kura also happens to be the middle name of Tabitha, Tabitha, Kura McKenzie. And so she believes, if she was here, Kira, Tabitha, watching online, she believes that, of course, the app was named after her. Mehanga, mehanga. But of course, it's a play on words. And it's a play on this idea that Kura is about school, it's about learning. Kura is also about a treasure. It's also about the language. But kura is also about people. And so the development of the Kura app came about through these key things, language, people and learning. As it says, I'm working as part of Tikura Māori and the Faculty of Education at Victoria University. And this particular development, ooh, I haven't got my clicker. Can someone flick onto the next one? I don't mind if you do it. What Kura sits in is a program. And it's a professional development program looking at language proficiency or supporting teachers within schools, Māori medium. Okay, so we work in the Far North, a group of schools in Fangarei on the east coast in Gisbon, central north through the Waiariqi, Rotorua region, and down in Wellington, delivering or working alongside teachers to improve language proficiency. That's the program where this kind of development came out of. We saw that the approach we were trying to do is have a blended approach. So we wanted people to be able to engage face-to-face online, but we also needed something else that engaged our participants so that they wanted to trial the new language, whether that's new vocab or new sentence structures, etc., etc. And so we positioned the development of the app called Kura. the development of the app called Kura. If we think about Te-Reo Māori and those who are proficient, we might think that a teacher working in a Māori medium school would be fluent in Te-Mauri. Because usually we would have a fluent speaker of English working in an English medium. Very general. And of course this isn't true so our target the people who we work with the diversity of language proficiency is huge we have people who are fluent in specific curriculum areas or learning areas and then we have people who are very good teachers, but do not have a language proficiency. And so our role, or the service that we've been contracted to, is to work with those people across the board. Huge challenge. A huge challenge. So Kura, the app we've developed, can be engaged on a number of proficiency platforms. Whether you're a new learner, or whether you're someone who can ramble on and on and knows their business within the Reo Māori, you can engage with the app. And for me, that's quite special. So the first driver is about the program. Where did this come from? We'll talk about the second driver in a moment. If we can flip to the next one, please. I just want to talk about the app now. A year ago, I was introduced to this word called gamification. Who knows what gamification is? We've got a few. Good, good. Okay, you can check me and see if I'm on the right track. But from what I know is, one of the things around gamification is that you've got a time, do you got to score a table, you know what you're doing, you can play against someone else or the computer, you can play against, I have a multiplayer platform and it's about that idea that was just spoken about before you're immersed in a game obviously we're not talking well in this particular case about the death and die stuff although it could be something in the next step so Kura essentially has the death and die stuff, although it could be something in the next step. So Kura essentially has five components. Punakupu talks about, oh sweet. Punekupu talks about building vocab. And if you're a language acquisition and that sort of thing, the idea of building a vocab and if you're a land to language acquisition and that sort of thing, the idea of building a vocab is important. We've got a sort of match where you test that idea of once you know the words, then you need to put those together. All right, you score points, you can play against others. If you get it wrong, your time gets shorter until eventually your time runs out. But still, it's around that idea of gamification. How it directly links to the program is that all of the words that are used and introduced in the new vocab How it directly links to the program is that all of the words that are used and introduced in the new vocab are also part of the vocab you learn in the game. So as I say, it sits within this program. And there are general knowledge questions as well, and then it's got my favourite. My favourite, because we started this when the World Cup was on, or planning, right drawing things about Tabith and I, what we wanted in a game. And so I put in a rugby game. And I could bore you and say, yes, it was well researched and blah, blah, but it wasn't really. It's just that I liked it. And my kids, I said, oh, what do you think about this? And they go, no, no, we don't like that, Dad. Okay, Kappa, change it around. What about this? Yeah, we love that, Dad. Love it, love it. Yes, I'll put that in. All right. And so a lot of things are hit and miss. All right? This is a hit. But we talked about it yesterday. Sometimes you've got to be steadfast and you've just got to get out and do it because we could have gone around and round circles trying to figure out what we needed to include, why should we, why it should be included, and we would have never produced anything. And at the time when this was being developed, there was nothing out there in Tereo Māori for our students. The only thing that was out there in Te-Mauri for our students. The only thing that was out there was a Te-Māori dictionary. That was the app. Put a word in and it would give you the word out. So while we've got a whole sector playing different games and whether they're the gamer, as we had previously, or whether they're similar to this, there was nothing in Tireo Māori. And so the challenge was to produce it. Make sense? Yeah? Manga, go. Oh, beat them. Eika, go. Yeah, far out, mana, mana. So the idea of an avatar, I'm not a gamer. I really don't have much experience with playing the old space invaders and that sort of stuff. And so when someone, when Tabitha said to me no we need to have an avatar and we need to be able to give the opportunity for students to build their avatar I just said no no no let's get rid of that I just want to play the game right how stupid I was oh I shouldn't have said that it's recorded now I didn't realize how much effort people put into building their characters. I didn't know enough about the gamer things that were happening and this idea of care. For me, oh, you've downloaded it, awesome. Kiwiwara, kiwiwara. So the idea of having an avatar, and of course we had to develop all the language to go with it. You know, avatar, what do we call avatar? So that's my word. Toy Kura. Toy, we heard from someone who, the arts, toy is the arts. Kura is a school or something cherished. So the avatar is your own character that you've bought about and have created in this world, which we call Kura. Okay, so So moving out. See if I'll give this word. There we go. So it was developed. But then what? Okay, we had it. And we heard today that access to the internet is no, you know, it's happening everywhere. And I was sitting there and I was thinking, oh I say something no no no there are parts in this beautiful country we call God saying that have no reception there's a little place called Hokieanga it's in the far north well actually it's probably not that far. And we go down, and I'm driving along. I'm lucky to land in Keri-Keri because of the flooding. I drive down, and I drive through Kaikohe, which is shutting down because of all the unemployment issues. And I go down to Hokkaangaanga and I drive into a gully and there is no reception and so the school we're working with one of the the Kura that we're working with that goes oh this is awesome this is awesome Rauri but actually we can't we can't get it because we can't even get reception we don't have anything here and I thought you're kidding me. My strategy is blown. So what we had to do was with the developer in Wellington, we had to look at multiple platforms. So we were able to do it both Apple, Google, and then we produced it on a disk. Of course, there are limits with the disk, you know, as you'd imagine. I don't have to talk about it. But it did solve a problem. We're able to get into those rural schools. And that was important because, again, they're part of our target. So the quantitative data surprised us. I mean we're developing this to work within a program with schools we are working with. For teachers but knowing that the teachers would introduce it to their classes and you know we get some sort of a flow-on effect. So I think to the beginning of this year, we've had those sort of downloads. Not huge, I would imagine, but I don't know what huge is. You know, anything more than 300 is pretty good because that's how many people we're working with at their particular time. So, you know, that's how many people we're working with at their particular time. So, you know, that's the way. And then we've, the spin-off, the spin-off was I was getting emails around the country from my colleagues and universities saying, oh, look, these people are talking to us about Kura over in Germany or overseas. And then it started to, you know, to sink in in terms of actually this can work. And I say it can work. I'm not saying it's worked because after seeing the, what are the hype cycle? The hype cycle this morning? Yeah. We launched it and we pumped our effort into it and it was like, manga, manga, hecka all together. And it was bumped. And then all of a sudden it was like, oh, then it kind of plateaued. And it went down and it went down. I didn't go down as far as the cycle set, thankfully. But now we're starting to see, okay, so what comes from that? What was our lessons learned? What do we learn from this development why is it important and we found that there are a whole lot of implementation opportunities that we didn't necessarily identify at that stage but we are developing and have developed some of those so making it go alongside a set of teacher notes. One of our biggest problems was that the teachers would say, okay, we've finished our work, take out your iPad or phone, and have a game, have play kura. And that's not really what we wanted. We wanted it to be part of their teaching and learning. And so we developed some programs that schools could use within particular age group classes, proficiency classes, so that it became a real part of the learning journey, not just there you go you finish five minutes early have a game of kura which was how it was being used so that was around the implementation someone spoke about Apple and and who's put an app up on Apple? Oh, you know, you'll feel my pain, hey, about how long that sort of process takes. And I'm not even wanting to kill anyone. All I'm wanting to do is to introduce an indigenous language on the platform that doesn't really have anything at the moment. But still, but still we get these questions. Whereas on Google, gee, it was up the, did it in the morning, it was up in the afternoon. You know, so lessons learnt around that. You just had to work on that process. I've heard that it takes some apps quite a long time to get the tick. We were quite lucky. It was a four-day, four-five-day turnaround, which I thought was pretty long. Everyone kept telling me, well, that was pretty long. Everyone kept telling me, it was pretty quick. I'm not sure what sort of time frame that sits with. So once it was up, we had issues of download. The app was so big because Tabithra and I wanted to put everything together. We thought, no, this is our one chance. It's our one chance, we're going to put it all together and we're going to put it out as a package. And so we found out that it took a long time to actually download. And then your strength of wireless and all that sort of thing came into it, which was no good for our kids in Hokuyanga or in although it wasn't too bad in Auckland. And I don't know, did you just download that? Although that wasn't too bad. So hopefully we've fixed those bugs. Yes. Ka'pa'a. Yeah, yeah, mea-mea-me-a-me-a-me-mang. Yes. Ka'pa'i. Yeah, yeah. Manga, mea, mea, mea. See, the idea I think... Yes, yeah, it's something we had to build in because we had people that wouldn't come up so they'd shelve it. So we wanted to put something in and said, please don't shelve it. Just hook up to Wi-Fi wherever you are and then it will eventually rain down upon you. Ejika, mea-ma-a-ma-a. And then what really happens in the class is that it has momentum for a short while. You know, a six-month period where things were working and within the schools we were starting to get some data of, oh, the five-year-old boys were starting to engage with one of the games. It wasn't the football game, but it was the match game, and they were competing against themselves, and they were playing those games and challenging each other. It was like, oh man, that's what existed. I told you that would work, Tabitha. But then, of course, if no one's driving it, it kind of falls off. And so that's kind of where we are now. We're trying to invigorate the market to get people to play it. And it's interesting in terms of we are focused on Māori medium schools. Now we're starting to... Vic Uni had a sort of open day for early childhood over the weekend just gone. And we were very pleased to hear that they'd loaded some of the... some iPads with the Kura app and they had a whole lot of early childhood teachers going in and playing it and engaging with it and giving positive feedback from the downloads that we tracked over the weekend some of those were hitting as well so it's it's i don't know how to do it but we do need to find a way of spreading the word and sharing the sharing the word of course we've got no money to do that. Marketing. Marketing. That's what they call it. No, I haven't got any money. Why? Because I've started on another one. But again, it's trying to support other resource developers that are working in Te-Reo Māi to take on board some of these. And when we look at opportunities that come from this, right at the beginning we thought all of the work we're doing here surely could support other indigenous languages. And so we started working with some of our colleagues in Pacific at the university to have a look at opportunities for that. We met with an Aboriginal group from Northern Territory, just to see if some of the things that we've learnt. I mean, the platform's there. The platforms there, it's about having a look at the content and inserting it. So the invitation is there. As I mentioned before, a more focused inclusion within the Tereo Māori program, not the after, when you finish, do this, but actually having it as part of it. The ultimate is to make a genuine teaching resource, that package. So then everyone across the country will be going, Oh, Kura app, kaha hiwara, ehika mainga, meanga. But again, that's... In Māori, they say, that's the vision on the horizon that we aim for. And so alongside that, we've developed, soon to be released. I need one of those banners coming your way soon. We'll be free again. It's called puna. Puna is a spring, water, a source. And so puna, and those are some shots in the corner, are targeting the new learner. Again, building vocab is important. One of the things we, both of our Tabitha's children and mine, they love playing on the iPad and writing. So we wanted to build it, develop an app along that line. So we started with that, to be able to write letters and listen to themselves, which is one thing that we couldn't, we didn't master within Kura. And that was the ability for people to take their own language from a particular tribe and put it into a game so that when they're playing it, their own language, their own language from a particular tribe and put it into a game so that when they're playing it, their own language would come back out of them. So I'm looking around the room and some of you may not know that the Reo Māori is quite diverse in terms of the tribal areas and some words that particular tribes like to use. And so when we're creating Kura and we said to them, oh listen, this is just a very generic and general language base for you. We got the, oh, it's not our language in there. And so it didn't matter how much, you know, have cup of teas and all that sort of thing. They still went, rauri, rawhi, we really love this idea. And they'd say to me, but can you do something specific to our reo? And so, puna is our first attempt that day. So for a range of pictures that we've supplied, but you can also take your own picture and upload that into the program, for the young emergent learner, we've developed a sort of tool where you can do the lettering. You've seen it in others. And so when you put the picture in, you type in what it is, it automatically brings up that lettering down the bottom so you can follow it. So you don't have to go and do everything else. It does it for you. You can also add your language to it and if you have a particular word for apple or orange which is different from another iwi instead of shutting down the game and not playing it and engaging with it you can put in your own word. And so when this comes out at the end of August 2014, we're expecting, yes, write that down, we're expecting just as positive, if not more positive feedback from our Iwi partners in terms of the ability for schools, for Kura, to be able to log in, to be able to put in their own pictures about their own mountains, their own rivers, their own canoe, their own marae and their kids to engage with them. Now, from a Māori perspective and from a Māori pedagogical perspective, the idea of knowing who I am and where I'm from are the two key areas. And so we're hoping that we've planned enough, right? It's got nothing to do with luck. We're hoping that we've planned enough, right? It's got nothing to do with luck. We're hoping that we planned enough to be able to deliver puna to the Māori medium sector but also to the world and for them to engage and to care about it. I love that. If you care about it. I love that. If you care about it, you're in there. And it's right then. That's correct. I support that. So, yeah, that's a good app. Kakuraina, it's a, back in the 80s, where I grew up, I'll school you. There was a phrase that said, come over here, bro, I'm going to school you. It means I'm going to teach you a lesson in basketball or kicking the football. And so we dragged that only because we can. Probably, you know, it doesn't resonate with anyone else. Obviously no one laughed. But it does with us and that's what matters. Kura's out there now, as I said again, free on both platforms. Puna will be out at the end of August. So, cana tenna, I think that's about it. Thank you to the organisers and to the hosts. It's awesome to be back again. Thank you to you, to a kauta. And so the competition is, we've got mangangang over here here and we've got Ehika over here and we're trying to get the revitalisation of the Reo Māori within this conference or something like that. Whatever whatever buys and resonates with you just hold onto that. So mana manga on three, one two, three. Ooh, just hold onto that. So, mana, manga, on three, one, two, three. Ooh, now we're talking, eh,hika on three. One, two, three. Eheka. Eheka, far out. It's awesome. Hope you enjoyed the presentation. Tena, kutu. Thank you. Tena, thank you. Thank you."}
