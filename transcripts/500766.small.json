The PM and Toyota have announced a major hydrogen-powered car scheme for Auckland. The Blackferns have a new person in charge, but he's not a replacement coach. And could this be the new way to get around New Zealand flying just above the waves? jump in the cost of living, but that doesn't make it any easier to face the highest inflation rate in 30 years. The Consumer Price Index today revealed the inflation rate for Kui households is at a whopping 6.9 percent, just shy of the 7 percent predicted. Political reporter Imagin-Wells has the details. It's the word dictating what comes out of your back pocket. Inflation. and today's latest consumer price index figures reveal it's now the highest it's been in three decades, at 6.9% which basically means what we already knew, everything's more expensive. Just like buying less stuff I don't need, feels gone up quite a bit, so we can't really get out and do anything anymore. I've got little kids so I can't, it's pretty hard to cut out things that they've got to eat. The average Kui household is going backwards. At some point they're going to have to spend less on certain goods and services to make sure that they can afford just their essentials. The biggest drivers, housing and transport, the price of petrels, balloon by 32% in the last year, building a new home costs an extra 18%. New Zealanders pay more for building materials in a similar way that we pay more for our groceries than many of the countries that we compare ourselves to. Speaking of groceries, we're paying 18% more for fruit and veg today than we were this time last year, and those growing them are also struggling. New Zealanders would be shocked to learn just how often we sell our products at a product at a loss. were this time last year and those growing them are also struggling. New Zealanders would be shocked to learn just how often we sell our products at a loss, just to get some money to go towards contributing to the next crop. But grossers say they're not reaping the profits, instead demand has decreased. We do make a choice to say, look, we just won't have it in the shop because people will just freak out too much and say I'm not going to pay that and I'm never coming back to that store. The finance minister continues to blame our inflation situation on overseas pressures not his own spending. You're thinking about the kinds of spending that a government might do that would be big enough to really have an impact on inflation. You're thinking about things like the wage subsidy scheme. Is that what people are saying we shouldn't have done? National suggests he treat next month's budget like Kiwi households are. Which is going through their expenses line by line and saying what can I afford to do now? What's getting a return? What's having a big difference? And cancel the stuff that's not doing that. There's no free lunch here. If people are saying that, if the National Party is saying that, what are they going to cut? Cuts to spending clearly off the table, but a cut to inflation is desperately needed. Okay Imogen, does anyone have any idea where inflation is going to go next? Well Grant Robertson is right, this inflation rate, the highest in a generation does boil down to offshore pressures. The pandemic supply chain issues and the war. Well Grant Robertson is right, this inflation rate, the highest in a generation, does boil down to offshore pressures, the pandemic, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine. And those are pressures that aren't going anywhere any time soon, which is why economists reckon things will get worse before they get better. Brad Olson reckons we will crack that 7% rate around the middle of this year. So the government will need to pull something out of the bag here to help Keyway's out. At this stage, the opposition is just ready to attack and things are only going to get worse in that situation as we get closer to Budget Day. It certainly seems that way. Thank you very much, Imogen, from Parliament. Hydrogen-powered cars are on their way to New Zealand. It was the Prime Minister's first announcement on arriving in Japan. The car sharing scheme in conjunction with Toyota will start in Auckland. Political reporter Amelia Wade has more. Justinder R Dern, the only tourist in Tokyo, hitting the city with a bang. COVID restrictions still strict here. Japan is one of the last countries to open up. The defense force plane last night touching down in Tokyo. The COVID restrictions kick in from the tarmac. Only those in the Prime Minister's bubble allowed off the plane for the official welcome. It's a reminder that this pandemic is not done with the world. Many countries still have significant restrictions. The delegation and press pack ushered in for saliva tests, lemons, vinegar and gurgins, inspiration to get the glands going. Everyone all clear. This morning, the promo PM back on duty. This is very literally the fruit of Kiwisis. Reunited with the kiwi fruit brothers and a high pressure calligraphy lesson, hence shaking. It's I'm concerned that perhaps this doesn't say kiwi fruit. Then heading to Tokyo Tower to piggyback Toyota's announcement of an Auckland green hydrogen powered car sharing scheme in a perspex COVID box. Japan and New Zealand are natural partners in renewable energy. The government's keen to drive up interest in hydrogen cars and the scheme will see a fleet of Toyota Mirai shared between eight companies. There's a petrol head myself. I've come to the reality that this is the technology that we will be using into the future. Hydrogen refueling refueling stations will also start popping up around the North Island. It will take some time. Infrastructure for New Zealanders will be at least five to ten years before it's readily available. Climate change will form a large part of Ardern's first meeting this evening with a Japanese counterpart the recently elected Prime Minister for Miyakisida. But as with so much of this trip, there's no avoiding talking about China and the war in Ukraine. We want de-escalation, we want diplomacy, and we want to see the following of the rules-based order. A very serious ending to a day which began with frolicing fruit. Amelia joins us now from Tokyo where Jacinda Arduin is about to head to Prime Minister Khashira's office. Amelia, what will they discuss? trade and tourism. But the Prime Ministers simply cannot ignore the global context of their meeting. As with every conversation, with every world's leader right now, Russia's invasion of Ukraine tops everything. And then because we're in the Asia region, China is also the topic duieu. The Indo-Pacific is coming under increasing pressure and specially in light of China signing its security deal with the Solomines, which means it could bring warships into our backyard. So the meeting tonight will be about making sure New Zealand and Japan are on the same page on key issues because it's becoming increasingly important to have as many friends as possible with us in the Asia Pacific. Amelia Tenacua. This could be the last appeal of our lives. Those are the words of a Ukrainian commander who's trapped in a city that's under fierce bombardment. Russia now controls most of the Dombas region in the east, in the port city of Muriapolas where some of the biggest assaults have been staged. Many of those soldiers and civilians remaining have hold up in a steel works as ITVs, Garrett Vincent reports. there will surely be a long dark chapter called Mariopol. And this is where the story of the battle will most likely come to an end. Russian state television flies a drone over the ruins of a steelworks on the edge of the city. The place where Ukrainian defenders are making their last stand. And from somewhere underneath the bombed-out workshops, one of their commanders says there'll be no surrender. This is our statement to the world. It may be our last statement. We might have only a few days or even hours left. The enemy's units are ten times larger than ours. They have supremacy in the air, artillery, and units that are dislocated on the ground, equipment, and tanks. We appeal to the world leaders to help us. There are hundreds of civilians, some of them families of the fighters, who've been hiding, trapped in the tunnels, underneath the factory. Food is short here now, but there's plenty of fear. We try not to be nervous, says this little girl, but when the shooting happens, everything around us shakes. Above ground, another Russian channel records soldiers getting closer to the victory they soon expect. They shout happy messages to their hometowns. And back in Moscow, their commander-in-chief celebrates the launch of a new intercontinental ballistic missile, an addition to Russia's nuclear arsenal with a flight path designed to evade all modern means of missile defence. A weapon which, says President Putin Putin will make those who threaten our country think twice. At a press conference in Kiev this evening, meanwhile, Ukraine's president made another plea to the rest of Europe for the heavy weaponry he needs to defend his cities. The Russian army says Mr Zolenski is blocking efforts to organize humanitarian corridors along which civilians might escape Mariopol. These buses sent to help with evacuation were parked up idle outside the city tonight. Its fall would be a strategic victory in this 21st century war but it's been achieved with some age-old tactics bombardment and siege. Russia will take its prize and Mariyupol has paid the terrible price. Police have just revealed more details about the moments leading up to the death of Chaos Prize. The 22 year old was shot by police in New Plymouth on Saturday. Layco joins us now. Layton, what more do we know about what happened that night? Well Laura Police have confirmed that Chaos Price did not have a gun on him when he was fatally shot five days ago. Police say that they were trying to pull over another vehicle when Chaos drove at the police car missed, did a U-turn and then rammed it off the road. His car was also damaged so police say he jumped out and tried to hijack a number of other cars and it was when he tried to take control of one that police shot and killed him. They haven't revealed how many bullets were fired at price, how many officers were involved or just how many people were caught up in the ordeal, but they do say the scene stretched two hundred and thirty meters down the road and involved around 15 other vehicles. Now Mardi party co-leader Debbie Nadi Nadiwapakka has been speaking with his fano who say that they still have questions, they want answered. There are stories and accountability that need to come out from this. So far, there's only been one story that has been coming out from the police and it has been very targeted at the final. Now police are still interviewing witnesses and the team leading that is a group from outside of Taranaki and as part of their investigation they are calling on the public with any information or any videos to please come forward. Layton thank you. A comment about disabled children may have severely damaged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's election campaign. He told an audience and the first leaders, that he is blessed not to have children with disabilities. Australia correspondent Emma Cropper reports. Two rivals entering the debating arena, a handshake, a friendly smile, an early one. Prime Minister won the toss... Scott Morrison opened the showdown against the Labour leader. So it is a choice between a stronger economy and a weaker economy. Anthony Albanese hitting straight back. They don't have a plan for the future.

The owners are seeking a new buyer or joint venture partner to turn the former water park into a wellness retreat. Githikhi Masalamini reports. In its heyday, why weirah was an Auckland hotspot? just such an attraction, you know, was the best hydroslides in the country, right? The hot pools bottling plant resort and campground were once owned by Russian oligarch Mikhail Kimmich. A major refurbishment of the pools were started but never finished and its doors were closed in 2018. Very sad for the people in why we're here because it's just been passed by. It's been reported Mikhail Kimitch died last month and current owners' urban partners are tasked with revitalizing the area. After sitting idle for four years, the properties will finally be advertised for potential buyers on Saturday. They're seeking expressions of interest from a wide range of people to either buy the land or develop it as a joint venture. It would seem a waste or a tragedy not to see that's unique thermal waters incorporated into an outcome there, whatever that looks like. Locals hope it will be a hub for the community as it once was. We'll sign at the end of the road that says like, you know, this is a place that you should stop at. So, yeah, getting it back to that would be great. If there was facilities for the people who live here You know if we can bring him to swimming lessons if we can stop in and actually have a part in the place that they're building But sellers colliers concedes the future of the land will be in the hands of its buyers what parties will bring to the site in terms of their vision. Whatever the vision, some are glad it'll be back in use. I'm glad somebody's doing it. It's doing something with it, to be quite honest. And hopefully, back to its former glory.

Yeah there were some big rainfall amounts especially in the South Island. Milford Sound received 225 millimetres over a 24 hour period. And with the high humidity air hanging around the country there is a risk of isolated downpaws for many regions with Northland, Auckland, Waikato and the Coromandel now in the firing line.

Prince Harry has been called delusional and patronising by royal commentators after he spoke out about his ties with his brother and father and said he wanted to make sure his grandmother is protected. He made the controversial comments after he and his wife secretly visited the Queen last week. Europe correspondent Lisa Ramer reports. Prince Harry Back doing Prince Harry Things, charming his way around the Invictus Games, championing causes close to his heart. And dropping bombshell details about the royal family to American TV hosts. You saw your grandmother how was that? It was great it was really nice to see her be able to see her in some element of privacy was was nice. It was a secret visit at the time the reason for it is now a deepening mystery. Prince Harry making the pointed remark that he wanted to make sure the Queen had the right people around her. She's not grateful and making sure that she's you know protected and got the right people. Well you make her laugh that's what she always says. But laughter is not the reaction the Duke's latest comments have received. The backlash has been faster than mix it was. You do wonder if he's just so deluded in his own Lala? This is the Queen, not just his little sister. Well, actually you're not around her. You're not protecting her because you left the royal family, so it's a bit rich. It can come across as a little bit patronizing. It's not known if the Duke of Sussex was talking about his family or their aides but while he spoke warmly about his grandmother. We have a really special relationship we talk about things that she can't talk about with anybody else. He had very little to say about Prince William or Prince Charles. Do you miss your brother your dad? I mean I'm for me at the moment I'm here focus on these guys and these families and giving everything like 100% to them to make sure that they have their experience of a lifetime. That's my focus here and then when I leave here I get back and my focus is my family who I miss massively. His family that is in St Barbara. Home for me now is for the time being. It's in the states. And it really, and it feels that way as well. And while he's not ruling out of family reunion at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, the legal battle continues for better security for his wife and children, if they were, to visit the UK. Do you think you'll come? I don't know yet. There's lots of things with security issues and everything else, so this is what I'm trying to do, trying to make it possible, but I can get my kids to meet. Their great-grandmother turns 96 today and will celebrate privately in Sandringham. What do you get the Queen for her birthday? More family drama, she'd likely rather have been kept under Rabs. The said, it's actually the Queen's birthday tonight, so what celebrations are planned? Yes, there will be a 41 gun salute at Hyde Park, that is the traditional celebration on her birthday every year, and an official photograph has been released to mark the milestone. But the Queen herself will be keeping a very low profile today as she has been in recent months because of those mobility issues she's been dealing with. It's understood she'll spend a quiet day with family and friends it's sandering him and no doubt Prince Harry's interview will be a top topic of conversation over the birthday cups of tea. Buckingham Palace is yet to address the comments made in the interview but Downing Street has been among those to hit out at the Duke saying that despite his claims they are confident the Queen has all of the right people and protection around her. The Duke's people were also asked whether or not they could elaborate on Prince Harry's comments and explain what on earth he meant by them they declined. The set raima in London thank you. A storm that cut power to thousands of Queenstown residents this morning has also washed out a section of the road to Glenorchy. Aurora Energy says its Frankton substation was struck by lightning, causing widespread power cuts throughout the region. More than 12,000 residents lost power, but it was restored by midday. Heavy rain also caused a slip to come down blocking the Glenorkey Queenstown Road. Well Nikki's in shortly with sport and Wayne Smith is taking the reins of the Blackferns.

The machine was bought thanks to a one and a half million dollar grant from the Ministry of Environment. New Zealand has recycled less than 2% of its e-waste. Sadly New Zealand's waste recycling is pretty poor compared with some of the European countries and even Australia and to catch up we've got to invest in some of this key infrastructure. The Blue Box will more than triple the capacity of one of Auckland's largest plants. The production company in charge of the film set where actor Alec Baldwin fatally shot a cinematographer has been hit with the maximum fine possible. The 206, thousand dollar penalty followed a six-month investigation which found the tragic accident would never have happened if the movie company had followed national film industry standards for firearm safety. The government has named nine places in New Zealand that will become the pilot centres for the reorganised health system. Eventually there will be 80 of the hubs making localized decisions about local health services. Juliet Speedy reports. The government says this radical overhaul of the health system will move it from being the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. We spent many many years putting a lot of money into the very expensive end of health which is fixing people up, much less in doing the preventive stuff. Overflowing emergency departments, long surgical wait lists and deep-seated inequities have prompted this major shake-up. The biggest change in the generation to the way our health services run. In the overhaul DHBs will be scrapped and replaced by Health New Zealand. It will work alongside a Maori Health Authority with its own spending power and a new public health authority to centralise public health work. Nine health localities are now being trialed. These are in areas including Pori Rua, Ottawa and the West Coast. But within two years there will be 60 to 80 localities around the country in the enjoyable These are in areas including Pori Rua, Autara and the West Coast. But within two years there will be 60 to 80 localities around the country and their job will be to provide local advice on health gaps and needs to the national authorities. We're going to spend half a billion dollars with management consultants. The government says Maori Health and Equity has been a major driver in this health reform process, but the opposition says having a co-governance structure isn't the answer and if elected they would scrap having a separate Mari health authority instead absorbing it into one. Krista Fluxen says the new structure will simply lead to massive bureaucracy with no better health outcomes. My view is creating a health New Zealand mega authority and mega bureaucracy for a government that's already added 14,000 more bureaucrats at $2 billion and yet we haven't got better health. That need for better health is the one thing they all agree on. Duleets Bedi, New Tub. A YouTuber has lost his pilot's licence after US authorities ruled he deliberately crashed crashed his own plane to get more views online. Trevor Jacob, a former Winter Olympian, uploaded this video to YouTube late last year. He claimed his engine cut out over a forest in California and he had to parachute to safety leaving his plane to crash land. Jacob walked to safety but suspicions were raised almost immediately. Not least by the fact he was wearing a parachute in the cockpit. The Federal Aviation Authority found there was nothing wrong with the plane and Jacob had staged the stunt...... The Federal Aviation Authority found there was nothing wrong with the plane and Jacob had staged the stunt. Well, coming up, could we soon be zipping around New Zealand by flying bows?

Farmers, your department store. It's a job Wayne Smith never thought he'd be taking on at the stage of his career. He's now overseeing the Blackfoons less than six months out from their World Cup defense on home soil. The appointment comes after Glenn Moore's shock resignation over the weekend. Smith has a fancy title, but as Gordon Finlayter reports, it may as well be, head coach. This is the new Blackfoons director of rugby, but don't read too far into Wayne Smith's job description. People are always writing about when I was a head coach and when I was an assistant coach. I've never felt like an assistant coach. Job titles aren't important, but a World Cup title is. I think we're going to go well at the World Cup, but we're not going to go well today. With the World Cup kicking off here in New Zealand in less than six months, it's going to be tough. The side will win list on the unimpressive Northern Hemisphere tour last year. Too easy. Too easy for France. Well it'd be my biggest challenge ever. I've had some big ones. Not all successful either. Like his time in charge of the All Blacks, but it's his roles as an assistant for the World Cup victories in 2011 and 2015, which propelled him to coaching royalty. You know, he's known as a professor, and for me as an experienced power, I'm just really eager to get what's up there. The appointment comes just days after Glenn Moore resigned in the wake of a scathing review into the team's culture. Smith will have plenty of support with a familiar name by his side, Whitney Hansen, the daughter of Steve Hansen, she'll do the same as dad. She's highly thought of within the group both by players and coaches. This is a step up for her and so she's going to be in charge of the forwards with Mike Cron. Yes, Mike Cron, the former All-Black scrum coach. Sir Graham Henry will also be involved as a selector and mentor, giving it somewhat of an All-Black's Old Boys' field. I applied for the pension two days ago. So... Before he's relying on that, it's hoped he can guide the Blackferns, the same way he did with the all blacks. Gordon, Finn later, New South. And three, in partnership with Spark Sport will be the exclusive free-to-air channel for the World Cup. Can't wait for that, and it kicks off on October the 8th. Well, crunch talks are underway among the Super Rugby hierarchy in Melbourne, with the competition said to move to an independent form of governance, as waning interest forces rugby bosses to think differently. News Cup can reveal all 12 franchise CEOs, as well as New Zealand rugby and rugby Australia are meeting ahead of this week's super round. Well rugby reporter Ollie Ritchie joins us now from Melbourne, Ollie, what does this mean for for the competition? Well it puts it in a very safe pair of hands to start with Nikki. Your board whose sole responsibility is making Super Rugby the best possible competition it can be. At the moment you have New Zealand rugby and rugby Australia who help oversee it but they really have to look at Super Rugby through a wider rugby lens due to their ongoing responsibilities and obligations to world rugby. You bring in independent governance, it becomes about doing the best thing for super rugby and only super rugby. It's the sort of thinking super rugby has long been in need of and one competition bosses hope it will spur fan engagement. It can be a really powerful vehicle to not only support rugby in this part of the world and advertise it and sort of showcase the best possible talent, but also bring together our wider region as a Pacific. It's those sort of concepts that yet to be formed super rugby board will be tasked with driving as it prepares to take over the running of the competition. It's how we best serve, I guess, having that independence of thought and diversity around our governance and the best possible skill sets that contribute to a great competition, but allowing them to fit in with our broader system of our national union organisations as well and the obligations we have there. We've got to be able to put a structure around the comp that's going to allow it to grow and to thrive. Super Rugby Pacific is currently run by what's called the Competitions Committee which was hastily arranged in the wake of South Africa's departure which saw Sandzar's reign in charge end. It's hoped the formation of an independent board to govern the competition will not only drive interest but also remove any conjecture around areas such as all black enforced rest weeks. The National unions naturally you know want their national teams like the all blacks and the wallabies to be successful, but sometimes that can be in a little conflict with the super rugby. Newseub understands the new concept was very much driven by the players and it's one they want to see continue to develop. I think it's just like a real cool concept just to really build and grow the game, not just like won't happen just in Australia and Australia, New Zealand and so yeah it'll be awesome. Administrators hoping more concepts like this can drive fans back into the stands. All right Ollie not quite a full super round with the postponement of the force Moana Pacifica clash is that match likely to be made up? Yeah Moana Pacifica just can't catch a break in Super A B candidate. Is that match likely to probably be pushed back toward the end of this competition if they can make it up. It's not as easy as just flying a team up to Auckland like they've done with their makeup games so far. This is Auckland and Perth that isn't easy, but they will get it down. The integrity of this competition relies on it. Ollie Ritchie, thank you. Meanwhile, Blue's first five Boden Barrett's excited about the prospect of running alongside Roger Tui Vasas Shek. The pair have been named to start as a 10-12 combination for the first time in Saturday's match against the Fijian drua in Melbourne. His physical attributes are freakish-like. I've seen him do things that I haven't seen before on the field, one-on-one's and things like that, but I've been really impressed with his professionalism and the questions he asked and how much he actually knows about Foti. With regular skipper, Dalton Papalee on the All-Blacks Rest Week, Barrett will captain the sight. Former Kiwi's half-back Tamare Martin admits it's still a surreal feeling on the eve of his return to the NRL. Martin hasn't played first grade since 2019 when a small bleed on his brain forced him into an early retirement. Now, cleared to play, Martin will run out at full back for the Brisbane Broncos tomorrow night as his remarkable story comes full circle. James Regan has more. Tamari Martin was taking it all in at training, knowing he's on the cusp of an incredible comeback. Just all excited now, I feel pretty ready, pretty ready, even though I've been up for two and a bit years. Partway through 2019, one of the game's rising stars was stopped in his tracks. He started getting headaches one week. It just didn't really really go away. I remember throughout the game just pummeling in the warm-up, sort of doing shoulder stuff, and my head was just crazy, so. The next, it turned out to be a bleed on the brain. He made his way back to club league in New Zealand, and the Brisbane Bron Broncos soon came calling. Yeah it's all a bit surrealist, everything's happening pretty quick. Particularly like what he's been doing here at training, the other boys from the NRL side often tell us how hard he is to defend against so with his array of skills so that's part of the reason why he's playing you know tomorrow night. T'amare Martin has scored a grand final try. Now all that's left to do is lace up the boots. I'm just looking forward to getting out there tomorrow and ripping him with the boys. After all Tamari Martin's been through, you can understand why James Regan, New Sub. wonderful story. Well, he's one of New Zealand's heavy-weight grades and tomorrow David Tua will fly to Los Angeles where he will be inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Known for his formidable punching power and devastating left hook, the tour man knocked out 16 opponents in the first round but is often remembered for his 12-round title fight lost to world champion Lennox Lewis in 2000. the 49-year-old says he's grateful and humble to receive this honour. I would like to thank the public of New Zealand for their support from day one. To be quite honest I couldn't have gone as far and I couldn't have accomplished a lot of things that I have in a sport that weren't for your support. A two-year delay due to COVID means the two a man will be inducted alongside several of World Boxing's biggest names, including Sugar Ray Leonard. And meanwhile another Kiwi heavyweight, Joseph Parker, is only a Dylan White injury away from a heavyweight title bout against Tyson Fury. The Gypsy King has confirmed Parker is on standby as a replacement for White should he be unable to take the ring for the WBC Heavyweight Showdown at London's Wembley Stadium on Sunday. Dylan White don't fight. I don't want no rookie bomb. I want a top five man. I've stated it. and that's it. rookie bomb I want a top five man I've stated it I'm not set. Parker has been a fury sparring partner leading up to the bout. I'm gonna say that's a pretty big ask though going from sparring partner to title fight opponent good luck to him. Although the money would be pretty good I imagine. Thanks very much Nikki. A Ki-we company is raising money to invest in what it believes will be a revolutionary new form of passenger transport for New Zealanders. It's an electric-powered flying boat that flies just meters above the sea, providing a kind of maritime bus service. Shennud Stull explains. The future is here. Gas guzzling planes and ferries are out and zero emission high-speed sea planes are in. It's like a plane which acts as a boat. Ocean Flyer CEO Shah Islam made the announcement at a conference in Miami today. The company has signed a $700 million deal to buy 25 electric sea gliders with plans to have them in the water in 2025. The first model that we'll be receiving will have capacity for 12 passengers and the second model will be able to accommodate up to 100 passengers. The sea planes begin the journey floating in the water before accelerating onto foils and flying between 10 and 20 meters above the water at speeds of hundreds of kilometers an hour. But will people actually trust the technology? Yeah, I think it would be quite cool. So it would be good to give it a train? Well, I'm scared of flying so no wouldn't. I would love to fly an electric sea plane. The company has so far proposed routes like Wellington to Christchurch in an hour from $60 a seat. Auckland to Waike in just 12 minutes, costing $12 per person and Wellington to Blenham in 25 minutes from $25. The company says it wants to service the majority of our coastal destinations, including places that are currently underserved. The first prototype will be on the water in the US this week, and Ocean Flyer has given itself three years to be skimming the waters around New Zealand. Shannon Redstool News Hub. The Sydney repairman, who found himself in a spot of trouble, has a dog named spot to thank for getting him out of it. The man was working on a septic tank when he fell in. He was stuck upside down with the water level rising. Luckily, local dog Spot heard the man's cries for help, prompting his owner to call emergency services. The spot was locked inside and... Yeah, he was doing this basically. And yeah, he was just going crazy. Rescue workers took 40 minutes to free the man who had minor head injuries, but it's fair to say spot was the real hero of the day. Well, these are our top stories tonight. The consumer price index today revealed the inflation rate for Kiwi households is at 6.9 percent, the highest in 30 years. Among the biggest drivers are housing, transport and of course the price of petrol. The Prime Minister says a hydrogen-powered car sharing scheme is on its way for Auckland. Just under Adun made the announcement during her visit to Japan. It's part of a partnership with car maker Toyota. And police have revealed Chaos Price was not armed when they fatally shot him in New Plymouth on Saturday. The 22-year-old had earlier rammed a police car and was shot as he tried to steal another vehicle driven by a member of the public. Coming up news hub weather and it's set to be a wet night heather. Yeah, tonight and tomorrow with heavy rain warnings and watches for northern and western parts of the South Island, Mount, Taranaki and also parts of Northland, Auckland, Wycato and the Coromandel. But after tomorrow we get a break with a fine start to the long weekend. I'll have your full forecast next and then the project's chatting to a deer deer deer.
