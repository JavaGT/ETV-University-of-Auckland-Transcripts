All right. All right. That is time. For true news, your warm, good news socks. Fresh out of the dryer. Oh, I do love that. Ooh, the bad. Oh. socks fresh out of the dryer. Ooh, I do love that. Ooh, the bath. Featies are cold, boo, now they're warm. And human warm sock, Rossi Ross Matthew. Yeah, well, thank you so much. Ha, ha, hi. Hi. Speaking of coming out warm from something, our first story is kind of that. Great transition. What does Stephen King make for dinner? Great question. Well, we've got the answer, and it's chilling. And today's food news. Nom, no, no, no, no. Okay. So the New York Post reports that Stephen King is horrifying fans yet again, but this time with microwaved fish. He posted this recipe on Twitter for a man who's written thousands of pages. It's so simple, it's actually scary. Get a nice salmon filet, not too big. Put some olive oil and lemon juice on it. Wrap it and damp paper towels. Nuk it in the microwave for three minutes, eat it. Mm-mm, mm-mm. I'm sorry, for it. What do you have? Oh, God, no, you do not. It's not carbs. Okay. It's not carbs, Rossi. I feel so honored that I didn't, that I'm not shoving a bagel or a pizza or a Fetuccine Alfredo down there. It's always a croissant or something here. I will say, I can't believe he microwaves his fish. For a man who wrote Fire Starter, you can't light a flame. Hello. All right, so we're both gonna try this? You're gonna try it. Alright, I'm gonna do a little lemon, just like you said. I have to say it does look really nice. It does. I got scared and I was like, I'll let Ross try it. And now I'm looking at it and I'm thinking I made a mistake. All right, I'll be, I'll tell you, I'm not afraid of a little microwave. All right, ready? Stephen King, there's nothing fishy going on here. It actually, it's flaky, it works. What? That's like, a twist I didn't see coming. It's actually delicious. Here, Drew. Uh, well, Well, I... I... I'll tell you a story about Stephen King instead of eating the salmon. You want to just smell it? Nope. Understood. I... You know, Stephen King, I went to stay at his house because I did Fire Starter with him. Of course. I did this movie Cat's Eye with him, which was really just stories taken from his book Night Shift. And so I got to go stay up at his house in Maine when I was a kid. And it was like the most joyful weekend of my life. They had like a house that was just like so filled with soul and his wife Tabitha and their kids. And he made pancakes in the kitchen. And then his office was upstairs in the attic, and he had a pet scorpion named Boris. So no salmon for me, but that fun story is what I will offer about Stephen King. I love Stephen King so much, and, you know, if he wants to add salmon to that illustrious resume, Microwave Salmon, so be it. Yeah. You know? You know why I love having a conversation with you? Why? Because you can go from microwave salmon to that one time I met Stephen King's Scorpion Boris. You know, you just strap on, you never know where it's gonna take you. So I didn't see that coming. Yeah. All right, next up, if you're a writer, but not quite as prolific as Stephen King, we might have a new way for you to get those tipped and type and fingers going. Through a list report, so there's a new cafe in Japan designed just for riders. They got free Wi-Fi, plenty of outlets to plug in, bottomless coffee, but there's one teeny tiny catch. You are not allowed to leave until you finish writing, all right? And you'll be charged $1.20 for every half an hour that you need extra motivation and you stay there. Yeah, you can only leave after you finished your writing goal for the day. Or when the cafe closes at seven, whatever comes first. I will say, I've written a couple of books, you've written a couple of books, it is so difficult to do because you are your own boss. It's on you to like sit down and do it and clock in and finish. And I'm like the best boss because I would sit down and be like, boss, can I have a five minute break? And I'd be like, yes, you can. And then I go, so you have to have some structure. What do you think of this cafe? I think it's great because it gives you the structure you need. When you're artists, you don't, you're not used to a nine to five. And so this gives you a reason to get in there, stay, and a goal to finish. Structure and accountability. Yeah. Raise of hand. Who thinks this idea is good and should come stateside? I double with you, ma'am. Double. Caroline, I am so with you, ma'am. What is your name? Caroline, I am so with you with the double hands. Out of curiosity, why are we enthusiastically putting up two hands? I know why for me, but why for you? Because you need that accountability to just get stuff done. I'm with you, Russ. I'll do the five minute break. Oh, totally. Sometimes I give myself a 10 minute break too, you know what I mean, whatever I need. Why not make some microwave salmon while you're at it? Well, Caroline. It wasn't bad, but I'm not saying now. Caroline, in true writing, fashion informed, you just paid the earlier story off. Yeah, thank you for that bookend. Thank you. I love this idea so much, and whatever company is doing this, please come all over the world. I just love this. This is a great story to me. Do it. Totally. I want more. I am writing a third book. I know, I know, and I'm like. Rossi, whoa, we haven't talked about this. I'm writing, I'm writing now. A little cookbook. I'm working on recipes, yes. I know. I know, is that exciting? Wow. Whoa, whoa, working on it now, is that exciting? This is, the world is right with the Rossopies book. Because that's been a thing for you for a long time. It's due. It's how I lost, you know, lost 60 pounds and kept it off cooking for myself and really trying to figure out food and be healthy and be good. But I will tell you, as inspired as I am to write this book, I am like, I need a break. So this is, I needed to hear this story today, so thank you Drew for bringing this one. I'm glad you liked it. Thank you. Oh, and here's one I have for you. We have a little woodworker in England making a really big difference. I love this story.

But now he's doing something else amazing. He's raffling off a special custom bowl for Ukrainian children. Yeah. And proceeds, we love this. They're going to go to save the children. And get this, Gabriel has already raised $327,000. Woodworking. It's incredible. He is. It's, wow. Incredible. He is such a lovely human being. I think his work is really beautiful. Beautiful, yeah.

We love her curiosity, her energy, her passion for stories. Our dear correspondent from Idaho Falls, Idaho, It's our friend Emmy Eaton! Amy! Hey! I love you, Emmy! I'm loving, Emmy! Honestly, being on your show is like getting the biggest, warmest hug. It's so nice. Oh, Amy! You know, Emmy, I'm just so amazed by everything you do. I just loved your Instagram. Being on your show is like getting the biggest, warmest hug. It's so nice. You know, Emmy, I'm just so amazed by everything you do. I just loved your Instagram because you were interviewing Craig Robinson. You were doing such an amazing job. You're such an amazing journalist. Thank you. I saw your comment, and I was, I've been looking forward to being on this. When we found out I literally was like jumping up and down, I was so excited screaming. I'm so happy. Me too. I was so excited to congratulate you on your beautiful work and be able to say, and I'll see you next week because life with you, Emmy, is just better, period. Thank you. I mean, we've been doing this show together for two years now, and guess what, Emmy? We actually made it to season three. Hi! So, oh! Two years now, and guess what, Emmy? We actually made it to season three. Hi! I'll be back. I was going to say, and this time will you come back to New York, please? Yes. Okay, perfect. All right. Now, back to the news. Emmy, will you please give us our first headline? Yes, I will. This comes from the magazine the week. A woman and I will want it to give her dad a retirement gift after he retired from the fire department. She asked fire departments around the country to send t-shirts. She wanted one from every state. She got that and even more. She even got one from Afghanistan. She's going to make them all into a quilt for her dad. I think I'm gonna ask my fire department to give her one. Oh, that's a great idea. That's smart, Emmy. That's smart, Emmy. That's a good idea. It's so special when you get something like that, a gift that means so much. You know, after my mom passed away, her best friend, Bonnie, went into her closet and took some of her shirts and made me like some pillows with my mom's shirts and it's something I treasure so much you know because the clothes we wear they're part of us you know and when you give them and make something else out of them it's beautiful don't you think emmy yeah yeah I do too I think it's so touching and special all right so you're the best in the business Emmy can I get your take on another story? Yes. All right, listen to this. I love this story. Netflix has just added a famous show from Japan, and it's called Old Enough. It's a reality show where you get to watch adorable children run errands all by themselves. Oh, my gosh. And Eni... That's cute. You like that, Emmy? Yes. Oh, really? You NPR. You like that, Emmy? Yes. Oh, really? You want to run some errands? Yeah. I got some dry cleaning you can pick up, okay, Emmy? Okay. Okay. Well, now NPR reports is not just adorable reality TV. A parents around the world say they send their kids on errands early to teach them independence and confidence, whether it's getting an egg from the neighbor's house or running to the market. Kids around the world are getting things done. Just like you, Emmy, you get it done, right? Yeah. Yeah. What's your favorite kind of errand to run? I like doing it because at the store, so like the other day, Dad let me go up. We were at a restaurant, and Dad let me go up and order food all by myself. Oh. And I go to pay for it too. Wow. Emmy, I'm curious. What do you think about this story, first of all, as a journalist, and then what do you think about it as a young woman? Well, first off, I think that's adorable. Like, three-year-olds and four-year-olds are, like, going grocery shopping on their own. So I think that's adorable. And as a journalist, I feel like, like, I'd be actually, it'd be cool to ask questions to someone who, like, to one of the kids who have actually done that. I think that'd be really cool or one of their parents. Yeah. I agree. It's like, I think there's a richer conversation here because I think we used to let our kids do whatever they wanted and no eyes on them. And now we've kind of become helicopter parents society. And so we're all shocked by this story. But I think there might be a balance we need to get back to it, like empowering our kids and letting them, you know, have autonomy and do things on their own. And I think we as parents are scared to let our kids do anything, and that's not good either. Yeah, but there should be a balance, right? Because as an eight-year-old, I could have run an AT&T store. I was on top of it. You know what I mean? I was good. But some kids maybe shouldn't be, you know, drive into Walmart, pick up groceries. Well, obviously not before they have a license. Yes, right. I'm just eight. I'm not like 16. You can't drive when you're eight here. That's right. That's right. But I really like this story. And I think it's interesting. I think we should find out what our kids are capable of and support them. And I'm talking to you, Emmy Eaton, who is a journalist on the beat and really doing extraordinary things. So look at what people are capable of. You're capable of anything, honey. Thank you. It's true. So, I just love this. And I love you, Emmy, so much. I love you guys too. We love you. Season three, Emmy, you and me. Literally, I'm gonna be able to the first episode in person and I'm gonna give you guys a biggest hug in the world. Well, you can call that a date, Emmy Eaton. Okay.

Thank you. Come on, I see you. I see you. Thank I'll see you. Thank you. Anthony. All right. That's up, thank you. I know. I stand for you, too. I'm so happy that you're here in person. The last time we hung out and you were kind enough to come on this show and grace us with your presence, you were with your mama. Yeah, yeah, it was good. It's good to be back live in studio, right? Hi, Mama. My mom always gets mad when I don't tell her I'm on the show. Mama, I'm on Drew Barrymore right now. Hi, Mama, I wish you were here. We love you so much. We had so much fun hanging out with you and your mom. I wanna ask you a quick question. In the news, we talked about Stephen King microwaves his salmon. I like to pronounce the L. Okay. He microwaves his salmon. You studied at Le Cordon Bleu. Uh-huh. That is as big as it gets. Yeah, it's all right. Dude, you went to La Cordon Blue. So what do you think of Stephen King's microwaved salmon? Well, I don't know why Stephen King would microwave salmon. But, I mean, to each his own, to each his own. And I don't understand why you would put salmon in the microwave when you eat salmon raw at the sushi bar. And I really, weirdly like raw or extremely cooked. I'm not a big pink in the center type of gal. Neither am I for salmon. No, no. No, it's either raw or well done. Like a steak. Yeah. Well, oh, I don't eat my red meat well done now. Hold on. You jump the gun on that one. You take your steaks well done? Medium well. Oh, wow. I like, because I like a little like jerky leather action. I thought, uh, I thought only my cousins in the hood did it like that. No, I must be one of your cousins. Yeah, I like, I want it leathery. You're trying to tell me we're family? Right, I'm trying to tell you we're family. Now, what is your weirdest, like, I mean, you went to Le Cordon Blu. I just studied there on the weekends. I didn't really go there for prolonged periods of time, but I would take weekend courses. But yeah, I did study it, Le Codon Bleu. Like, what is your favorite thing that you learn to cook while studying at Le Caudan Blu? No, you know, my thing was I wanted to learn how to perfect sauces. I wanted to learn to perfect stocks and sauces. And so that was my first class. And but once you perfect those, you can pretty much do whatever you want to do in the kitchen. Well, turning a complete 180, you are back to Law and Order! Boom, boom! Yeah. Bum, bum, bum! Yeah. It's good to be back. That is so exciting and so cool. Right. So, okay, you're going back. Are there any fun storylines from real life because they will pull from real life? Is there anything that's out in like the current zeitgeist right now that you would like to see attacked and approached on Law & Order? What would I like to see attacked and approached on law and order? What would I like to see attacked and approached right now on law and order that's in the news? Anyone? Anyone? No, I mean, you know, nothing in particular. It's interesting to see this whole black China, Kim Kardashian family thing that's going on, that dynamic that's going on. Or maybe Johnny Depp and his ex. Oh my God! Yeah, let's go there! Oh my God! Let's go there! I am not kidding. I had to get out of my seat. I can't- I see! I can't handle the Johnny Depp Amber Heard. It's, I am on the theater. It's like one layer of crazy. It's a seven-layer dip of insanity. It's truly amazing just to sit back and read the transcripts of what they've done to each other. Every night I get in bed and I'm like, dude's like, this needs to be on TV. He lost the fingertip. He drew his name in blood on the wall. How about the burnt body and why a Honda Civic? He lost the fingertip. He drew his name in blood on the wall. How about the burnt body and why a Honda Civic? Yes. What did the Honda Civic? You know the next day at Honda, they all came into the office and they were like, why did he pick us? Like, why? What? Who? It's fascinating. It's so fascinating. I know that these are two people's real lives, and I know- It's fascinating. It's so fascinating. I know that these are two people's real lives and I know what it's like to have your life put out in public. I understand all the feelings, but they are actually offering up this information. Nobody had to know. This is crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy. So I would like to see that on television. Okay, yeah. Well, I would, I would, and I would watch that episode. I really would. That's more of an episode. That's more of a mini-series. I totally agree. And I would want those parts. Yes. They're so juicy. All right. Well, we have to go to a quick commercial break. Stick around because we have more with Anthony Anderson. When we come right now. It's really important to find love. Because that's what makes you human.

We are here with Anthony Anderson. And we actually, I really want to talk to you about Get Real with diabetes. Because we touched on that with Mama the last time you were here. But you're doing a campaign, this is personal for you, your bike riding around the city, there's this whole lifestyle going on, and I want in on the information. Well, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 21 years ago. I was the first person in my family to be diagnosed with it, then my mom, and then we found out that my dad had been living with diabetes undiagnosed for over 20 years. And subsequently lost my father to complications of diabetes, so that's why I partnered with Novo Nordus five years ago to talk about this. And, you know, little known fact, I didn't know this, that cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes, I'm four times at greater risk to get it to die from those things than you are because I'm a type 2 diabetic. And those are things that we need to address within the community. And so we have a campaign called Get Real About Diabetes, and our website is get real about diabetes.com. And you can go there and get the information that you need to learn how to prevent the disease, and if you are diagnosed with it, how to live with it. And it doesn't have to be a death sentence. And that's what we're here to talk about. That's what we're here, you know, to give information to the community so that they can spread that information within their families and within their community so we could help hopefully one day eradicate this. I think you are. I know that you will. Thank you. Is it true that you ride your bike all over the city? I do, I do. How? I ride my bike, I bought a bike 10 years ago, 12 years ago when I was living here. I bought a bike 10 years ago, 12 years ago when I was living here. I bought a bike and just started, I ride the train. You know, this is how you get around. I walk the streets, I ride the train, and I ride my bike. And that's what you do when you live in New York. And so I'm, I'm an unofficial New Yorker. Well, I love that you're here in this city. Yeah, I love being here. I'm now a New Yorker, and I'm so proud. Although I would not attempt getting on a bike because I just know I would be road pizza in one block. One block, Anthony. Maybe you can give me lessons. I can imagine, I will. I will. We get a bike and we go, this is what we do. We'll ride in Central Park together. We'll just be easy. We'll start easy first. We're riding the park. Okay. We're riding the park. We're riding the park. Will you, I riding the park. We're riding the park. We're riding the park. Will you, I'm serious. I'm serious, we can do that. Okay, we can do that. That's a date. All right, you got it. All right, thank you. It's like every day I walk by the city bikes and the internal dialogue is you're a big wuss. You should mount that thing and be bold and ride. Oh, that's one way of looking at it. All right, well maybe you... Mount it. Just... Mount the bike, Drew. That's right. Stop being a wuss. Mount that sucker and ride! Um, okay, now, you're the host of To Tell the Truth. Yes. And you have your hot hands in so many honey pots. I do. I do. You know, I saw an opportunity to give my mother an opportunity to live out her dream. And she always wanted to be an actress, and it never happened for her because she's horrible. Mama! No. So she's my co-host on the show and we're going into seven seasons now. So, yeah. Thanks to you guys. And what more fun than to like do this with your loved one. And in honor of to tell the truth, we wanted to see if you would tell us the truth or not in this round of final five. Will you do that with us? I'm with it. All right, round of five. It's my favorite game on the show. Okay, I'm going to read off five statements about you, and you're going to let us know if it's true or false, and our studio audience can get involved by giving a thumbs up if they think it's true and a thumbs down if you think it's false. All right, you once ordered a jacuzzi on your mom's credit card without asking her. Thumbs up or thumbs down? I got a lot of thumbs up in the room. Thumbs up. The answer is no. Oh! I ordered a baby grand piano at 11. Not a jacuzzi. At 11? At 11. Mm-hmm. And then what happened? Oh, I got my. Yeah. I've been feeling that thing went back. Okay, you were a delivery mascot. Is that true or false? I like every, oh, I'd see a thumbs down over there, a couple thumbs downs, all right. Thumbs up. Oh! Thumbs up. Delivery mascot for a gourmet dessert delivery company while I was a freshman, sophomore at Howard University. My character's name was Captain Cravings. I gotta tell you this, I know we might be short on time. My outfit with black dance tights, Sparkle Chuck All-Stars, a silver long ranger mask, silver gloves, and a pink cape that said, if you ever need to be saved, I'll 797 Crave. And a white sweatshirt. I wasn't topless sometime, I had a white sweatshirt. And I said, Captain Cravings. I wanna see a picture of that. Do you have any pictures? Oh, no, thankirt. I wasn't topless sometimes, I had a white sweatshirt. And I said, Captain Cravings. I want to see a picture of that. Do you have any pictures? Oh, no, thank God I don't. Well, I have it in my mind. Okay, you drink a gallon of milk every day. What? Y'all know black people are lactose intolerant. You know that's false. I drink a gallon of water a day. Okay, you own three to 400 pairs of shoes, true's false. I drink a gallon of water a day. Um, okay. You own three to 400 pairs of shoes, true or false? You guys saw blackish. It's true. I got one hell of a shoe closet. You're a sneaker head, right? I'm a sneaker head. Okay, you won $250,000 on who wants to be a millionaire. True or false? A lot of falsees, interesting. Oh, brother, you don't think I could win a quarter of a million dollars on who wants to be a millionaire? I was riding with you on all of those questions that you, those answers you were giving me. The answer is true. I won a quarter of a million dollars for Alzheimer's. That's like one of my favorite games, who wants to be a millionaire. Congratulations on that. So as a last question, I just wanna say and ask, how does it feel to send off with a chef's kiss, if you will, the beautiful show Blackish, which was just one of its kind, so revered, so accolated. How do you feel about... I feel great with what we were about, what we were able to accomplish over eight seasons. The subject matters, racism, colorism, sexism, postpartum, depression, politics, all of those things. And edutane people with that. And thank all of you guys, and thank everyone at home for watching.

I love eating it, talking about it, watching it on TV. Here is some delicious kitchen inspiration. Today, we're going to grill a whole fish, which I know is very intimidating for certain people, but I'm going to make it look easy. We take the fish, give it an olive oil bath. Some herbs. We're going to just stick it in the belly. A little sea salt. A little pepper. And now we are ready to go. The fish will take five minutes on each side. That timing is for a one pound fish. Now it's five minutes is up. Time to flip. Simple as that. Five minutes on each side, and it's perfectly grilled. Thanks, Drew. I hope I was able to take the intimidation at a cooking seafood for you. It's what my cookbook Joe-nosed fish was all about. Have fun cooking, and thank you for having me on. Well, I know exactly what I'm making now. Delicious. On the menu this Wednesday, finally minced and seasoned beef with a layer of cheese sauce, delicately wrapped and delicious pastry and served in a plastic bag. And it's a pie. And mince and cheese.

The Special value network. Duh. I don't know. I was just thinking, what if I did it? What if I, like, auditioned?

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome one of my favorite females, Vanessa Bayer! Vanessa Bayer! It's so exciting. I love it. I really, I know, I'm just going to say, I'm like I'm going to have a woman. I feel like I'm going to have Oh, I'm so excited. I'm so much. I'm gonna blow up. I mean, I never followed a script, so forgetting. Oh my God. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I just love so many of the amazing characters that you created on Saturday Night Live. I quote you like every day of my life. What was one character that rises to the top for you or that like still resonates every day or that you're like, I just need to be that person right now? I think the person, the character that is the most truly me at my core is the barmitsfa boy. Because he's the cutest. I mean, it must feel so good because you would just move your mouth in a certain smile and the whole room would, like, go roaring laughter. Like, that must feel really good. It was really fun. I mean, it took a few tries. Like, I tried settle stuff like that before, and it didn't always, sometimes the audiences would be like, no, thank you. Oh, I know those crickets on tumbleweeds. You're like, ban, da, da, da, and they're just like, no. Not for us. And you're like, comedy is, like the drive home is painful and awkward and vulnerable. Yes, yes. Okay, so this amazing show, I love that for you, is living out a dream job. It's like a shopping network. Yes, yes. And I'm just curious, like, if you weren't a famous comedian or doing this show, like, what job would you pick as a dream job? I actually think that would be it because I watched a lot of home shopping when I was a kid and I really loved how they talked and how they talked about the products and touched the products. And I also, I think because I watched it so much at such a young age, it's like a language I learned. Does it ever get actually stuck in your head like a flight pattern for performance? Like I couldn't watch Samantha in Sex and the city, ironically, because every line I started delivering and talked about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, honey, did that ever affect you that way? Yes, exactly, exactly. But okay, this is an odd dovetail, but you know, love life. I'm just going straight ahead. Oh, yes, okay, tell me about your love life. Is it true that you're on a dating app? Yes, I think I'm, I think we might be on the same. I think we are. Have you ever seen more DJs in your life? Also, I'm pretty sure that you have to be a surfing photographer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you have to have someone else's kid. Yeah. In your picture, yeah, and show you're the uncle type. Yes, exactly. But you have to have a huge's kid. Yeah. In your picture to show you're the uncle type. Yes, exactly. But you have to have a huge dog that's so scary in a way that's like, who's that for? Yeah. And you have to be a foodie. Yeah. And shirtless. You have to be, the shirtless photos are so, and there's, it's just like, yeah, who, who is, it's a real, it's a tough, it's a tough place to be. First of all, I don't know if you experience this too, but a lot of times I'll match with someone and then they'll never message me. Oh my God! And I'm like, wait, raise of hands. Who has had this happen to them on a dating app? Right? I'm like, why are you here? Is it just like a feather in the cap and then they move on? That's what I'm also like, why don't they feel, don't they have better stuff to do with their time than match with someone and be like, okay, and then like go on? Like use that moment to like write a book or there's a cafe in Japan that's about for writers. Go there. Speaking of cafes, is it true that you are known for liking a free snack? I mean, would that be on the dating profile? It's so funny. Yeah, I love a free snack more than anyone. I love free stuff in general. I'm just very obsessed. Well, that's perfect. Inefinitely. Yeah.

So there's a new food trend, everybody. And people write into the show and they ask us to do a review. But I'm gonna hand it over to Vanessa, even though it's called Drew's Reviews. Vanessa's gonna do the review. So it's Drew's Reviews with Vanessa Bayer! So something got invented called a pizza cupcake. Wow, wow, I'm here for it. I love pizza and I love cupcakes, so this feels like a dream come true. Like I don't want to, I don't want to be rude, so I want to... Oh, I see. The center comes out. Okay, these are... Oh my God. I mean... My whole middle came out, but it was really good. That's the best part. You managed to cut with your teeth. I've got very sharp teeth. I mean... You should put that in your day now. Yeah, me. Exactly. Yeah. Look. This is it. Um, look, thoughts. Okay, well, I think if you had to sum it up in one word, it would be more pizza than cupcake. I think if you know what you're getting into, you're going to love it. But if you're expecting a cupcake, you're going to go, well, you're gonna love it. But if you're, but if you're expecting a cupcake, you're gonna go, well, you know. Not that. I mean, I'll keep eating it just like. I'm eating really a lot of food today, so I'm just like. Well, how many stars would you give this, Vanessa? I would give it four stars and here's why. Oh, that's actually, that's pretty nice. Yeah, I think it's pretty, I think it's pretty good. It's pretty tasty, but I think it's misleading that cupcake is in the title because I really, like, even if, even if you saw, like, just to you, okay, even if you saw this, you'd go, oh, that's a little, like, piece of bread with a pepperoni on it. You wouldn't necessarily go like, oh, a cupcake. You know, there's going gonna be a lot of cupcake fans going, not my day. Sorry, listen, look how we got forks. Like, what if, neither of us ever were like, oh, we should, maybe that's why we're not having luck because we're not little, we're not like little ladies who go like, oh. Look at my plate. I took out the center. Oh my God, everyone. I mean, that's, you know what? I don't care. You know what I want? Funny. I want people who put stuff out there in the world and make all of our lives better by putting smiles on our faces. And making us laugh and producing materials that's going to brighten our day. Yes, I agree. That's what I want too. Put that on the hat. Vanessa Bear, I love that for you, is available to watch today on streaming and on demand. That's right, Premier Day. It's dropped, it's hot, and it airs Sunday night on Showtime. I love you so much. You too. This was so much fun. You're really out. I guess. You don't need that? Yeah, exactly. I'm like, eh.
