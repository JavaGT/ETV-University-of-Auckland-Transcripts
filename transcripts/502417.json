We're here to celebrate and commiserate five comedians attempting to impress me by completing tasks to the best of their sometimes limited abilities. All in the hopes of winning a golden statue of my head, which nine out of ten doctors call perfectly shaped. Those comedians are Chris Parker, Josh Thompson, Justin Smith, Cooner Forrester, and Paul Ingo. These five hilarious hunts he spent the last few months in a house trying hard to complete my diabolical tasks. And to shepherd their efforts, I have my very own little bo-peep. Without the cute dress and intimidating crookets. Paul William! I don't say this enough, but I really appreciate the time and effort you put into your job. Wow. What about me? Do you like the most? I like the way that you move on to the next task really quickly. Okay, sure thing. Our first task, as always, is a prize task. Each contestant has been asked to bring something wonderful to win. Tonight, we are looking for the best thing that delights all five of the senses. My ears, my mouth, my eyes, fingers and skin are all celebrating. Let's see what you think will delight all five of my senses. Starting with Kudah. Well, I'm a simple gal. I just went with my gut on this one and the first thing that popped into my head, which is one of my favorite thing that delights me in many ways, it's a Big Mac. And you'll notice there's some sexy music going with it for your ears? He's supposed to have sex with the Big Mac. No, it's just like, there's sexy lighting, there's sexy music, and I don't know what that board is. Last week it was wine. This week it's a Big Mac. You can see how this is working for you. All I wanted you to get to know me, right? Like, hands up who's salivating? You. Paul, what's you bring in? What I'm going to show you first is something that delights the main two senses. So, butter chicken, the best taste in the world. Fresh, fresh strawberries, best smell. Around the outside there, that's a strip of velvet best feel. And then in the top, you whack one of these. Oh yeah, Jason Mamoa. Okay. Jason Mamawa, the best thing for your eyes. Yeah. And that's them. That's all of them. Was there a sound component? Oh, yeah. I've got this. Children laughing. Oh, my God. It's not the best sound. It sounded quite scary. Yeah, that was quite freaky. I think they saw that. Justine, what did you bring in? This is a R2D2 popcorn bucket from Disneyland. It looks great. Can you just look a little more interested? It smells great. Yum, hot popcorn. What else is there? Sound. Yeah, the sound of popcorn. Pop, pop, pop, pop, oh, exciting. Oh, I'm getting popcorn. Can't wait. You can firm it because actually the R2D2 is quite tactile. It comes with a little thing. You can hang around you and taste, well, fucking yum. Chris, look at you. I always love when you go to a Thai restaurant and then someone walks in with a big sizzling hot plate. And you go, whoa! And they get all the attention in the restaurant, which I think feels really good. So, voila, a sizzling hot plate. It sounds much louder than a Big Mac. No, I had sexy music. That looks like vomit. How does it feel? Oh, my God. Everyone looking at you, oh, we ordered the best thing on the menu. To the touch. To the touch. Oh, well, I mean, look at that. This lovely slimy cabbage. Josh, what did you bring in? Well, a long time ago, I bought a heavily discounted automatic tie rack from J-Car electronics. Naturally, during lockdown, I thought, why not make this tie rack into a sushi train? There it is there. Wow. Oh, it's supposed to worry the sushi. The kids really love it and I've just you got a video of my kids enjoying it here. Let's have a look. Wow. It's a sushi train everybody get on board. Sushi train. Fish and rice is your reward. Sushi train. Salmon Van avocado sushi train. Come on fishy desperado's The Coozy Train. Oh, God. What ever. Is it just me, or is Josh trying heaps harder than the rest of it? We just got takeaways. I haven't made the sushi. We just got takeaways. I haven't made the sushi. I just got takeaways too. I just happened to put it on an automated nerd. You're in a nerd. I'm an early target. I've got an early lead and I'm an early target. I won the last one. Everyone's coming for me. Well, buckle up and I'm ready to go! You want to stop for that sushi train! Go for the sushi what you say! The nerd's getting out of it. There's five points, though. There's no doubt about it. Five points for that. Paul, four points, because you get three and a half health stars for Jason Momona. Thank you. It's tricky to know whether it's going to be three or two to you, Chris, or to you Justin, but but I think because yours is slightly more culturally diverse, so you get three, you get two. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That is from Tokyo Disneyland, that popcorn bag. Originally from Tatooeen. One point for Kura. Shall I argue about it? Nah. That obviously puts the nerd out in first place with five things. It's poison your children with toast and sheep. My kids might die, but I'll win the show. Very good. Tell me, Paul, do you have a task loaded up from your little toy tablet there? It's a big boy tablet. Is it? Yes. But I do have a task. But from your little toy tablet there? It's a big boy tablet. Is it? Yes. But I do have a task. But I feel like I must warn you, if you don't like drama, leave the room immediately. Oh. Hey, P. Willie. Hello, Chris. Oh, man, this has got a whole it vibe to it, which... I may piss myself. What do you mean, at? The movie, it. The Stephen King, book, the movie, it would the... Have you not seen it? Which movie? It's called it. The movie is called it. It's not... Forget it. It still gives you a shock shock even though you're nuts. Oh, yes. He's so cute. Look at this cute little cute. This is cute. Make a dramatic exit. Most dramatic exit wins. You have 30 minutes your time starts now. I need smoke. I need to catch you with someone. Am I going to have to shit in the woods? Well, it's great that the nerds prepared to shit in the woods. I think we all know Josh would have said that regardless of the task. Oh, well, I do love seeing people leave. Who do I get the pleasure of watching exit first, Paul? She's been making dramatic exits ever since she came out of her mother's womb. Here she is, at least 15 years later, this time with clothes on, it's Cuda Forrester. Good so, yeah. I am the phantom. I've been taken hostage. First, they ate fish and chips in front of me with heaps of delicious looking sauce, but I didn't care. Then they grazed my knees. They punched my mouth. And then they punched my eye clearly. But I didn't go down. Not many people know this about the phantom, but I have a son who's also being taken hostage, and I will not rest until I find him. So to my kidnappers, I say, give me back my son. Oh, you want an exit? Ha! I laugh in the face of exits. Watch this. Wow. That was quite a good. Quite dramatic. Great script. Yeah, thank you. So just talk us through who are the characters? You're the Phantom? Yes, I'm the Phantom of the Opera. I've been heavily beaten and kidnapped after a feed of fish and chips. So there's blood but some sauce as well. Not many people normally with a dramatic exit sort of say, I'm going to exit now. And then they exit, but I kind of like the signposting. Thank you, yeah. But I disappeared, like, that's pretty, whoa, if you ask me. It felt dramatic to me. Thanks. Yeah, but who's up next, Paul? Up next, saying bye, bye, it's J.T. Josh Thompson. Alright! Get off! Splash! Splash! Word. What word? I'll finish. Oh, okay. That'll go to plan. Mind of the seen it. I hit both the doors. Punch kick. And you kicked the woman? She's not a real woman. What woman are... I mean, I don't want to get into it. Yeah, she's got tits in her... She got no head. It doesn't look good, this woman kicking thing. But if you want drama, kick a woman in half. People don't want to talk about it. If you want drama, kick a woman in half. Do you want to walk that back, or you want to keep that on the table? In my head I was like an elegant, like a gibbon like flying around. It just looked like a drunk man falling over a lot. And then sort of beating the shit out of a woman. But it's just not good. And... But dramatic. Yeah. The problem for me was that the exit itself out the barn doors, there was not a lot of drama there. So what actually went on was really post-exit, wasn't it? I mean... Uh-oh. Well, before we see how the rest of these levers left, it's time for our own dramatic exit in the form of a commercial break. But to make it even more dramatic, Paul, would you like to end it on a cliffhanger? Something I've never told anyone is... But how did my mother say to me? Nothing spreads faster. This could just be some big of stupid, delusional mistake. Than gossip. Everyone in the whole damn world knows except for me. Shorton Street, tomorrow at 7 on 2 and TVNZ Plus. Giving out tickets.

People are going to be talking about it. Basically, that's why I'm not allowed back into Portugal. That's a lot of sense. And just like that, we are back, Paul Williams. Who's exiting next? This, Justine, a comedian has made a dramatic exit. Let's cross now to Justine Smith to find out more. You'll never be a real doctor, Dr. Smith. Oh yes, I will, Dr. Chris Warner. I'll be a great doctor, a majestic doctor, a doctor that never leaves Shorten Street. Just like you. Damn you, Dr. Warner. Damn you to hell! My voice is a beautiful Shown Street The camera The camera work, which was amazing, the lighting. I designed all that. It was amazing. Thank you. Could designed all that. It was amazing. Thank you. Could you work on the real Shortland Street? Yeah. How did you think Justine's effort were? I think it's the better than anything I've ever seen. Whose next, Paul? It's our only contestant whose surname is also the name of a popular weatherproof jacket. It's Chris Raincoat. The style, British, and you're my lover, but you're having sex with him. And his name, this is, this is Greg, he's the grocer, okay? And I just want you to, I just want you to respond in the moment. I want you to be real, I want you to lean into this, and I want you to give it your whole heart. What's the line? I'm sorry, baby, I just want you to respond in the moment. I want you to be real. I want you to lean into this, and I want you to give it your whole heart. What's the line? I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like. You're sorry, baby. I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like. But like scream it. Okay. Okay. Are we ready? Oh my God, Paul. Honey. I'm home. I couldn't find George the grocer anywhere! What's going on? I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like. Oh, what the fuck is going on? Your pants are around your knees. I've been in hand taking George the grocer up the ass. Coat drinks? In front of the dog, you sick fuck. You're a monster. I dare you, you bastard. Here's your martinis, you so love to drink. And your vodka, and your gin, and your coconut water. You know what? You can die. All of you, your sons of arse. Die, you bastard. Die. And you two, George. Ah! Ha! Oh. Oh. Oh, tell you what, if that doesn't get a standing ovation, nothing on the show ever will. That's the power of queer cinema for you. What we didn't see is, is Paul's pants down different. I mean, those pants around your ankles. You've got two pairs of pants on. I have more than that. I constantly, yeah. I was furious about that because I did those pants around your ankles. You've got two pairs of pants on. I have more than that. I constantly... I was furious about that because I did want to see his bare bum. How did you feel being paled? Honestly, the whole process was incredible. Chris was a great director. Can I just say you really pulled out an amazing performance. Thank you. Like, I saw some depths to you. I've never seen before. Well, that's amazing. I watched that thing, and I didn't see any pulling out at all. If my calculations are correct, we still have one dramatic exit to go. It's time to bid adieu to Paul Igou. Dramatic kicks it from the shed. Pea Willie's looking really confused. Trematic kicks it from the shed. I'm feeling slightly aroused and abused. On here. Here we go for the finale. Here we go, dramatic hits at finale. Yeah, and some of that... Oh, boy. That's... Oh, mess that up. Okay. Thank you, Paul. Oh, I'm stoked with that. I've never made him all dramatic exit. Is that a dramatic exit? Is that a dramatic exit, or was that a happy ending? It's hard to happen. Exactly. I think that was a cry for help. I remember telling my kids I should watch the show. Yeah, yeah. I really went a different angle from the whole, some fantastic dramatic performances, but I thought, how dramatically can I just exit a shed? And I've always wanted sauce tits. You know, why not do it on national television? I can't even remember what anyone else did anymore. I've forgotten completely what happened. I'd actually forgotten I did that. As soon as I came out with those, I went, oh no. Look, technically speaking, both Josh and Paul, I think they both exited, and then the drama occurred. I think I've got to be a stickler on this. I think, Josh, you get one point. I think you get two points just because I feel sorry for you. Thank you. I think you threw your heart and soul into that. I've always wanted sauce tits. Could I think you've got three three points because I like the lighting. I like the script. I thought it was very good. Four points for you, Chris, and five points to Justine, because you did absolutely everything on that. So with two tasks down, let's do some simple mass pool so we can find out who's one step closer to owning a very, very cold Big Mac. Currently out in first equal with seven points is Chris and Justine. All right, Paul, task me, my human cock aspaniel. Oh. Woof-woof. Now that's Cocker Spaniel for Sure Thing. It's the first teen task of the season. Ooh. Hey, Paul. What a day, P. Willie. What the heck? Oh my God. How are you? Yeah, good, mate. Don't look at those. I know, aren't they? Six. God, they're brilliant. Oh, my God, are we a team? Are we your team now? Ah! Ah! You do something together, maybe? Um, maybe. How did we not hear each other? No, I'm quite loud. I've totally heard you guys. All right, we do, yeah. Okay. Well, what do we... What do we see? Milk. Milk. Bucket of milk. Father and son bonding trip. Don't touch the milk.

Paul Williams, what is happening? We're working in teams to move buckets of milk down to the dock and back in a giant plastic sphere. First up, they could be the before and after pictures for either aging or de-aging cream. It's Chris and Paul. Do you want to get in it? I'll get in it. I'll get in it. I don't think I'd get through the hole. I've got to do quite a few holes in my time. Can I just see what it's like? I think we should conceal it. Badly said anything about that. Can we cover it with something? Yeah, like a plate. I'll get some tape, Paul. All right, you get some tape. That's like the perfect size. Fuck ya. You suppose some milk? Yeah, we have. No, I don't think so. We haven't started yet. That's not gonna splash-splosh too bad. Oh, look, we've made a service. Okay, do you want to... Like a reverse burst. I'll pass your cup of milk, okay? Time on. All right. Have you put on weight, Chris? Oh my God! This is reminding me a bit of being in the closet. Thanks, well? Yeah, we've hit the tree. Honestly? I'm just going to get you over this bit. I feel invincible. Where is it? It's right. Here to our left. Oh, well there. Okay, ready. Good night. Cheers, mate. Cheers our left. Oh, well there. Okay, ready. Cheers, mate. Cheers, mate. Cheers, brother. Oh, good honey. Both milks have been chaired. Now we're going to come. That's beauty. Oh, my God. You okay? Oh, my God. I'm all right. I'm all right. My A. Yep, you're going great. You just carry on. Look at you. Go, little fella. Go, baby. Yeah, Chrissy P. Okay, stop them. Stop me. Great. I've got your mother. I've stopped the clock. Oh, it's so hot in there. This is why happens when the drama kids do cross-country once. Woo! I wonder whether you're starting to regret your choice of footwear now with those crocs. Because that's a crock-related slip, that one. That was definitely due to the crocs. Oh, totally, yeah, yeah. They were very milky crocs. I wouldn't recommend that. I had no idea he failed so hard. He was like, yeah, no, it's right, did he had a wee fool out there. But I didn't realize he, I completely collapsed. Oh, yeah, I've been in hospital for three weeks. Was there anything the milk spilled? I felt like there was a little bit at the start there. A small amount. 9.4% of their milk was spilled. Their time was 8 minutes and 46 seconds, but then they spilled 9.4%, meaning their adjusted time was 9 minutes and 35 seconds. Well, that might be impressive. It's quite hard to tell until we see the other team in action. And surely they're at an advantage having an extra person. So since they have an extra person, they have an extra bucket of milk. It's Justine, Josh and Kura. We could put it in something bigger. You could get a rope and you could drag your milk while helping the Zorpe. You know? What rope? Like you can put the milk into... That's going to be a disaster as well. This could be the best thing. Is it? Wait, wait, wait, wait, minute, bit. You're so terrifying. No, no, no, I just want to plan it before. Otherwise, you'll be in the Zorpe. Should we cover milk? And I'll just be like, a ripped hunk. I'm not sure not to do. Oh, you're actually, oh. Isn't that what we're supposed to do? No. Just to catch any spills. Oh, I thought we were. Because it's not, sorry, I left for 30 seconds. I think you're very brave for doing this. Ah! Ah! That's not! The clock is on. The clock is on. The clock is on. So we've got the milk, guys. This is kick ass. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, no. Cheers! I'm scared to go down to the hill! Look, I'm gonna go back. Oh, I've got a lot of milk. Okay, the milk is going down and back. Oh, my God, we did it! Go, go, go, go. Cheers! Cheers the cow. Oh, great work. Watch up a lot. Oh, no, go. Cheers. Cheers, the cow. Great work. Watch up a little. Oh, no, I'm okay. You're doing great. Good, nice. Oh my God. So good. Go out on the front. Whoa, buddy. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm getting out. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's a tear away, so it I'm getting out. Okay. Oh, God. It's a terrible waste, isn't a terrible waste. Fuck me. Oh, we knock your little fence down. Sorry, mate. Yeah, that was a sore woman. Oh, I've got milk all over me, and shit. You think three heads would be better than two, but I kind of felt like there was a distinct lack of trust in that group there. Goethe, you seem to be doing all the work inside of the Zorb. Yes, look at that place. She's so scared to say anything. That was a team effort. Well, I had a really fun time. Well, I was covered in shit. They seem to spill a lot of milk. So their time was nine minutes and 28 seconds, but they lost 14.7% of their milk. So their adjusted time was 10 minutes and 51 seconds. Dress. Paul and Chris, you guys get five points each. Pretty the way to go. And I think you guys could have got four points, but I just didn't like the niggle that was going on on your team, so you get three points each. Well, if he didn't like that niggle, you're not going to like the rest of our team charts. So what are the scores looking like now? Out in first with 12 points, Chris Parker. Wow. It's time to go grab yourself a tour. So what are the scores looking like now? Out in first with 12 points, Chris Parker. Wow!

The fourth semi-final of Britain's Got Talent, Friday on 2 and on TV and Z-plus. Welcome back to Trasmaster. Paul Williams. What say, we keep this moving along with another task. Sure thing. This next task gets a very solid 3.14 star rating. Come on, come on. Where are you, Paul? You're in there, Paul. Hi, Paul. Hello, Josh. Holy. Oh, pie. I see you've been very busy in the kitchen. That's a nice short crust. I hope it's not ate pie. All the information you very busy in the kitchen. That's a nice short crust. I hope it's not ate pie. All the information you need is in the time. First one, James. Okay. Out of out, please. Right, sorry. Recipe pie. Recipe pie? She's got recipe. Recite pie to the most decimal places. Your one and only attempt starts in 10 minutes. Your time starts now. Can I use a googling something to my... Oh. Can I read it off the paper? No. It has to be off by heart. Yes. Why is this here? It's just sort of a decoration. You know what I'm like around baked goods? You can't put shit like this in the table? Once again, I'm hearing a lot of complaining coming from you, Josh. I mean, it's not fair. I don't know how this goes, but if I do badly, it's probably because of the apricot pie that was put in front of it. You can smell it when you walk in. All I could smell was Paul in his Lings Africa. Paul, who is first? It's Josh Paul and coulda. I reckon I could probably only remember like a page a minute. Kachoo! Photographic memory. Where's the next decimal place? Oh, these are all decimal places. photographic memory. Where's the next decimal place? Oh, these are all decimal places. 3.141592563. Right, remember that. Do you want to share this?

I'll probably have to need this, but then I'll just go back to numbers. 5-9-7-2. I'll get thirsty. I'll probably get to drink my own urine. 2, 3, 3, 4, 9. 7-38. 6. 7-8, 7-9. Is that as far as you want to go? Yeah. For a few letters in there. Where? Did I get it? I can't say. Do you want to know how the others did? Yes. I can't, I can't tell you sorry. Well, I did better than I thought, but I don't know if you could tell I was making some of that up. I've got it all written in front of me. So if any of them were wrong... He'll be able to tell. Yeah. Thank you, Josh. He'll be able to tell. Yeah. Thank you, Josh. You're going mad. Paul, your conviction around those numbers was quite impressive. Thank you. The only issue was that at the bottom there was a graphic that was going along which showed that you didn't know what on earth you were talking about. Yeah, I remember a few, but then I just thought, I'll just chuck some in. He won't notice. He'll just be distracted by the fact that I ate an entire pie. I think he noticed when you said 11. That's a number? What, 11's a number? It's a number, Paul, that's right. Josh, you were willing to die at one stage. Yeah. Then you were willing to drink your own urine. And by the end of it, you'd sort of moved on. Yeah, I just committed to learning the first nine or whatever it was, and then I didn't realize I got them all right. Where did we get to? So Paul recited pie to nine places. Yeah? Kudah recited pie to 12 places. That's impressive. And Josh recited pie to 13 places. That's impressive. That was good. I feel like our reciting can only get better or worse from here. You know, we don't actually have to even watch. Let's just stop on it. Let's eat on. That's fine. Yeah, that's great. Chris and I are fine. Who needs to cool? Her name has seven letters, which is crazy, because I've received seven letters from the police telling me to stop loitering outside Jeremy's house. It's Justine. I have to recite it to you. In ten minutes. Okay, no problem. 3.14159-9-26-535-8-9-7-9-3-8-8-3-7-9-0-5-0-5-8-8-8-2-8-8-7-9-9-8-8, 327950. 288497-1-6-93939375-1081810. 2701-9-3-8-52. 1105-55-9-6-44-16-1-045. Am I done this correctly? Quite ambitious. Oh 47, 101018, 194, 8,0005-4-8-4-4-4-5-4-7-8-4-7-8. Quite ambitious. 47-1018194. 8235-4-4-4-4-7-816. Ah. You ready? 4? Reciting pie? Reciting's from memory. You ready? Yeah. Three. Mm-hmm. Five? Do I get more chances? Oh, do you? I got to say how long numbers, though. Sorry, I thought you were really good at memorise. You're an arse, Paul. And sure you pie? You can take the pie if you want. I'm going to smash that pie in your face again. Okay. I hate maths. I hate numbers. I hate Paul. No, I hate the caravan. That's great. So how do you think you went there, Justin? Well, pretty poorly, Jeremy. How did Justin go there, Paul? Well, she got the three, and then, yeah, the rest was wrong. I thought maybe you just had to do it, and then if you made a mistake, reading it... I had a nervous break down, and I... I'm sorry. You look fabulous reading it, though. Yes, so good. It was so good. Don't patronise me. So good. It was shit. I Don't patronise me. So good. It was shit. I'm embarrassed about it and I was in the car driving home, feeling embarrassed about it. And now a few months later, embarrassed again, so yay! I wouldn't be that embarrassed, Justine, honestly. Surely not. So there's one more, isn't there? I'll just take myself out actually. Who is he? And what witty quip do you have to introduce him? Surely not. So there's one more, isn't there? I'll just take myself out, actually. Who is he? And what witty quip do you have to introduce him? He's the man who took the first five letters of his hometown and turned them into his name from Christ's church. It's Chris Parker. Need like visual cues. One, duck. Five spoons. Nine pieces of fruit. One, four, one, five,, nine pieces of fruit. One, four, one, five, nine, two, six, five. One, four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five. Eight, nine, seven. We're running out of objects, and so I'm just kind of doing it in a southern accent. Right. One, four, one. Five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, eight, nine, seven, nine, three, two, three, eight, four, six. That's it. Don't you fucking give me another number. Just, and when we're ready to go, go, I'm going. Okay. Because we are holding together. Stop. Are you ready for your recital uh-huh one four what's the first number of pie three three point no You've done one more teeth. No. Okay, well, fine, whatever, and now I'll just do one for me. One. Four, one. Five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, eight, nine, seven, nine, three, nine, three, two, seven, nine, three, two, three, eight, four, six. And you thought you had a nervous breakdown. I'll ask you the same question I asked Justine. How do you think you went there? I'm lostful words. We were in there for so long. I learned a full routine. Just completely thought, wow, I'll forget the first number. And then I started doubting myself. And then I felt sad. And then I felt unhinged. And then I kind of felt angry. And then I kind of ended horny which was surprising. Oh man. So Chris successfully memorized 21 of the first 22 numbers. Yes. Unfortunately he forgot the very first round. But you know what? No, it wasn't even fun. I don't know. Can you remember any of it? God, no. I've bled that whole thing out. One, five, one. Three. Thank you for this opportunity. Thank you. I love it. Thank you for me. I actually love this show. Cool, please do what Justine and Chris failed to do and put some numbers in an order or some scores, please. Well, the question is, a point for Chris, or no points for Chris? Well, give Chris a point. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Well, you get two points. Oh, do I? Yeah. Unless you've got a lot in a bit. Yeah, yeah. Great, great, great. So one point for Chris, two for Justine, because she got a number. Three points for Paul, four points for Kudda, and five points for Josh. But it's all still to play for it. Make sure you come back to find out who's taking it all home after these advertisements.

Welcome back to Taskmaster. We're in a array of numerical figures are going to be used to determine who's going to get to have their five senses overloaded with some sizzling beef that stopped sizzling about half an hour ago. Paul, who's in the league? It is a nail biter. In first equal on 14 points, Paul Ego and Josh Thompson. There's only one way to settle this, but since fight to the death is banned on most television time slots, it's going to have to be a live task. Head up to the stage, please. That's a good old-fashioned Kiwi shed there, so I can only assume there's going to be some good old-fashioned Kiwi tasking going on. Who's going to read the task? How about Justine Smith? Sure thing, Paul. Memorise the names of the fish on the poster in the shed. You have 100 seconds and your time starts now. Can't open it. Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, it's cozy. Look at God. Oh, it's cozy.

Go follow your nose, eyes, mouth and whatever body parts make up your five senses and let yourself be overwhelmed, away you go, son. That's night we've seen dramatic exits, some bickering over spilt milk, and the television first of someone reading 1,000 numbers off a piece of paper. But mostly, we've also seen that there can only be one winner of the second episode of Taskmaster. And that person is Josh Thompson. Well, Marie A, good night. We'll see you next week. Oh. Oh, no, he's loved them behind. Run a full marathon fastest Just kidding Just kidding Ah I'm going to be Four! What's the f*** going on? This whole episode's going to be cut."}
