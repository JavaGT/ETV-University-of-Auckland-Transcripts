I was on a mission in the 2018. Didn't go well. The summer 2018, did you reset the clock? Yeah. Hi! How many times? A lot. We have to go again. We have to try again. The mission was successful. I remember you all from Paris. Last one standing. Dennis Ripperov is on almost every terror watch list in the world. He's ex-Lezeris. One of our brightest and best. You want to turn back time? Yes. Okay. Oh, hey, Faye. Hey. Everything alright? Everything's great. Everything's gather. It's a group called the Lost Glory. They've got a name like an Intent's Awareness Campaign, but they're a serious outfit. And we believe at some point in the next few months they're going to be in possession of Big Boy. Rebrovs confirmed they are the group he was working with in Paris. Virgil Isaac's leader of the glory since 2015. If anyone knows where Big Boy is, it's this man. So do we have a lead on with you? Well, we haven't got anything concrete from Rebrov, but Interpol have given us a lead on a possible base in the Czech Republic, 50 miles from Prague. So we're going hunting. Hey. Hey. Look, um, I want in on this. Oh, the mission? No, you're not going. Look, come on. Actually, I need this. Why? Why do you need it? What part of joining a wet team in a scragy bit of land in Eastern Europe? To fight with terrorists, do you need right now? I want to be useful. Well you're not useful. Not currently, not in the field. Why not? What you think because I lost someone that makes me weak? I can do this. Look, I trust you. Okay, this isn't about that. I'm not going to rush you back and that is my final word on it. They're a pseudo-fascist, libertarian. Free the people from the shackles of whatever and so on. Fucking nonsense group. I lost glory. Jesus. I'm offended to be working with these people. Yeah, well, the interport gave us a lead on their base, so pretty soon they won't be working with anyone. If they get wiped out, that's my best chance to get into Big Boy Gun. Relax, the bomb's not going anywhere. The key's the detonator. That's the game. So how do I get it? I give you a contact who can make it for you. Who? Someone who is likely to slit your throat and bury an unmarked grave is help you, but... I guess that's just a contact who can make it for you. Yeah. Someone who is likely to slit your throat and bury an unmarked graves help you, but I guess that's just a risk I'm going to have to be willing to take. Yeah, that sounds great. When I've got to get to the bomb before then? Tell the lost glory they're coming. What did I have a friend of? They have a YouTube page. You see it, me? No. You write them a convincing message, Nelskatter. The detonator. Carrera into Santa Teresa. 080. 12. Barcelona. That's the address. When you get there You'll tell her from me This couldn't have gone Any other way I I'm going any other way I I'm gonna. Sorry, it's a bit cold. I suppose that's the worst part of pregnancy, right? Cold tummy. Until there's a medicine ball coming out, you've a china. That part's arguably worse. And how many nights will it be till the baby's sleeping through the night, do you reckon? Week up most. Do you want to know what you're having? Having a real good fucking time is what I'm having. Talks a lot when she's nervous. What is it? A little boy? A little boy. A little boy. Oh, wow. I don't know what to say. Congratulations, it's traditional. Fuck, Janet, you know the deal. Time your conceptions just before the checkpoint. So romantic, when you put it like that. Janet? Archie. We don't exactly plan it, you know? I mean, there are reasons these rules get put in place. Get pregnant between January and June, and if we go back to the previous year, the worst thing you lose is probably a pregnancy. Get pregnant between January and June. And if we go back to the previous year, the worst thing you lose is probably a pregnancy. Get pregnant between July and December, and you could lose something a lot worse. I know. The worst thing you lose could be a lot worse. Firstly, I've lost a pregnancy before, so let's not dismiss that as no big deal, okay? And secondly, don't talk to me like I don't know the rules I've been doing this longer than you. I'm sorry. It's fine. So when you're due? Pretty much July 1st. What happens if it's early? What happens if you have your baby before the checkpoint and we jump back 12 months? Why not get a termination and follow protocol? Why take the risk? This is my baby. This one. It's all there is. Well then, congratulations. No. Just dying away for a little bit, love. But I think I need to do it. I think it might all be a bit fucking mental, to be honest. But here you are. I'm not gonna light a shit back about you. He's gonna tell me I don't need that many t-shirts or a weekend away. Don't pack that size deodorant. You have to chuck it at the airport. What I'm gonna do blow up the plane with my shore eyes. Checking online. Printed off my boarding pass, so I'll put that in with my passport in the front on my bag. Like you always tell me. Fucking out. Fucking out. Fucking out. Thank you. I'm gonna'a. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who are you? Redbrook sent me. He told me this couldn't have gone any other way. How much? How much what? How much trouble is Ian? So we got a tip off and picked up some of his friends. One of them gave him up. He doesn't have any friends. Clearly. After the checkpoint then. What you know about the checkpoint? I was in Lazarus, just like you. I hadn't? Long time ago now. Dennis didn't mention that? No. What did you mention about me? That you were as likely to slit my throat, has helped me. Look, I need you to make me a detonator. I need... I need... Me does a guilletet, if you's plough. I'm here hookered to wettation. Dennis and I haven't seen each other for a long time. But we have a system. Phrases that we pass one to each other with different meanings. Trust this person. Be wary. Kill on sight. Different messages that only we know. It's couldn't have gone any other way. Huh? Does that mean then? Will you stay for dinner, George? No much blood? Not much. Just's just spotting. What spotting? I read the fucking leaflets, I need now. Why haven't read the fucking leaflets? Why don't you tell me? Spotting. What's what it sounds like? Spots of blood. Is it a lot? Is it too much? I don't know. I'm not a doctor. Do you need to make those dumb sirens louder. That's fine. You're totally healthy. The baby's fine. Are you sure? Does I think I run off with some people on the way here? He's joking. Look, it happens sometimes. And we do get a lot of very panicked mums coming in, but you have nothing to worry about. It's a delicate pregnancy. But it's also a healthy one. Any more bleeding or any questions or concerns always come straight back. Try not to run anyone over them. I'm in position. Waiting orders. The firm is you? We're here, Shiv. What's going on? Got a tip-off that are rogue states planning on selling chemical weapons to North Korea. Shiv's on the ground now. Where have you been? Nowhere. She had a bleed. What? It's fine. We saw the doctor. You sure? Absolutely. I drew very fast. I really did. You okay? Fine. She had a bleed. She's bleeding? What's going on? Nothing? Everything's fine. Janet's bleeding? I'm not. I'm fine. Everything's fine. You went to the doctor? He said it was actually quite common. I have leaflets. I can confirm Agent Rebrov has leaflets. Shiv. Any movement there? Yeah. Yeah, I've got a car going from the west. Looks like the drop off that thing. I've got eyes on the target. Looks like he's closing the deal. Do I have a green light? Green light. Shib, you are go for extraction. Copy that. And one last push. Really well done. No. No. Oh. No. One last push. And he's the boy. Oh, my... I know. Yeah. I know. Oh. I know. Oh, Liz. Oh. Oh. Oh. I know. You shot the wrong man. He uses decoys. Intel fuck up. What's the next move? We're going back out there. There's talk on the channels that he may have made the arm's said already. The North Koreans have the weapons? No. We think that was a decoy too. That's a lot of fucking decoys, Shiv. I know. Who has the weapons? We don't know. Well, you need to find them. We're working on that, I promise. I'm getting on a place. I don't need you to talk about it. I need you to do it. So, what's your story then? What I know about you is that you have a history of Robb, you might want to kill me, and you can make detonators for nuclear words. Oh, what else is there? Could start with your name? Don't want to tell you my name. Was that little girl your daughter? They don't want to talk about her either. Do you have a favourite football team? Crystal Palace. Wasn't actually expecting you to have a lot football team? Crystal Palace. I wasn't actually expecting you to have a lot for that one. Go Eagles. Palace? Makes sense why you want to blow up the planet? I don't want to blow up the planet. Oh, it's just a nuclear detonated thing, so just differently. I won't be the one pressing it. Won't be you. Yeah. Do you want to blow the planet up? No, I just want to blow the planet up. No, I just want to... Yep. That'd be you. Yeah. Do you want to blow the planet out? No, I just wouldn't turn back time. There you go then. Your name's Janet, isn't it? She told me about you. Tell me what happened. I'm sure she didn't tell you all of it. Maybe we should go out for a walk. Take her minds off things. I don't want to go for a fucking walk. I want to find out what's happening with the arms deal. Two days. Less than that now. This isn't a no news. There's a good news situation, Dennis. What if they're already all dead? What have they given the order now? I've talked to Wes. I've talked to Archie. I've spoken to everyone, and I've told them to keep us in the loop. Less than 48 hours till checkpoint, and there's a missing chemical weapon out there. Keeping us informed isn't a priority. In fact, I'd say it's the exact opposite of that. It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Hey. Ah. In the end, it wasn't Lazarus that told us. It was a contact of Dennis's at the CIA. He picked up wire reports of a detonation in China. We were just hours from the checkpoint. hours from our son being safe. I'm not sure you should be here. There was a chemical weapons attack. No, that's just countryside. That's a rural area. It's a Chinese military compound. Well, what are the casualty reports? What's Beijing saying? Their fleet have been made attack ready. No one's claimed credit for it. We've intercepted communications between the Russians and the Chinese. They're blaming the Americans. They can't substantiate that. They don't have to. The wheels are already in motion. This is ridiculous. It's a code black. I'm authorizing us to go back. We don't know how it's going to pan out. No. And we don't have time to wait and see. Please, please. Wez, we're cheese. It's cheese. Risky, I'm sorry. Fay, make the call. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. You're killing him. You don't know how this is going to be. There's no evidence linking this to the Americans that this is just Chinese posturing. We can use diplomatic channels. If I had a week, yes, even about a few days. But I don't. I don't even have a day. I have hours left and the Chinese are making all the wrong kinds of noises. And our window of opportunity to undo this is vanishing. I don't have a choice. Faye, make the call. Please, please, please, please, please don't do this. Wait. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Jesus, Christ. Jesus, Jesus, Christ. Please, go and get back to work. Jesus, fucking Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. Please, please. Please. Please. Ah! Yeah, yeah. I'm... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I want to have a funeral for him. Mother mothers get that, don't they? When their baby dies, they get to have a funeral. I don't know what to have a funeral? I don't know what to. We tracked down the buyers, but... I don't need a debrief, Shiv. All the intel pointed to that man being the target. There was no way to know that... Fuck, I am so fucking sorry. Yeah. People keep saying that to us. Fucking hell. That wasn't the end of it. Not by a long. Not by a long shot. You can sleep on the sofa. Shot. You can sleep on the sofa. Tomorrow I'll start work. Lima units approaching the compound, ETA 20 minutes. George seemed okay to come on the George seemed okay to you better than he was that's what concerns me pretty keen to come in this mission wasn't he he just wants to be useful what? You know what this guy was in an office making shitty phone apps a year ago. Now he thinks he's James fucking Bond and his girlfriend's dead and he's screaming at us to let him join a mission. He's totally unequipped for. He wasn't ready for Paris. He isn't ready for this. None of it. Tell me if I'm wrong. I think you're wrong. Well, I hope so. Nima for to. Go. They left in a hurry. They left in a hurry. Someone must have told them we were coming. Found something. Might not be a wasted trip. I lost a trip. I lost a baby too. Doesn't be the same, but it's not important for anything, but... It's... It's okay. How's you know how'd you know how to do that? I went to night classes. I'm good with machines. Don't understand how things work. Do you know how the time loops work? I've got an idea. And? I hope I'm wrong. Why are you helping me? Because I owe Dennis. And because... Even though he's not perfect, he deserves better than being stuck in a Lazarus cell. He wants to destroy the world. He doesn't want to destroy the world. He's hurting. People lash out when they hurt. I went to the doctor. It worked. It worked. I'm pregnant. How's you looking? How's you looking? Everything's exactly right, except your pronouns. You're having a girl. A girl? Mm-hmm. Would you like a copy? Um. We've made it. We've made it. Ah. Here we go. Here we came on. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Okay. Welcome. Oh. Hey. Welcome home, little one. Thank you. You're not drawing a pension from Lazarus? No. How's you get back? We manage. This is nice. It's nice to get out of the house. Take a break from the nuclear detonator for a bit. You like to make a joke Jacob brings, don't you? Yeah, I guess. You remind me of him. Oh, Rembrands. I don't seem like a joking guy. Oh, he used to be very funny. Fuck, I used to be funny. No, you know how you said you two had phrases that you'd give to people to let you know if they could be trusted? What phrase would Rebaud have had to find on me to make you kill me on the spot? Big pans at a foot. And then, what, you were just... Beating you to death with a saucebone. Ouch. I'm nother. Archer. Fighterjet got shot down and the Modena being blamed for it. I don't think it could snowball into something if we don't step in. No one told me. We don't think it's going to be a big deal. You're not keeping me out the loop, aren't you? No. How's the little one? Good. And Janet? Fine. You'll tell her I'm thinking of her. We miss her. I'll tell her. Yes, sir. Oh, sir. Oh, sir. There's been. There's been a problem. What kind of problem? Things are escalating here. There's talk of a missile strike. Is it? It's a code like Dennis. You need to talk to Janet. Well done, that's it, well done. That's it, my love. Hello again, kiddo. Sorry about that. I was thinking. By the way, I want you to move in with me. There are we all right. There's called Sarah. There we go. There we go. Well done. What the fuck's going on? They're trying everything they can, I promise. They're not trying hard enough. And one last push. They told me I have a gift. That I could use it for good. No, it's not a gift, it's a fucking nightmare. And as I went back, time and time again to give birth to my daughter, I could see it in her eyes. She had it too. Jet is fucking done. It's fucking done. Johnny, where are you? Johnny, where are you? Johnny. How could you? How could you do that? What could you do that? In the end, neither of us could take it anymore. There you go. It all became... Jenny, can you hear me, love? One experience. Pain and blood and screaming. And my daughter ripped from inside me again and again and again. And for the longest time, I truly believed it would never end. We have to go again. We have to try again. The opposition just took the Parliament building and the TV station. Our intelligence shows it worked. No, we're clean. We're clean. No. It's not giving us anything new. Okay. Please, no. It's not giving us anything new. Okay. Dennis. Hey. You're all right, Faye. Sit. I need to see it. I need to see the machine. There is no machine. There's got to be something. Who are you calling? Who's on the other end of the line? You know I can't share that information with you. What is it? A shadowy cabal of billionaires? Secret Society. Alien spaceship. I need to know who the fuck I'm working for. You work for me. I'm as high up the chain as you go. Dennis, I'm working for. You work for me. I'm as high up the chain as you go. Dennis, I am so sorry for everything that's happened to you. Shut up. Just shut up.
