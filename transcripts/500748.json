Well by now we've all felt the financial squeeze at the petrol pump and the checkout but this Thursday we'll hear just how high inflation's crept up. So big question time. What will this quarter's calculations mean for you and your faunae? Filling the tank or your belly is a whole lot more expensive than it was 12 months ago. And this week, the inflation rates set to soar to a 30-year high. It'll be confirmation of the financial pressure we've been feeling for months and will likely see the Reserve Bank bump up the official cash rate, meaning another rise in interest rates. So what can you do now to get ahead? For more on this, we're joined by independent economist Shamabil Jakub. Great to have you with this, Shamabelle. This is really concerning, right? We're talking a lot about the cost of living at the moment. How bad is the forecast? Look, the cost of living is going up really fast, up around 7% in the last 12 months, and that'll be the highest we've had in over 30 years. So how will it affect average New Zealanders? Well, look, for all of us, we are experiencing this in things like necessities, right? Going to the supermarket, going to fill up our car, in terms of rents. So it's fairly widespread. The inflation we're seeing is very widespread across both globally, but also all parts of New Zealanders. And it means that for all of us, we have to really think about how do we cope with this big increases in cost of living. And I guess with more increases in the OCR on the horizon, how can mortgage holders really themselves, Shamabille? Yeah, so this is one of the big ones. So today the Reserve Bank Governor, Adrian Moore, was talking about how he's really worried this big increases inflation will mean that people will ask for big pay rises and that will become this kind of self-sustaining cycle of increasing prices. And so they're raising the OCR. That means mortgage rates are also going to go up. For recent borrowers in particular, this is a really big risk because mortgage rates were just so low recently that a big increase now could really put people over the edge. And so there's a few things we can do. One is around just making sure that you cut out, you know, all the fun things in your life, unfortunately, all the luxuries and those kinds of things. But more importantly, it's really important that you go and talk to your bank and make sure you tell them early on if there's a problem. That if you think that you're going to be running into trouble, go and talk to them because they can do things like moving on to interest only, extend your terms. So there are things to do if you're feeling that you're right on edge. Shamabille, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it, as always. We'll see you next time. Thank you. A is B in 7 Sharp, keeping you one step ahead. I love the sound of that, giving up the fun stuff. No more fun stuff. What are you giving up? Well, I feel like I've spent a lot on chocolate recently, but it has been Easter, so I feel like that's maybe a necessity. You're allowed to do that. And I saw a block on Hillary's desk that she's left here, so we can grab that. We can grab that instead, and we'll save ourselves some money. Right, whether you like to admit it or not, for a lot of us, masks have made us that little bit less conscious of our appearance over the past few years. For the best part of two years, face coverings have allowed us to ditch daily enhancements like lipstick or the shaver. Is now the time to give some attention to the lower half of our face. Laramore Haidam masks have helped us hide a multitude of sins. Unshavened beards, unwanted facial hair, and that dreaded mask knee love meant cutting down on makeup not to mention lipstick ladies do you even remember how to apply it but as we make our way out of the pandemic and wear masks less is it time to devote some attention to our lower facial region well for more on this we're joined by Dr Catherine Stone from the Face Place and Catherine, have people change their perceptions of what's important in terms of their appearance over the past few years? Yes, I definitely think we've seen a change in people's perception of themselves. Zoom face is a known thing that's been spoken about in the medical literature and it's actually been shown that 43% of people after seeing themselves on video calls have found new things that they want to treat in their face. Also, we've noticed an increase in, obviously, with covering the lower face, and demand for the upper face treatments, like hollows under the eyes, lifting the eyebrows, and softening that grumpy frown that we've kind of all developed over the last few years with dealing with this pandemic stress. Yeah, so is there going to be a real change in the treatments that you're offering as the masks start to come off? It's a little early to tell for New Zealand, but internationally what they're reporting is that as the masks come off, obviously the focus is going from the eyes to the lower face. And that's all about balance, which is something that we should be focusing on. So we're noticing chins, jawline, lower lips, obviously, is a big one. And also the sad mouth kind of turning that frown upside down. So, Catherine, tell us how the stress of the pandemic has impacted people's treatment choices. Obviously, we know there's been a lot of stress with the pandemic side of things. What a lot of people don't realize is that the cosmetic procedures actually do have an emotional impact. There was a really good study that was done last year, I believe, and it showed that 70% of people actually have treatments for their emotional well-being. And there's some great research using the neuromodulators like Botox for not just headaches and teeth grinding, but also for symptoms of depression. Wow. Catherine, the big one that I know a lot of people will be asking is, how do you get rid of mask knee? Oh, mask knee. Isn't it awful? Horrible. What we do in clinic will use, often change people's skin products. So good medical grade skin products that include things like vitamin A, helping that skin turnover, helping to unblock the paws, skin treatments. And there's a great LED light treatment which helps to heal the skin and kill the acne bacteria. Something you can do at home. Wash your masks separately. And what I would recommend, if you can get your hands on, some hypocloric, don't use hyperchloric, it's slightly different. But hyperchloric acid is something that also kills covid and is very kind on skin but also kills a wide range of bugs including that acne bacteria brilliant people are going to be very happy to hear that thanks so much katherine great to talk to you great to talk to you thank you so much thanks for your time mask knee i know it's horrible but humid weather as well with masks on doesn't help. Do you know what I found? As soon as I switch from using material face masks to the more medical grade kind of N95s, it went away completely. Because I had quite irritated skin for a while. You're right. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. I think I'll survive. But that was good advice. Very good advice. Many of us have found heroes in the pages of a favourite book, someone who is just a little bit like us, or at least who we aspire to be. For New Zealand's Rainbow Community, that's not so easy. Yeah, books featuring positive role models have been harder to come by. But as Carolyn Robertson reports, thanks to an at-home bookstore, it's no longer a problem. Remus might look like he's having a ball. Good boy, Rhine. But make no mistake, this corgi is on the clock. He's the official mascot for Altauas' newest seller of stories, the Alphabet Book Club. We are at a LGBTQA-A-plus bookstore. This lounge in Levin is ABCHQ. There was a big joke that went around about how part of the gay agenda was taking over the alphabet. Jokes aside, this venture is a meaningful new chapter. Our focus is primarily on that younger age bracket. We wanted to do something to try and have an impact on lowering the youth suicide rate in New Zealand through positive and honest representation of queer people through literature. Oh my goodness. This is only half of them as well. It's really hard to access in New Zealand. There's not a lot of it that makes its way here. You know, sometimes you get the token queer character in a book, or the comedy sidekick. There's also just a big focus on books that are about trauma. So the trauma of coming out. There is a place for those books, but we also just wanted books of queer people just living their lives and going on adventures and falling in love and just joy. The idea to be the ones to curate such a collection was sparked by a quest to find a copy of a favourite fable. It was going to cost us nearly three times the cost of the book in shipping and was going to take three to four months to get to New Zealand. We found it at a couple of city libraries, but there was a wait list of over 99 people at one of the libraries and over 40 people at another library. So we started thinking, oh, there's a demand for it, but there's just no supply. Now there's definitely no supply issue. Thank you for your order. There is, however, a space issue. I'll just keep going. Readers can buy a book online or sign up for a monthly subscription box. In that box, we also have little curated items for the reader to open as they read the story. Some of our customers are not safe to be out. So we have two packaging options as well. One is out and proud where we just grab a whole bunch of rainbow stickers and cover packages. And the other one is quiet pride where it's just a simple brown parcel. Thank you. Chelsea reads every single book. If a parent, for example, wants to just check on what the content might be triggering for their child, then the information is there as well. And somehow they still have time for a podcast. And I am currently still reading the advanced reader's copy of Heat Wave by T.J. Clune. Balancing the books with other full-time jobs is proving to be worth it. I had an email from a dad whose kid was hospitalized a couple of days beforehand because they had tried to take their own life. Are there books that can help us just help our kid because we want to support them? We made this door for people like me when I was 16. For Rainbow readers wanting to choose their own adventure, there are now all kinds of happily ever afters. Books are for everybody. That's beautiful. We all need heroes we can look up to, and you can find details on the Alphabet Book Club on our Facebook page.

Bringing a new baby into the world is incredible, but also incredibly challenging. And when it's twins, well, it sounds a lot more challenging. Now imagine those twins also come prematurely and need help just to breathe. Here's Rachel Parkin with a special group of mums who are paying it back. Erated and caffeinated. Flat white and what would you like? You could say this is Playgroup at its classic Kiwi Best. Okay, who's next? Mums and Bub stepping out in Mother Nature. But look closely and there's a difference. Double the cuteness. So we've got Loughlin and Hunter. Ashley and Dulles. This is Tilly and Tini. Sloan and Carter. Baby Noah and her sister Mali. Five beautiful sets of twins full of beans now but rewind to a scary start and teeny tiny bodies hooked up to machines. This gorgeous giggle was 359 days between them in Christchurch hospital's neonatal intensive care. Very, very hard and overwhelming. So my boys were Naku for 94 days. Wow. Yeah. I think you feel very helpless. It was really emotional, just not being able to take your babies home. Our boys were in 100% humidity incubators. They didn't look very good. It was really scary. But during those scary, blurry days, these mamas found each other. And as their babies grew, so did their bond. Life in the trenches, after all, much easier shared. You know, they've shared a similar journey. They get it. Yeah, they get it. Like, I message them all day, every day. From high highs... They're just starting to notice that each other's there. Is that your best friend? Two years, low-lows. It's hard. So hard. But when you look at the boys, that's my why. Then one day... I was literally just out for a walk. And I thought the girls are sleeping. I'm walking. I feel so much about it for getting out. And then I kind of was girls are sleeping, I'm walking. I feel so much better for getting out. And then I kind of was like, right, I've had this idea. Don't shoot me. The mum's hatched a plan to pay it back. A double whammy. She had some pounds and raised dollars for Naku. Between us all, we spent 359 days in Naku. And so our goal was to walk 2Ks because we had two babies every day that we were in Naku so between us all that was 718Ks. Wow that's awesome. That might not sound a big deal if you haven't had children but let me tell you. Getting two babies out of each house for a walk day in and day out for a month is borderline unbelievable. First of all, well done. Thank you. How was that? Yeah, I'm not going to lie, it was really hard. Well done. Thank you. It was really good, to be honest. I always wanted to give back somehow. They are always in need of breast pumps or comfy chairs, I mean everything. And, I mean, they helped us get to where we are today. And that's the point. Those 359 days in NICU while tough to remember, or at least think about, also a time they'll never forget. Yeah, thanks to all the nurses for your kindness and your empathy and for showing love to my two babies. Oh, thank you. It's amazing. The effort that everyone goes to, you know, essentially they're looking after your babies when you can't. And you can't argue with these results. Babies destined it would seem for Playdays for life. And look at them. They're thriving. Amazing moms. It's adorable. Right, the famous face is known for taking care of us when we're gone. But after four top ratings seasons, our beloved cascateers are back with one for the books. Buckle in for some drama, tears and a whole little laughter. Francis and Kayora Tipini entered the funeral business with nothing but passion. But you also got to be able to lift and not do like a pukana, like you've got to lift and oh my goodness me this is so heavy, you know. Now the Altearo's favourite funeral directors. Ah, yeah, my love. And it's that passion that made them global. Altearo's favourite funeral directors. And it's that passion that made them global television stars after Netflix picked up their series, The Cascareteers. Two books, three funeral parlours, four seasons, and five sons later, and they're back for a fifth season. With their team they guide us through unseen elements of Tangihanga. Impacts of COVID-19 while they set up shop in the windy capital and Francis has his own close call with death. The last thing you want to do is prepare for your own loved one's funeral. I've learned a big lesson. Fokaronga to the Rata, they know what they're doing and talking about. And joining us now are the cascateers, Francis and Kayao Tippina. Kiyora and welcome back to the show again. Firstly, how are you, Francis? We're hoping you're okay. Kiyora, Sasha. Kiyore, Madi. Yes, how are you, Francis? We're hoping you're okay. Kiola, Sasha. Kiyo, Madi. Yes, I'm very well now. Thank you. After a little bit of a scare, we had late last year, sorry, early last year. Back to good health now and back at him. Fantastic. We're so pleased to hear it, Francis. And now, season five is kicking off tonight. Can you believe it, five seasons? What were some of your most memorable moments this season? What can people look forward to? You know, COVID is COVID. So, but we try to work through. We open the Puri to a branch. So we go down there. We go on some staff excursions to, you know, a bit of promotion at local retirement villages, you know, not drumming up business, but just letting them know that we're here should they ever, them or their families need us. So, you know, there's a bit of that and and a little bit more of probably some random purchases, you know, my husband and his little getaways. All of a lot of meaning, you know, I don't just buy things to buy things. They mean, they mean lots, they mean, you know, hopefully they do. Hey, and the show's done really well overseas. What kind of feedback do you get from abroad? People are just crying up for more seasons. They want more. Actually, they do. They ring up and ask us if we can go over there and look after them. Yes, and, you know, it excites me. I'm ready to go. I'm like, yep, I'll leave Al-Tairoa to go overseas and do tangi-hanga over there. But, you know, she said no. So I'm going to stay back here and look after our own. Hey, after five seasons, what does this show mean to the two of you? I can't help but express how grateful we are to a lot of Farno who agree to sharing their final journey with us and with the country and now with the world. If the people like the show and want to watch more and learn more of our culture and the way in which we do funerals and Tangianga, then we'll continue to share it. But until then, you know's it's something that we hope invokes corero with fauna and friends you know you don't have to every day but it's just planting that seed there that you know with birth at some time will come death and you two work together you live together you've got five children together and book deals. What's your secret? I still haven't worked that out yet, Sasha, Maddie, but, you know, I think for me it's just listening to her and, you know, not arguing when she says no, just no is no, you know, although I can leave the room and get all grumpy and, you know, pukuriri, but no is no, you know. Although I can leave the room and get it all grumpy and, you know, but it is what it is because in the long run, that no is usually always right. I think he summed it up really well.
