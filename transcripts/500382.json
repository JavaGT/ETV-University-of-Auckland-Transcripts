Remember your service numbers? 638-482. I was a young fellow of about 16 and I went to a friend's place in Hooya Street, Devonport, who was a, they had a cycle club. And I met two nice girls there and I took a fancy to one. She took a fancy to me. But she lived at Pooka Kui. And in those days, we never had the money to get to Pukkahui. But my friend Eric King was a territorial. And he said, we're going there next week for maneuvers. Oh, I said, I'll come around at Naranek and join the army. So I joined the army at Naranek with him. But we didn't go to Pokukawa. We went to Waiwera instead. So I never seen her again since. Didn't get the girl. No, got a gun. Yeah, I got a gun. Yeah, no. In your files in the army, when you get them, they say whether you're clean or whether you're dirty or whether you wash or whether you don't. And all everything. And on the top it had written not to go overseas. So I said, hello, what's here? So I rubbed it out with a pencil. The next month I'll join me mates in Egypt. Why do you think I didn't want you to go away? Good, I was too young. I had my 21st birthday in the war finished. I was going into Trieste to a rest camp because my officer said I'd got two killers through the fighting. I think it was the best time in my life because it stopped me from being with a... I used to knock around a lot of lyricans and boys and I would have been in trouble if I hadn't to join that army I think I would have been in course we only had two or three policemen in those days but that saved me from being a terror way but I would never frightened people say you're a liar if you're not scared. I have been scared in other places. But don't forget Hitler said young soldiers are the best because they know no fear. I never did a lot of training of marching and that sort of thing and all that. I learned about the guns. Well, I knew very well we'd go to Italy but I was kept back in Egypt for a while. I don't know whether they knew my age or what I learned about the guns. Well, I knew very well we'd go to Italy, but I was kept back in Egypt for a while. I don't know whether they knew my age or what, but I kept back, I was doing a bit of cooking for the camp, camp cooking. And then one day I said, just a casino, you're going overseas. That was it. They're going back to Italy. I joined the anti-tank, which I was glad that was a bloody good outfit. And I lost a lot of parents. And I lost one friend straight away since I was in there. He tried on a booby trap and brought the bloody house down and buried him. We never got captured on New Year's Eve. We had to put our gun up with the Marri Battalion and by the German lines. You can see them down in, I think. There was a tank that had been in a tunnel or two tanks, and they'd been shooting down Route 9 and everybody wanted to come up the traffic. They were shooting our way. So we went out round of back and put the gun there and we were going to shoot four shells or five down into that tunnel and go take off the half track there. It's in a book. It's in a history book of the New Zealand Arturi. And what happened was, Sergeant and we had to go out at night from this house where we were in with these infantry boys and go out and do a picket on the gun. Because the Germans were sent out patrols up that way. And this night, in the early hours of morning, it was freezing cold, but no snow. And we were sitting in this ditch in the grapevine and the Maori were in the house behind us and he said to me, my sergeant, Henry Hearn his name was, Hearn, we were chef from here and go on the other side. Well up we get, and we walk over to the other side for another lot of guys from about not four a mile away, just where we can still see our gun. And then all of a sudden, up the grapevine wall, where he'd been sitting, came a German patrol. And he said to me, fire a shot, it might be Maury's. So I thought, oh, I'll,. I pulled the trigger on the Tommy gun. It was so cold the spring didn't have any power to set it off. And so why, wasn't we lucky? So we went back and the next morning we did that. We fired the shells into that tank, and it never fired again. So we got it. We got it. Or two, whatever I think. But I said to the Maori in the little house, we nearly shot you up last night. And they said, why is that? They said, your patrol coming. We were all asleep. Nobody came out. Mowries were hard people to be with. I was attached to them. We were quite a way through. But they were hard. Everything was a joke. You can actually see the German soldiers. No, I don't think I, if I could tell the truth, I don't know if I saw anything I'm firing at, unless I were in a tank. Oh yeah, the whole lot was sitting on the back of a tank and we fired a 17 pounder of of his ass. Anyway, one night we put in an attack, and it's stupid. You disorient us. You know, we had a little six-pounder, and the infantry was ahead of us only from here to there. And somebody come running, I was down by the side of the gunnails, and somebody came running through a cornfield, we're in a corner of a field. And instead of me shooting it, I turn around and said, who goes there? Well, what a stupid thing to say. I couldn't believe it afterwards. So anyway, he disappeared whoever it was, but he's gone back our way. And then the next day, they're all in the hut, after the battle is over, it's all, you know, getting cleaned up. And I was sitting on the back of the half track, we had a half track, having a shave. And I looked over and I couldn't believe it, he was a German holding his rifle up to me. Well, it's a rendering, or? Yeah, and it must have been him. Good I, John. My God! What are you going to do? I can't, I can't, you can't shoot him, because he got his hands up. So all the boys come out and we had to look at him, and he had a pornographic book in his pocket, so that saved him. But another time I got another one. Oh, he'd been shooting at us all night. And, of course, the sergeant's got a bottle of spirits once a month or something on a gun. And the first time old Henry Hearn had given us an epa, his spirits, whatever, a whisker, a general, whatever. This joke, I dropped mine because he'd really hit me. And next morning, he come running down and raised his hands up. After shooting, I said, it's all night. So I said to a man named Stiles here, a bit religious. They do have them in the army. I'm going to shoot this bucket. Whether he likes or not. So when you're close to me, I'll put my gun up to shoot. And he said, you can't do that. You've got his hands up, that's murder. You've got to forget the bad part. If I thought of the bad parts, I'd be nutty now. Give an example of one bad part. Well, that bad part, we nearly got captured by the Germans. Oh, and the brickworks. The brickworks where that man went mad while he went silly. And the bullets were bounced off the shield in front of me from the German Spender. And I've been away, it's all dark, and I've been over in the house. He in there, Māori, Pianakoi, Pianukai, trying to talk Maori, and they're away behind us. Ah, I mean, just down the road was the German, or the Spandau mounted on a tripod, and he pulled a trigger, and the gas would put it that way, and that way, or that way, whatever, pulled it. And I, we were unfortunate to stand in by the gun, and that morning, the bloody tank came down and blew the top off my house. And I'd been up there looking out over to see what was in. I've never seen a tank. And a tiger come down with an 88mm and blew the top off it. And a Maori in the tank was in us. We're all laying on the bottom. Underneath he kept, don't run inside, don't run inside. One joker was so frightened in his brickways to get out big tunnels, you know, chimneys. We found him halfway up to chimney. He could have probably run up the chimney inside it. How the hell do you stop a Tiger tank with an anti-tank gun? Very hard. Underneath? Yeah, well, you've got to hit the soft part. He's got to hit underneath. But then, don't forget, he's firing tracer at you and everything. He clothes could be on fire or anything, you know, with a tracer or if you don't get hit. But, yeah, oh yeah, it's a hard, you know. But they're not, they're not, you know, they're not, you know. I've climbed on top of him and taken the bloody badges off the tank commander and quite so forth. But if they never had troops, where they carried a lot of troops on them, you could go alongside him because they can't see and put a sticky bomb or something on the side and blade a track off. I turned to atrocities. Could I easily look after the Red Cross on our truck? I see a woman walking down the road, the Germans were chasing the refugees down the road, and she was coming down like that. And her father was with her and a brother. And I got over and she sat her down. And I peeled back the front and her breasts were hanging out underneath like a bunch of the grapes. The father had the muscle cut out of his arm and the brother had all his fingers off. I couldn't get out of them really what really had but apparently it worked out by, she said, the Germans was going to shoot her, they raped her, they were going to shoot her and she fainted and instead of a bullet going in that way and went under her breast, and cut a breast wide open. You see that thing with a sailor's hat on it? That's a seven-sided chalice. And that came out of my captain, McNish, presented it to the club here. It went up there and in the top of mine a casino. And then there's a flagstone. And he pulled the flagstone up to the boy, all the two. And it was staircase down and under, right into the ground. And there was all those crystals in there. It wasn't broken after all that bombing and that was what a souvenir he had two of them but the Batman broke one when he's on the piss it's hard to be what was Kisina how the hell do you attack a stronghold like that it's just like the answer it was sheer numbers death Death don't mean anything. Force. But the Poles got there, right up the top. And they got it, but the Germans had left. But the Poles were the first. Yanks, except they were, but they weren't. How the hell did anyone even get out of it alive? Well, never volunteer. Never volunteer. Never volunteer for anything in the Army. As far as I was concerned, to me it was an adventure. I was too young. I was young. It wasn't a hell of it. And it's hard to explain. It would have given anywhere. Fighting went on and was still the last day of the war. went on and we're still the last day of the war. Well, we're not after the last day of the war. Tell us about there with the Yugoslavs. Well, the Yugoslav in Tito came in with his army to Trieste. And Tito wanted Trieste to be included in Yugoslav. Right? So we were up, you know, our position a water place, where all the water came from. I'm standing on one side of the machinery and a big water, you know, what it's like on that east? Atino's standing over there. I'm told you're not allowed to do it. And don't evoke him. And they had all women, and women were rough as guts, long hair and covered in grenades. In fact, they threw one of our joccas down the bloody well. That was the last jacket got killed, I think. And this friend of mine I told her that got captured last, with the raston truck, they took that rasset truck, and they kept driving past us every day of the week while we're up there with our truck, our sign on the side, our diamond. And we couldn't do nothing about it. So when you came home, did it all change? Did you fit in okay? Fantastic. Yeah? Fantastic. Fantastic. Yeah. We went back to my old mum and that. And we never worked for quite a while but then I got a job with the Oistair's Government. And then I finished up working on orangutera for the Navy. Public works there now. And that's then I went and learned a trade at rehab school as a painter and decorator, which I did right up until the day. Until now, I'm 80 bloody 5 now. And I'm just about at it. Would you do it again? Yeah. If I was young, if I was the same age then and come on again, I'd sign up tomorrow. Because I didn't know no fear. Very good, eh? Anything you want to add? I'm going to ask you one last thing. This is called the Last Weaves of War. Anything you want to add? I'm going to ask you one last thing. This is called the Last Weaves of War. Yeah, what I'd like to add, that all those friends of mine are gone, I miss them. All those band of brothers, never mind about the American band of brothers, the Kiwi Banda brothers, I miss them. Remember them all? I remember them all. Yeah. I miss them. We all had good times and bad. Never volunteer."}
