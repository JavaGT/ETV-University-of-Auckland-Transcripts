I'm Bernardine Oliver Kirby. You're with AM early. Jacinda Adirn has this morning met with Joe Biden. The US president welcomed her to the White House and called her a good friend. In their first face-to-face encounter, the pair met in the Oval Office and discussed shared concerns, including the Pacific gun laws and online violent extremism. Biden started by flattering the Prime Minister, calling her leadership on global issues critical and something he'd like to work on. Galvin I have an action on climate change, a global effort of crime of violence, extremism and online like happened at Christchurch, Nicole. And, you know, we want to be, I want to work with you on that effort. The 90-minute meeting rang longer than scheduled. Jacinda O'Durn told media afterwards that the conversation showed how strong the relationship between New Zealand and the US is. There's nothing quite like meeting face to face. We were due to sit down, I believe, for just under an hour, and I believe we tipped into an hour and a half. And I think that is a demonstration of the warmth of the relationship, the common ground, a little bit of shared Irish heritage. But ultimately the fact that between us, we have shared challenges, but we also see opportunities. House prices are continuing to fall with some signs fiscal policy and increasing interest rates are having an effect. Prices dropped nationally by 0.8% in May, however, the average property value still sets well over $1 million. Cool logics Nick Goodall says from Christchurch, aside from Christchurch, all main centres are seeing a persistent decline in house prices. The quarterly decrease of by 0.9% is the biggest drop in a three-month period since 2010. As China's tour of the Pacific continues, a senior Labour minister is heading to Fiji to meet with several government officials. Associate Foreign Affairs Minister, Opito William Se Labor minister is heading to Fiji to meet with several government officials. Associate Foreign Affairs Minister Opito William Seo will travel to Fiji today for a four-day trip where he'll meet with Pacific Marine Ministers as well as the country's health minister. It comes hot on the hills of a visit to the country by a delegation from China who signed a cooperation agreement with the nation. The delegation has since met with Tongan officials and is due in Vanuatu today. A major blow for Russia as one of its biggest oil deals gets the chop. Germany has made the decision to stop all oil imports from Russia by year's end. It follows Tuesday's announcement that the European Union will cut 90% of Russian oil imports into its 27 member states. German Chancellor Olaf Schultz says while it's a good step, he's seeking full energy independence. For us, and by the way, the same also applies to the Polish government. Irrespective of this decision, we'll continue our efforts to stop all Russian oil imports by the end of the year. It comes amidst continued Russian airstrikes in Ukraine's east. It's understood residents have been forced to flee Sloviansk in the wake of rocket fire overnight. Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Texas as the country's gun reform debate reaches fever pitch. The National Rifle Association is holding a convention just days after 19 children were shot dead at a nearby school. Victim's families have rallied behind the protest group posting support on social media. The NRA's lobbying efforts to veto gun laws is the latest focus of public outcry. The Yuvaldi Massacre is the 19th mass shooting in Texas alone this year. In sport, the host for next week's A&Z Premiership Grand Final will be determined by whoever comes out on top in the Northern Mystic Central Pulse Showdown on Friday. After a satisfying win over tactics in Christchurch, the Pulse have now extended their winning run to three games and favourites to secure top place in the standings. The Mystics will be without five players due to COVID and injuries, but despite the odds being stacked against them, Skipper Sulu Fitzpatrick remains bullish about their chances. It's been a lot of narrative and focus on what we don't have, but I believe in what we have here. And I believe in that the only way we're going to do it is together and I back each and every one of our players A short-handed and inexperienced black sticks have struggled against Australia going down 8-1 in the opening match of the Trans-Tasman series with eight key players unavailable the Kiwis found themselves outclassed by the pace and the quality of the Cucobarra's attack. Started well for the home side with Defender David Bryden's scoring first, finding himself open in the inner circle before slotting at home to put New Zealand up 1-0. But it was all downhill from there with Australia's scoring three in quick succession for adding five more after half-time to go 1-0 up in the series. Can I only get better, lads.

In international news, Germany is sticking to its goal of being reliant on Russian oil by the end of the year, or not reliant on the end of the year. For more on this, AM Europe reporter Elizabeth White joins us. Elizabeth, this is a huge call from Germany. They were so determined to refrain from any oil sanctions against Russia. They were running scared initially. They've now drawn a line in the sand and it's in about turn. Yeah, so a complete flip from Germany. And actually, it's just huge news for the EU in general. So essentially what they've come to an agreement on is banning 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of this year. So not only is that like a huge move to ban almost all of it, but to ban it by the end of the year. You know, we're in June now. We're halfway through the year. So this is going to be a fast-moving project, I believe. And yes, you know, it has been a really contentious issue here in Germany since the Russia invaded Ukraine. You know, as we know, this cutting of Russian oil is a direct result of Russia's invasion in Ukraine. So it's essentially they're you standing in solidarity with Ukraine and basically saying we condemn all actions by Russia at this point. But Germany, of course, like you said, really on the fence about it for a long time. You know, Germany takes a lot of its oil from Russia. You know, they don't have an alternative source as to where more of it would have come from. So they were really on the fence about it, trying to play it really safe. And Ukraine actually condemned Germany for it back when the war first broke out and said, we kind of don't want you visiting. We don't want you to kind of show your support when you're still kind of financing Russia's war machine. So essentially what we're going to see is a huge cutoff, a huge source of financing for Russia's war games completely cut off. And, you know, this doesn't come without debate. Hungary was also really on the fence about this. They take more than half of all their oil, 65% of it from Russia. So they, like Germany, were really on the fence about, you know, what's our alternative, but they have come to an agreement with the rest of the EU to cut that off. So, you know, this is really going to hit Russia where it hurts. EU takes one third of all of its Russia and oil imports, sorry, a third of all of its oil imports from Russia. So this is really going to hurt Russia financially. And, you know, it's going to say to them we're not going to fund your war game. It's also going to hurt Germans. This has just been announced, but you can't imagine it's going to be popular with everyone because what that's going to mean is high prices at the pump and all round for Germans. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, since I came to Germany, I've seen oil, I've got a car here, I've seen oil prices go from kind of one euro 50 to well over €2.50. So it's a huge, huge increase. And to fill up my car now is really expensive. It's really going to hurt everyone in the pocket. You know, Germany for a long time has been trying to push the electric car thing, but Germans love their cars. You know, we have Mercedes, we have Porsche. And here in Stuttgart, Mercedes and Porsche, Audi, BMW, people love their cars. They don't want to give it up. And, yeah, it is going to really be very costly for Germans everywhere. And that's going to be interesting right on the back of news of record inflation in the Eurozone. So the hurt will continue. Yeah, that's right. So oil is not the only thing that is soaring. So the Eurozone has seen the highest inflation rate since records began back in 1997. So for May, we're looking at 8.1% increase. And that's up on April's huge 7.4% increase. So it is really huge, and this is obviously a direct result of the Russia invasion of Ukraine. But it's also a run-on effect from the coronavirus pandemic. There has been supply chain issues for a long time now. So this has been kind of a big snowball that's been building, but obviously is being made worse by Russia's invasion on Ukraine. I guess for some comparison for you guys in New Zealand, what we've seen is, you know, energy prices are the big one. That's gone up by 40%. Things like cars, appliances, books, they're up by 4%. So not as big, but still seeing that big increase. But I guess one of the main ones is food prices. That's gone up by almost 8%. And you can see it when you go to supermarkets. Now, you know, not only a shelf is wiped out because people are worried about the increasing cost on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, but you can also see prices just kind of going through the roof at the moment. And Germany was also always a very kind of cheap country to live, but it's kind of raising a question of how long is that going to last for. New Zealanders certainly feel that pain at the supermarket for sure. Let's head back to Germany and question of how long is that going to last for? New Zealanders certainly feel that pain at the supermarket for sure. Let's head back to Germany and kitty cat lovers. They're going to get to spend more quality time with their feline friends? Yeah, well, I have a tale for you. Essentially, poor patrol is coming to Germany, so there's a little town in the region where I live in Baden Buttenberg called Waldorf and essentially they're putting a ban on cats being outside over the summer months for the next three years. So this is a really strange rule. It's a very kind of, I think, German thing to do. But it's essentially because they have this very special kind of bird called a crest of lark. And they're extremely endangered. There are only six left in the region. And essentially, cats like to eat them. So they've said, you know, the birds come out in summer. We don't want cats eating them, so please keep your cats inside. And they're not allowed out. And basically, if your cat is seen roaming around where it shouldn't be, 500 euro fine, if your cat eats one of the birds, 50,000 euro fine. Wow. So it is really strict and it is really harsh. But I guess the local authorities are just trying to avoid a catastrophe. Gareth Morgan will be loving this idea. Let's hope he's not watching. He'll fire up the debate again.

As unemployment remains low in many businesses are as busy as ever, what might be driving this potential recession? Infometrics, principal economist Brad Olson joins me now to explain. Good morning to you, Brad, recession. It's a scary word, very hard to put a positive spin on it, how likely that we will face one of sorts and what's triggering it or likely to trigger it? Well, a recession does seem somewhat inevitable for the New Zealand economy and the hope really at the moment has to be that it is a short, sharp recession and that we don't see that economic scarring, a long-term hit that we usually associate with recessions. You're right that at the moment the labour market is strong. We've got a lot of people in employment and that gives us a really strong buffer. And of course, the economy has a lot of momentum over the last few years. We've been able to power out of our various lockdowns and come through things pretty well, all things considered, certainly a lot better than the rest of the world. The worry though at the moment is that we do still look like we're pushing the economy to an extreme and we could well find ourselves with that recession, not because we're down in the doldrums and economic activity has completely plummeted. It just might be that we find it really difficult to grow further with lots of price increases, a difficulty finding materials and workers, all meaning that we're having to import a lot more and that the domestic economy here in New Zealand can't grow all that much further. So we know there's a cost of living crisis. Is spending down though? We've actually said at the moment that spending is very so slightly up on pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Now of course, once you take into account inflation, the underlying amount of spending going through the economy isn't buying us nearly as much. But it's important to note that those slightly better than 2019 figures come at a time when households and businesses are telling us that they are at some of their most pessimistic levels are on record. And so there is quite a difference there. It says that at the moment people think that the future is going to be tough, that there are some real difficulties coming up. But at the moment, there's actually enough confidence to keep going. A looming threat, really, of just how challenging things are going to become, not only with inflation, but also with interest rates and similar starting to move higher. Realistically, the economy is trying to do more work than we have the materials and people to do, and that's what's driving inflation. But it's also basically saying that the New Zealand economy motor, if you will, is running without oil and there's only for so long that we can run the motor hot before we burn it out. And so the feeling is that before that time or approaching that point, that's where you could have a short sharp recession. The question now is if we get to that point how quickly we can power out the other side. Yeah, because I guess the Reserve Bank wants to curb spending, but businesses are going to struggle. If people aren't spending, couple that with serious labour shortages, supply issues. It's almost like it's long COVID for business. It does feel incredibly challenging. And I think, you know, everyone talks about a soft landing, how you want to somehow bring the amount of work happening in the economy down a touch so it's more stable, it's able to be resourced, but not so much that, like you say, business has hurt, people feel like there's not enough work to go around and there's not enough money to keep fueling activity. So the feeling at the moment is that, look, soft landings are very much what you want to focus on, but seldom do we actually ever get that. We don't want to have that hard crash landing where the economy really does stall. I think what you're seeing realistically going forward is that given people are very much downbeat about the future, but happy enough about the present, it's just that looming threat that we're starting to hit the ceiling a little bit. We're going to bounce around that because we just simply don't have the people. We don't have the resources to grow all that much more. That could lead to a technical recession, but it's certainly not 2008-09 again. We're not back into the GFC. We're not into a Great Depression 2.0. But we are really struggling to grow. Yeah, the plane is in a holding pattern for now, isn't it? Infometrics, principal economist Brad Alson. Lovely to chant. Time now to check in with our reporters around the country and first of all it is good morning to Tia McDougal in Wellington. Talao for Lava Tia. No sparkle in Matariki. What's happening? Yeah, Tola falava, Bernadine, good morning. It is less than a month away from Matariki now, the new public holiday to celebrate the Māori New Year and celebrations of well and truly getting planned. The Matriki Advisory Group, however, advised many councils and cities around the country that fireworks isn't really best suited for Matriki. It's supposed to be a celebration of the stars, and people should be looking up at the stars and not at fireworks. Plus, Matriki is a Māori celebration, so Māori are really into their environment, and fireworks often cause debris to fall down into the ocean. So it just doesn't really suit with Matriki. However, the Wellington City Council is full steam ahead. They've got a $190,000 fireworks display planned, ready for Matriki in less than a month. So it's causing a bit of controversy around here in Wellington. The local Iwi of Teatiawa and Gatitoa are actually going to go to the council and talk to them about potentially coming up with another plan. I'm sure there's you and I could think of many of cool things that could be planned instead. So it'll be a bit of an interesting one to see what happens down here in Wellington on that day, what celebrations will go ahead. But it's set to be a really cool day and it's less than a month away. It will be, but I can't imagine too many ratepayers would be thrilled about that. I know the pet lovers would love no fireworks, that's for sure. Thanks for that to you. Let's head to Auckland, Jasmine Ning this morning. Jasmine, I love visiting the zoo. It's quite pricey to go. I think it's worth it. But people are visiting and getting hit in the pocket even further. Yes, well, Bernardine. Concern concerns have been raised over proposed, well, parking. That's going to be introduced at the Auckland Zoo and the Museum of Transport and Technology. So once this new car park, which is being built outside Motat, which should be completed around mid-July, parking will cost $2 per hour and then capped at $8 at both car parks. So the money will go towards maintaining the car parks with any surplus to go directly to the zoo or Motet. However, residents in the area are concerned that this cost will just be too expensive for some families. With admission to both places, already costly enough as it is. So a family pass at the zoo is $65, while a family pass at Motat is $45. So once this parking is introduced, around mid-July, they're just concerns that some families just won't go to either places, just with it being too expensive. Yeah, I can totally understand that. And as I said, the zoo is worth it. It's a fabulous place. I don't want to kind of knock on their pricing, but yeah, it's almost like a little bit of insult to injury during the car park. And thanks for that, Jasmine. Let's head to Mitch Redmond in Christchurch now, Ottaahi, and tell us about this big development that's proposed, Mitch. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. The Southland economy is set to get a massive boost, with Culles Stewart announcing plans for one of Australasia's largest industrial projects. Now, the construction firm has secured more than 500 hectares of land, just 10 kilometres out of Invercagal near Auroa, which they are planning on developing in the future. Now, Kuala Stewart is claiming the size and scale of this project will be unlike anything ever seen in New Zealand, and the development will become a flagship for economic growth in the south. Now with the Tywy Point aluminium smelt is set to scale down operations within the next couple of years, there is hope that this new development will provide plenty of job opportunities. It is still a little bit murky on when this project will get up and running, but Calder Stewart is expecting plenty of national and international interest. Thanks for that, Mitch. Thanks to our reporters around the motto. That was AM Early Time now, 2 minutes to 6."}
