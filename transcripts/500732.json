Investigators confirmed the victim rammed a police car before being fatally shot and reveal new details of the incident. Ukrainian fighters hold out in Maripol as Russia bombards cities across the country. It's a desperate scramble for cover as the bombs rained down on residential areas. And the Pope calls for peace in Ukraine, condemning the conflict as cruel and senseless. Tens of thousands flock to St Peter's Square to hear his Easter message for the first time since the pandemic began. Hiro, good evening. Police say a man killed by officers in New Plymouth on Saturday had rammed a police car before being shot. He's been named as 22-year-old Chaos Price. Apart from those details, police are remaining tight-lipped about exactly what happened, saying the incident is under investigation. Kristen Hall reports. A battered police car being towed from the scene where Chaos Price was fatally shot on Saturday night. Police say he was driving in convoy with an associate who was pulled over by officers. While the vehicle stop of the associate's car was being carried out, Mr Price has driven past and then turned back and rammed the stationary marked police car. Police won't reveal whether Price was armed, saying the incident is under investigation. So a firearm does not have to be shown or used against police for them to use a firearm. It is a method to overcome the force against them. Police have shot and killed 40 people since 1990, including two others in the Waitara region. Local man Alan Rowe was shot in 2020 after pointing a rifle at police. Last year, the Crown was ordered to pay $130,000 to the family of Waitara man, Stephen Wallace, who was killed in 2000. If police do end up being armed or having some other form of tactic, I think body cameras should be included with that. It doesn't stop violence at the time, but it's a great investigative tool, and it may be that one step prior to going to lethal weapons. Price was convicted last year on a range of charges, including reckless driving, theft and escaping custody. On a sentencing appeal, the judge said he'd had a transient and chaotic family life and sentenced him to 23 months with leave to apply for home detention. Family members have shared tributes online today and expressed anger at the police. A relative telling one news, officers have covered up information but wouldn't elaborate. This situation was incredibly dynamic. Our officers were dealing with a situation that they needed to take control of. The police cordon on State Highway 3 was lifted late this afternoon after other vehicles involved in the incident were towed out. It's sad and a wee bit uneasy that it's happened so close to home and hopefully it's not going to become something that is a regular occurrence. Three separate inquiries are now underway with a family left grieving. Kristen Hall, One News. And another firearms incident got the day off to a frightening start for some West Auckland residents. A 28-year-olds in custody for pointing a gun at police and firing three random shots. Here's Nicole Bremner. By the time daylight arrived, careful forensic analysis was underway at the Massey House down the steep driveway where the shooting took place. One neighbour woken by a phone call from police around 2am, warning of potential danger. There's an incident that they might have to evacuate us and just to keep alert, I guess, turn the lights off. A few doors down the cul-de-sac, this man woke to the sound of a chopper hovering overhead. Just knew straight away saying it was up because I heard a gunshot and I was like, yeah, something's going on down the assumption of stay inside. Police say a firearm was pointed at arriving officers and three shots fired randomly. A man's in custody facing a range of charges. Some residents have told us this is a quiet neighbourhood and they were surprised when they woke this morning to find a police presence here. But others say this area has gradually changed over the years and they now believe there's more crime. Some say they're still on edge after the death of Constable Matthew Hunt gunned down on duty on Amassie Street in June 2020. Now was that cop that got shot, that got killed a couple years ago. So I suppose that's sort of fresh on everyone's minds. And last February, armed police swarmed the suburb again, protecting residents amid reports of an armed altercation. That was pretty bad because my mum's house just up the road from there and I got worried about that because I was at work. The man charged over the latest incident will make a second court appearance late tomorrow afternoon. Nicole Bremna, One News. And you can find extra coverage of the latest firearms incidents. That's on our website 1ews.co.com. Now to Ukraine and the last stand of Maripal. Ukrainian soldiers hold up near a factory have ignored a Russian ultimatum to surrender and the country's second largest city Harkiv continues to be pounded by Russian artillery. Simon Mersep has the latest. Somewhere at this steel plant they're refusing to surrender. Russian artillery. Simon Mersip has the latest. Somewhere at this steel plant, they're refusing to surrender. Russian forces encircle perhaps hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers. After weeks of fighting, Maripol is largely in Moscow's control. Russia has plenty of firepower to call on, but Ukraine will not concede the city. No, city still is not falling. There is still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight till the end. And as for now, they still are in medieval. But how long can they last? They have no water, no food, no heat, no electricity. The Russians do have supplies and experience. Our guys are battle-hardened Syrian veterans, this Russian soldier says. They suppress enemy firing positions. This is what they're fighting for, a city where the dead share roads with the living. Some locals get out with Russian help. This family wanted to move to Russian-controlled areas further east and stay with relatives there. So here on the southeast coast is Mariupol, surrounded by Russian forces. Now, in the last few days, Russia has also hit hard in Kharkif to the north. It's Ukraine's second largest city and close to the Russian border. But unlike Mariupol, it has yet to be cut off from the rest of the country. But in Kharkiv, targeted by Russian artillery, tending to the wounded is dangerous. Eventually, they emerged, they emerged to scramble the wounded away. At least five are reported killed in this latest shelling of Kharkiv. Capturing this city would be a huge victory for Russia. But listen to the resolve in the voice of the mayor, calling on locals not to be intimidated. Russia's attacks may have been spurred by the loss of its flagship for Moscow a couple of days ago. Today, this image was posted online. It's unverified but claims to be the Moscow. Simon Mersep, one news. As Russia focuses its war effort on eastern Ukraine, people still living there are preparing for a major onslaught. Many staying put on the elderly. BBC correspondent Clivemirey visited the village of Sjahjvka near Donetsk to meet some of those refusing to leave everything they know. The Ukrainian military are on the move in defence of the homeland. The landscape flat, open country, perfect for heavy armour, as Russia is to seize the Donbas region. The road signs, proving useless guides by design. It's mid-morning in the village of Serjivka. Is that for the sleeve? And our presence piques the interest of the local territorial defence force. An army of volunteers ready for the Russians. Maxim Laskovets is 26, and a local commander, born and bred in the village. Are you worried that the Russians are gonna come here? We will be ready to greet the Russians, he tells me. They came to us with weapons, not the other way around. We live in Ukraine. This is our land. Donbass is the Ukraine. And I was born in Ukraine. And I will die in Ukraine. So many have left the village since the start of the war. A population of 1,400 is now down to just 300, and the vast majority who remain are elderly, clinging on to what they know. Valeri Duhlni is head of the local municipality. He's watched his village leach its young since Russia invaded Ukraine, but he understands why many older residents want to stay. They're afraid to leave their houses and households behind, he tells me. It's hard to go. Raisa Horislavitz is one of the villagers who chose not to leave. Raisa Clive. The great absence in her life is her own sister, who lives in Donetsk, closer to the Russian border. Her sister doesn't believe Russia has committed war crimes in this conflict, and she believes the invasion is just. At the moment, I'm not in touch with her due to political reasons we didn't find common ground. The local cherry blossom heralds the onset of spring. But no one's under any illusions that winter is coming. To the village of Serhivka, right across eastern Ukraine. And as the situation in Ukraine continues to unfold, say across the latest developments on our website and our other digital platforms. Ukraine's been front and centre of Easter services around the world, with the Pope calling for peace and referring to an Easter of war. Crowds return for the first time in two years to the Catholic Church's spiritual home. Joy Reid looks at how people remembered the most important date in the Christian calendar. For the first time since the pandemic began, tradition descended on the Vatican. 50,000 pilgrims flocking to St Peter's Square for Easter Mass. The joyous scenes in contrast to the theme of the Pope's speech, calling it an Easter of war. We have seen all too much blood, all too much violence. The 85-year-old Catholic leader has been suffering with a sore leg in recent months, limping to the balcony and remembering nations at war, including Ukraine, implicitly criticising Russia for dragging the country into a cruel and senseless war. On this terrible night of suffering and death, may a new dawn of hope soon arise. Let there be a decision for peace. May there be an end to the flexing of muscles while people are suffering. Happy Easter to all of you. Appeals for peace too in London by the leader of the Anglican Church calling on Russia to commit to a ceasefire. In the absence of the Queen, the Royals were led to their traditional Easter Sunday service by Prince William and family. In his written Easter message, Prince Charles said he was heartbroken at the sufferings of innocent victims of conflict. Meanwhile, in Ukraine's capital, despite warnings not to go out, some Orthodox worshippers braved the streets to mark the start of their holy week. My children were afraid about me coming here today, but I didn't tell them, and I came, I came using back the streets. The war-torn residents praying for victory. If there is no victory, there is no peace. Peace, the resounding hope. On the day the world remembers the ultimate hope of Easter Sunday 2,000 years ago. Do we read, one news? Back here, budgeting services are calling for more government support as the increasing cost of living puts pressure on demand. Many face losing the extra funding given during the pandemic, even though more people are turning to them for help. Our Hawks Bay reporter, Henry McMullen, has more. It's breakfast time in this flex-mear household. We're all on clockwork here, eh? We've got to be on clockwork. Josie Ann is a solo mum looking after her kids, grandchildren and mother. She works full-time shift work 40 hours a week, picking up extra work when she can. The time with family is hard, especially when most of your time is put into work to provide for your family. The only sole income earner in the home. It's been hard at times to put cereal on the table, but they're getting by, thanks to some financial advice. I need to be working. Being on a benefit just won't cut it from most families. When you've got rent, power, food, petrol, the cost of living is skyrocketed. Budget First Hastings is one of many free financial advice services to see a steep rise in new clients over the recent months. What we see now is the growth in clients that are earning between 50k and 70K. But the increasing need comes as budgeting services faced losing additional funding as they got through COVID. We've seen an additional 10 to 20% of clients over the next year. And we're going to not be able to keep the number of staff that we currently have to meet that demand. Many budgeting services have written letters like this one to the minister calling it a cost of living crisis and pleading to keep their funding. I have been made aware of some of the pressures that are on budgeting services and recognise the importance of the role that they are playing and I'm certainly cognisant of some of the funding demands out there. For those living day-to-day like Josian, it's love for Farno that gets them by. They are my why. They are the reason why I do what I do. So, yeah, know your why and everything else should just fall into place. The group supporting families like hers also hoping for some clarity on their future. Henry McMullen, One News.

Noamaya Arnold, a Wellington social studies teacher who allegedly asked students where the land should be returned to Māori has left one mother reeling. Resolution talks are ongoing, but the situation adds to growing concerns the new history curriculum could create hostile learning environments if it isn't delivered well. Mardi Affairs reporter T'A'anui reports. This mother of two was stunned to learn about her teenage son's recent experience in a social studies class. The teacher had posed a question on an online cahoot quiz, and the question was whether a lad should be returned to Māori, which was a yes or no question, very close question without any kind of context to it. My son did feel really unsettled. He felt isolated in the class and he felt that he had to speak up for everybody for Māori and take on that burden by himself. She doesn't want to identify the school school which she says disputes what happened, but it has agreed to meet and take another look at the lesson. When you fail to acknowledge bias and privilege in a loaded question as such without offering any contextual understanding it creates a completely unsafe environment for the few Māori my son included in their class. There's growing concerns situations like these that leave students feeling vulnerable could become a lot more common when the new history curriculum is rolled out next year, particularly for Māori. Their ancestors were evicted essentially from their lands, which were taken from them. That would be one example where it could be quite distressing. The potential is there for some of the difficult histories to land with students in a way that generates feelings of guilt, shame, blame, anger. The History Teachers Association is putting together guidelines to help teachers deliver the curriculum safely. Its work, the Fangare-based organisation Haar, has been front-footing, educating Northland teachers about local histories through art. For me, a culturally safe learning environment looks like a place that honours emotion and allows learners to transform that into change. She's worried some teachers could weaponise the content if they haven't had time to grapple with it themselves. If they don't have the opportunity to safely engage in our history in a way that helps them navigate their emotions, then they will perpetuate their biases in the classroom and with our history. In a statement, the Ministry of Education says it's developing resources to support student well-being while studying the new curriculum, which will be ready by term three of this year. That's reassuring for this mother. I want to know that it's not going to happen again and that there are specific action plans in place to make sure that the teachers are doing their own self-reflection. A message for teachers ahead of what some call one of the biggest curriculum shake-ups of our generation. Tianiwa Huri Hanganui, One News. COVID breath tests have been given emergency authorization in the US as the country closes in on one million COVID deaths. There are hopes all lead to similar technology being developed down under. Channel 9's Michael Genevese has more. It's taken two years to get from this to this, a COVID breath test. No nasal swabs, just a single-use straw, with results in less than three minutes. The technology is the work of Texas company InspectIR systems. It reads the chemical compounds associated with COVID-19. Studies show that for people with COVID, it's around 91% accurate. And so they want you to follow up with a PCR test if it gets positive. If it's negative, it's a little over 99% accurate. And so they want you to follow up with a PCR test if it gets positive. If it's negative, it's a little over 99% accurate. And so they're saying as long as you don't have symptoms and you don't think it's full COVID, then you can go ahead and rely on a negativity test. Nearly one million Americans have died from COVID-19. The double dose vaccination rate has stalled at 66%. Mass testing is now considered vital, but it's not cheap. To lease one of these new devices for a month, it'll cost around $40,000. They're suitable only for large-scale workplaces, like hospitals and nursing homes. Hot on its heels, an Australian-made COVID breathaliser, promising close to 100% accuracy and an even faster turnaround. Colin Hickey built his prototype on the Sunshine Coast and is now working with the University of Utah, also hoping for US government approval. And back here, Canterbury University researchers have been working on their own COVID-Breath testing studies. One of the world's worst invasive species, the yellow crazy ant, is driving North Queensland residents to despair. After plaguing Kearns for years, the large ants have moved south to Townsville, forcing local residents to respond. Here's ABC's Michael Schlesack. Go hi! Samantha Kukutsa's yard is full of play equipment, but recently using it can be a nuisance. They're getting little bites from them. When the kids play outside in the yard, and they head in for a bath. Sometimes there's ants in the bath that come off the kids. The problem for Samantha and her kids happens to be one of the world's worst invasive species, a small acid spitting ant called the yellow crazy ant. They've multiplied. I think we've gone from a couple to millions. Up the road, Vaughan and Yvonne are too frail to do much about their infestation and live with them all through the house. It looks like the ants are crawling right up onto your feet here. Yeah, they will. They'll crawl right up onto you. They'll come in up the front steps into the house. You'd hate a prospective buyer to come in and, oh yeah, well, what's all these ants? While most ant species have separate nests, each with only one queen, yellow crazy ant nests can have an unlimited number of queens, each producing babies. They basically cooperate as one massive nest that can cover tens to even hundreds of hectares. And so, you know, you're like crazy ants almost the perfect storm of a species. It impacts on humans. Councillor Mori Sores says the municipality needs about $9 million of funding to buy baits and hire the people and helicopters needed to treat the area. If we can get that sort of money, we can give it a red-hot show. I'm getting rid of it. Have an infestation on your property. For the moment, residents are taking matters into their own hands with the help of an environmental charity called the Invasive Species Council. They will literally wipe out insect species, small reptiles, ground-dwelling birds and then work their way through and collapse the ecosystem from the bottom up. The charity is helping locals apply bait to their properties and lobbying state and federal governments for more funding. Oh, makes you a bit of tea, doesn't it?

Anay-N-Rourri-ha, welcome Welcome to sport tonight and how's this for grit and determination? Squash Star. Joelle King has been pushed to the wall at the Manchester Open. She's overcome injury and a fierce opponent in a five-game thriller just to make the final. It continues the great run we're having at the moment in the sport of squash. Joelle King, with a a leg strain took on Belgium's Naylor Gillis, partner of men's world number one, Paul Cole. Gillis has ranked 12 in the world, King number five. The Belgian's movement though in speed helping her to long rallies, deft drop shots and a two game to one lead. That's a wonderful line. That's perfect squash. Gillis seemingly on track for her first ever win over the New Zealander. Fourth game, nine all crucial points. King just hanging on with their injury before coming through with some clutch shots. Oh, so tight. Fifth and deciding game in epic. Six all at one stage, then nine all before King gained the first match ball. Positioning, very deep in the corks, it's going to the back. Down, she's made the error, that is unbelievable. To a tie break must win by two tensions rising as Gillis held match ball. Video referee decision on the King appear. Goodness me, this is huge. A stroke and point given to Joelle King. Two more match balls than at 1413, the clincher. Down. Oh, she makes the error. She makes the error. King's done it. In the heat of a battle, things get said and you're asking for lets at pressure moments, and I questioned her trying to play the ball, and she was just a bit disappointed that I questioned it, which is only fair. It was a seesaw. One of us would get in front. The other one would come back, and that's what you want to see in a semi-final, right? You don't want it. A good way to win over a crowd. She'll need them, taking on England's top seed Sarah Jane Perry in tonight's final. It's being confirmed in rather bizarre fashion, but Kiwi pro cyclist Patrick Bevan has scored the biggest win of his career. The eighth and final stage of the tour of Turkey was neutralised and then cancelled. Riders meandering to the finish in Istanbul. Know how they feel. With Bevan essentially gifted the tour win in the end anyway. Here's Guy Velt. Patrick Bevan gets the overall success. A trophy to savour for Patrick Bevan. I've had some nice second places and nice results on stages, but it is my first GC win, so it's really nice. And one that, for the last day day at least essentially fell into his lap, an effortless and low-key ride through the streets of Istanbul, Bevan able to take in all the city's famous sites without a care in the world. Well there he is the overall race leader make that race winner. An early crash in the final stage eight seeing any competitive element taken out of the ride. The stage effectively cancelled with Bevan on a procession to his triumph. The riders kind of came together with the commissers to be like, look, we can't race. There's no way to safely race and it's disappointing. You feel sorry for the Tour of Turkey. A tour that Bevan will now always remember set up with his excellent win on stage 7. He's got the race lead and he's got the 7th stage. His official general classification margin of victory 20 seconds. Setting up a potentially big year for the Kiwi rider. Guy Havalt 1 News. It's big things ahead. Well, the men's sevens team has finished a lowly sixth at the World Series tournament in Vancouver. Wait for it after losing to Australia in the quarterfinals. This despite New Zealand being up 12-0 at one stage, and with a one-man advantage, the Australians fought back to have one last shot late in the match. They'd open up for him. They've got space too low-way. Corey Tool in the corner They converted the try from Out Wide The 1912 win Australia's first victory over their Trans-Tasman rivals in the last 10 matches New Zealand went on to lose to South Africa in the playoff for fifth again after leading until the last minute Murphy on the end goes in up Murphy's in the corner. James Murphy. And what do you know? Argentina have won the Vancouver final, upsetting and underdone Fijian team, 2910. It's their first World Series tournament title in nearly 14 years and over 100 of each. Argentina now second on the points table just behind South Africa, with three tournaments left to play. We've heard your concerns about the treatment of the warriors by NRL referees and the bunker in their loss to the roosters. So today we've had Matt Manukia launch an investigation. He went through every minute of the game with a fine-tooth comb. Here's his report. A one-news investigation can see why Warriors fans have taken to keyboards across the country to vent over those dubious calls in Sydney. A lot of people would have thought that might have been a sin bid. Once he's not a professional power. Yeah, he's stripped it out of his hands by the look of it. There's no intent to strip by the roosters. Rees Walsh loses the ball on the field of play. We have a decision. Little hand in there from Brighton. That's a penalty. There's no intent to be stripped by Angus Triton. The challenge is unsuccessful. He's off the ball out of his hands. It'll be really interesting to see what Nathan Brown has to say in the press conference. That decision was one of those 50-50 ones. Although there is a theory in the NRL that not all teams get those 50-50 ones although there is a theory in the NRL that not all teams get those 50-50 calls it's about us as a club not being one of the big clubs and not getting anything if they're 50-50s make them 50-50s give us a couple give them a couple we're happy if we ever think we're going to get to the point where there's not going to be errors made on the field by the players or officials it's just not going to happen the Warriors actually won the first half penalty count five one the point where there's not going to be errors made on the field by either players or officials. It's just not going to happen. The Warriors actually won the first half penalty count, 5-1, but wasted so many opportunities they only led by two at the break and were told to be better in the second half. We're saying the right things, but when you don't come out and back it up, what's the point? He's talking about errors, some which led directly to Rooster's points. Some easy tries, one on the left edge there with me, Sammy Walker, was really disappointing. The final penalty count favouring the roosters by just one. They capitalised on theirs and the debate is on whether the warriors were stopped from doing the same. The referee is not why we're sitting there on the losing side. We've got some things we need to worry about ourselves. Lots of work on, man, that's for sure. There may be another apology from the NRL, but as always, it'll be too late. Matt Manukia, One News. There's nothing quite like the NBA basketball finals for creating moments of magic. And this morning's first round game between Boston and Brooklyn provided just that. Better yet, it was only game one of the series. Kimberly Downs has today's buzzer beating play. When the garden erupts like this, you know the reason's got to be good. Let's wind it back for the last few seconds. The Celtics are at home, down one. They have a time out, but their coach trusts them. Jason Tatum gets the ball with 1.4 seconds on the clock. Oh! Layup at the buzz of Jason Tatum! Yes, indeed. A layup, wow. I made a layup, that's all. It was just a layup. A layup captured from the court side to the nosebleeds. That happened to be the seventh game winner in Celtics' playoff history and Tatum's first and only field goal in the fourth quarter. It's incredible. A lot to digest, but it's a big time win. A one-point win in a game one that was the definition of a thriller, NBA Twitter reacting accordingly while Tatum took it all in. You know what? We'd want a hug from mum after that effort too. As for the Nets, well, in the garden star Kyrie Irving once called home, a few birds were found nesting. Embrace it, it's the dark side embrace it. A hint perhaps that the Empire will be ready to strike back in game two. Kimberley Downs, one news. Yes, plenty more excitement to come. Well, Chelsea have won through to their third straight FAA Cup final. After beating Crystal Palace at Wembley, it means another trophy showdown against Liverpool following their epic League cup loss in February. Here's the BBC's Matt Gravelling. This March to the Arch was a short one. And all London semi-finals saw fans from the West walk Wembley Way with fans from the South. Palace have never won the Cup, but their manager has four times. And Vieira's side came out strongly, Coyarte with the chance of the half, bringing out a diving save from Mendi. Two minutes later, and there was more diving on display, this time slightly less impressive from Kai Habits. But Chelsea needed this, a League Cup final defeat and Champions League exit, fueling a fight and piling pressure on Palace. 65 minutes in and the pressure paid off. Ruben Loftus cheek shot grounding the Eagles. There's the Chelsea breakthrough. Palace tried to mount a comeback, only for Mount to come back and put the tie out of reach. Brilliantly incisive attacking play. This was exactly the 90 minutes that Chelsea needed as they headed their third successive FA Cup final in a season which has threatened a lack of silverware they now need to overcome Liverpool to secure that much needed trophy which may also help secure a much needed owner that's it for Easter sport. Hope you've had a good weekend. That's been okay, sad. Not from having to put up with me. Yeah, then the brakes. Thank you. Dan's back with who will need the raincoat for the trip back to work.

And it will take you through every emotion. What's going on? New rolling in it next on one. Yeah, that was a real contrast to the weather across much of the country today. For some, it was a cold, frosty start, as long as minus three, minus four to parts of the targo. Compare that to the other side of the country where you picked up. It was a day for the ducks. Almost a month's worth of rain for Funga, four of the likes of, actually, Funga, you had 107 millimeters, 125 would be a typical month. And it's, of course, down to a stuck weather system blocking high, that system there. And if you notice some of those red blobs there it's, of course, down to a stuck weather system blocking high. That system there. And if you notice some of those red blobs there, even some of it thundry there just to the west of parts of Northam. The whole front there, it can't move that way because of the big bubble, the mountain warm air of high pressure. So instead, one piece goes there, the other that goes there. It's still going to be wet across the north of the country. You trek back to work. Notice where the watches and mornings are. Severe thunderstorm watch for parts of Northland to tomorrow morning. A couple of rain watches and mornings as well, really for the upper North Thunder. See how that area blue there just sits there. It'll slowly start to spread south. And as it does, think it like it pulls something apart. See how it becomes a bit more mottled and moth-eaten. It gets down to really parts of the central plateau by the end of the day, confining the rain to much of the Bay of Plenty Coromandel. Rain in the morning for Northland and Auckland, that should ease, maybe Tadalunaka the odd shower, everywhere else you're fine. One front sliding by the far south may just bring spots of rain to Fjordland, perhaps coastal parts of southam, but everyone else you're otherwise fine. So rain is the story. These watches and mornings will disappear. Most of the rain will ease as you get towards the end of the day. Heads up still for that wrist of some thunder. A few heavier bursts, particularly into the first part of the day. For Auckland, keep your raincoat as you start off the day. Most of the first part of the day, particularly Rodney North and east of see that wet weather. Easing away, go into the course of the afternoon, 23, 24, and for Hamilton, too, rain as you start the day. 22 is where you finish. You will keep the spells of rain and perhaps even the odd heavier bursts as well. And you'll see what I mean. Look at the bay of plenty here. This is the rain just sort of more or less coming in. See some of the darker blues there. Those are some heavier bursts. Might see that as perhaps thundery as well. Fakatane, more likely just a morning shower for Tamerunui. You'll see 22 as you finish off. And for Toronga, rain heavy at times. Maybe thundery as well right through the course of the 21 degrees. Here is where we finish. But going further east of the range, it's more likely just some cloud, some drizzle for Gispen, down towards hasting. More likely first part of the day. Head south from that mast and you're still got the sunshine. You're going to be 22 degrees. And track you way further west for the likes of New Plymouth, Major C1 or two showers in the morning. Everyone else you find, Fong and Nui, top temperature for all the day today, 23. You could do the same tomorrow, and a few others could join you in the mix as well, that mild flow, the reason why. For Wellington, you've got 20 degrees. You aren't looking too bad as well. It's a decent looking day. Overall, fine, just to finish up what has been a nice little spell for you. To Nelson will increase the cloud, spots are blue, maybe a spot of rain by the evening. Blenheim is fine, Westport, we're just dragging a bit more cloud. Maybe by the evening you could see a spot or two of rain as that same front drags itself a little bit closer. Morning cloud heads up as a fog as well for Christchurch, first part of the day, 20 degrees and sunshine as skies brighten up into the course of the afternoon. Head south, head west, you're all fine. We'll drag a bit more cloud to the west coast through the afternoon. Greymouth, you'll see that everyone else you're looking fine. Cool start and touch a frost and a few spots to the interior. 18 degrees, maybe some early low cloud and some fog for Queenstown, but you're fine with sunshine into the course of the afternoon. Now, track south, look west. It's all pretty decent, maybe seeing some spots of rain to Milford Sound mostly into the morning. Front just kind of bordles along, so you could pick up a bit of a wet weather from that for, say, Stuart Arden. I think it's just on the edge, Invercargo, okay for you, and pretty decent for Dunedin. Fine-looking day, get up to about 20. Yeah, 20 degrees above where you should be for the time of year. Now, Wednesday, wet weather still sitting there. This becomes the raincoat day. Go into Thursday. We drag something from the southern ocean. That cranks its way in, good old northerly. That'll be some cooler air too. Thursday, if you'll certainly grab the raincoat cooler weather to finish as we get towards the end of the week. So up and down but some further north raincoats, further south. Extra layers. 10 or 5, thanks, Dan. And that is 1 News this Monday or maybe you can keep right up to date with any developments on our stories tonight on our website, 1News.co.mz, from the team for Maraier. Good night."}
