R&Z News at 5, good afternoon, Ahi Ahimari, I'm Evie Ashton. The Prime Minister insists the government is doing all it can to address rising inflation which has hit almost 7%. Opposition parties are calling on labour to rain in spending to ease the pressure. Speaking from Japan, Jacinda Adairn says steps are already being taken. We've already moved obviously to try and tackle and make a difference for New Zealand is at the pump on one of the biggest contributors to inflation which has been those increases in fuel prices. So that decision, we hope, eases some of that pressure. Justinder Adairn says inflation is a global issue with many of New Zealand's trade partners, also feeling the pinch. The president of the World Bank says the world is facing a human catastrophea human catastrophey. global issue with many of New Zealand's trade partners also feeling the pinch. The President of the World Bank says the world is facing a human catastrophe from the food crisis that's followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. David Malpas is warning record rises and food prices are pushing hundreds of millions towards poverty and lower nutrition. The BBC's FISA reports. The World Bank calculates that the war in Ukraine is helping lead to a huge 37% increase in food prices year on year, which is magnified for the poor who will eat less and have less money for anything else such as schooling, according to its president David Malpass. The price rises are broad-based affecting oils grains and wheat. But there is enough food-based, defecting oils, grains and wheat, but there is enough food in the world to feed everybody, he said, with global stockpiles high. But nations are starting to subsidise prices rather than increased supplies which could worse in the situation. Ukrainian officials have offered to negotiate without any conditions for the evacuation of civilians and military personnel from Marjupol amid growing fears the city will fall to the Russians. A Ukrainian commander has made a desperate plea for help, while Cheshny's leader, Rum growing influence in the Indo-Pacific will be high on the agenda as the Prime Minister meets with her Japanese counterpart for the first time today. While trade agreements and tariffs are the focus of her Tokyo trip, Jacinda Arden says Japan and New Zealand are both concerned about any escalating tensions in the Pacific. She says China has been increasingly assertive and countries will need to work closer with them. The meeting gets underway in a few hours. The health minister says the new health systems bottom-up approach, sorry, bottom-up approach, puts communities at its centre. Andrew Little was in Hodfenua today to announce the region as one of nine locality networks that will be in place when the health reforms take effect in July. He says these networks will identify what's actually needed in communities, putting local voices front and centre. This is actually about a process that actively brings not just health providers but other those are organizations also connected with people as well be. and like if you look at the Ota Papatoa-tore one there's sports clubs involved in that so anything anybody actively involved in in the community's well-being can participate and then talk about what is needed. National Health Spokesperson Dr Shane O'retti says new details show the health reforms are just more bureaucracy. A man has been arrested after a patrol car was rammed and another car smashed into during wild scenes on the roads in central Timaroo this morning. The police say the 34-year-old driver of a black Holden Commodore is facing multiple serious charges. Timothy Brown has more. Officers received multiple reports of the Holden being driven dangerously through Timaru this morning. A patrol car looking for it was rammed in the suburb of Parkside. The police car was damaged but no one was injured. The driver fled at high speed. A short time later, about quarter to 12, the vehicle went through the intersection of Arthur Street and State Highway 1 and hit another car. The second car's occupants were taken to hospital but aren't badly injured. The Holden's driver was promptly arrested. To sport and new Blackferns coach Wayne Smith says he never thought he'd be leading a team to a World Cup at the age of 65. The former All Black's coach replaces Glenn Moore who resigned following a scathing review into the Blackferns environment. The report was also highly critical of New Zealand rugby and its resourcing of the side. Smith now has five months to prepare the team for the World Cup defence. I applied for the pension two days ago. This was almost a labour of love at the start to office and mates and a bit of a bit of a hand. It's become bigger than that clearly because of what's occurred over the last couple of weeks. But I'm up for it. Former tennis champion Martina Navratilova is criticising Wimbledon for banning players from Russia and Belarus because of the invasion of Ukraine. The decision means men world number two, Daniel Medvedved means men, world number two, Daniel Medvedev and women's number four, Arina Sabalenka, won't be there. Former Ukrainian players are welcoming the move, but the international men's bodies, the ATP and the WTO, oppose it. Navratilova believes the ban is a step too far. Exclusion is not like this, is through no fault of these players, is not the way to go. And as much as I feel for the Ukrainian players and Ukrainian people, of course, it's just horrific, what's going on, but I think this is just going further than needed to be. And Manchester City has leapfrogged Liverpool to return to the Premier League with a three-nil win over Brighton. That's the news. A strong reaction to the suggestion to scrap Labour Day. Going after Labor Day, perhaps because of what it symbolises, just feels messy and neat services. Netflix feels the chill. It's a very fine line between nudging people to pay for something when they kind of know that they should pay and being aggravating. And we're always keen on your views. Don't get in text it into saying, Mr Aron, I was organic porridge, but Mike has texted so just had sausage-eat tomato with fried bread on the barbecue power still off at Lake A's. A small rest board of choices, or a morning report goes from 6 on Aranziv National. You're on checkpoint with Lisa Ohon next, first the short forecast from Met Service to midnight Friday. From Northland to Waiteaumo, including Coromandel Bay of Plenty, Tomod, T'oente, Tomodh, T'o M'enti, T'o-Maroui and Thau M'u-Nu'aupau, S'a and Hawkes Bay, I have fine weather today, rain for a time tomorrow.

Otago in Southland, periods of rain, with heavy falls possible, easing to a few showers tomorrow morning. And for Dekoho, the Chatham Islands, cloudy periods, heavy rain is developing tomorrow evening.. It's seven minutes past five five, but we'll have news headlines for you at 5. in 2022. Figures out today confirm what you probably already been feeling. The consumer price index increased 6.9% in the year ending March 31st, a three-decade high. Food prices are among the main drivers with a 9.3% jump on fruit and vegetables. Housing is to blame two with inflation from home ownership up 18% for the year, but the government's sticking to its line, international factors are largely to blame. Our reporter Jake McKee and cameraman Angustry they have the story. A tight pinch in the pocket but also a strain on resources. The consumer's price index has hit the highest level in more than 30 years. 6.9% in the year to March 2022. Everything is getting more expensive. Now it's record breaking. Stats and Z says the main driver behind inflation is rising prices for construction and housing rentals fed by things like supply chain issues and demand. Our rent has just gone up, I think, $40, which is pretty heavy increase if you're sort of like already sort of scraping to get all your food and get everything going really yeah getting from A to B is also costing more I filled up my car from nearly empty the other day and it was the largest amount of money I'd ever put in over $150. When you're putting the most money into a car you've ever done, like, is it a shock to see that? Of course it is. You know, it just kept going and going and going and glugging and glugging and glugging and then you turn around and it's $150-something. It's insane. It doesn't end there. we spoke to and making more conscious decisions at the supermarket. Me, mainly we fortunately are retired so we don't have to worry about children but those with children I feel really sorry for. Obviously it's quite hard to kind of eat healthy if prices are healthy if we'd go up. The rising cost of living is seeing a new group of people heading through the doors of social services. It's not just those most in need looking for help, that needs even creeping into the lives of some middle-income earners. Newtown Budgeting and advocacy services manager Gary Sutton says people are paying so much to keep a roof over their heads. They're left with limited funds for other bills. Most of them are struggling with just getting food on the table, particularly families. We're getting an increasing number of families coming and telling us that they were able to make it before. Recently, they can't, and they need help with their budgeting, with loan repayments and things like this. He has a message for anyone finding it tough. These things can be managed in a way that you can make it and take care of your family, take care of your mortgage and all these different things. Please access the service that can help you. Wellington City Commissioner Mary Edredge says for those facing the worst of it, life is becoming almost impossible. Most of us moan about the prices. Most of us don't like the price of petrol or are concerned about the grocery shop. For people who are doing life hard, this is not just an inconvenience or a frustration, this is catastrophic. Murray Edrich says there are cumulative factors that have gone unchanged for years like increasing rental costs in substandard housing which can impact someone's health, another bill added to the pile. I worry that we've got a community of people who are really really struggling. Firstly that we don't see them because they're invisible in our community. And secondly we've perhaps judged them for their circumstance and actually what we know is that the cost of living at the moment, the inflation, the cost of housing, means that life is really tough for people. In Parliament, opposition parties are calling for the government to take some responsibility and come up with a plan. Finance Minister Grant Robertson sees the government has taken steps to ease the pressure in people's pockets. So there are short-term and long-term things we can do to help New Zealand is through this, but fundamentally this remains an inflation situation that's driven by global factors. The inflation boom is something the reserve bank is trying to control through higher interest rates. And if you are listening to that on radio, the video for Jake and Angusis story will be up on our web page. So what does it all mean for your back pocket? Well joining us now is Andrew Henderson from the Dunedin Budget Advisory Advisory Service. Kira Andrew. Andrew Henderson from the Dunedin Budget Advisory Service. Kewa, Andrew? Good afternoon Lisa. These are really big numbers in terms of inflation. I'm wondering in your line of work, who is it hitting the hardest at the moment? So we're seeing a increase in clients from the middle income bracket, but predominantly inflation seems to be really hitting low-income Kiwis. So when you say middle income what kind of earnings are we talking about? So I would say in the 50 to 70K bracket so people that have managed okay in the past but probably they're over lever- over leveraged with debt now and with everything that's going on which is quite hard for us to separate so things like COVID the ballooning housing costs in today's announcement about inflation those type of families are really starting to struggle as well. Where are the pinch points? What are the things that they are really struggling with? Is it food, rent, power? All of the above, Lisa, it's, yeah, everything. So, as we know, housing costs have ballooned. Food has become more expensive than inflation that was announced today. So we were disappointed to see that the cost of food went up by 7.6% so that was from Stets New Zealand last week that came out and there is even higher than inflation is at the moment. Yeah what is well what do you consider reasonable a reasonable spend for food because I know the Otago food cost survey was being used by work and income for example so what's a reasonable budget and and what has it been and what is and what is it now given inflation? So we used to use and I I know this sounds horrible, but we used to use a figure of approximately $65 a week for someone on a low income, eating a basic healthy diet. Now I would say that that is up around $75, which if you think about it, it Lisa it's not a lot of money to go towards food for someone for a week and then that so that would be for an adult male for an adolescent with looking somewhere near $80 a week. 65 back sounds like a pretty miserable existence Andrew. That's horrible it's so that means what they try to base the survey on is eating a balanced diet so they're talking about eating meat, fresh frozen vegetables when they're in season but honestly that is just not enough so we predominantly are seeing more and more people having to live on unhealthy options like white bread, pies, noodles, five dollar pizzas, fish and chips. So yeah, those sort of things. So doing it tough? Yes, it's horrible and it's not good for people and it's definitely not good for children. Thank you for joining us Andrew, really appreciate your time. That is Andrew Henderson, who's with the Dunedin Budget Advisory Service. Hormai Orfakaro, we would love your feedback. Norda Anaa Nakopamote Horte Horta Hortakanei,, some big numbers there in terms of inflation, 30 year high, 6.9% where are you feeling it? How are you cutting costs? Text me. Partuime, 2.101.

Price was shot dead on the road between New Plymouth and Waiter on Saturday night. Our reporter Nick Truebridge joins me now live in the studio. Nick what are the police saying? Yeah let's start with the top line of this lease, right down the bottom of the police police press release here. The fact that Mr Price did not have a firearm when he was shot. Of course, police commence first date immediately after this incident he died at the scene. They then searched over him obviously, no firearm present, no firearm recovered. And what are they wanting from in terms of assistance from people here? Yeah, so they've put a bit of a plea out here asking for anyone who might have any information in terms of footage or anything like that of the scene. They have bought in an investigation team it says here interestingly from outside Taranaki anyone with information is asked to email Operation Woods at police dot govet.azg.az. Yeah that is interesting because there were some concerns raised about about the officers in charge do not come from the Taranaki district. That's right that's confirmed here. Okay and what more detail are we able to glean from this about what actually unfolded on the night? Yeah so R&T listeners this morning would have heard Mardi party co-leader actually on our airwaves talking about I guess just the lack of information that's come out over this so far and and police have now provided a bit a bit. Basically what's happened, this all went down about 930 on Saturday night, is police have been attending to a car in front of Mr Price's car. He's then overtaken that car, sped down the road with no lights on. He's turned around doubled back at some stage and police and police are contending in their press release here that he has driven back towards a police car at speed. He's missed that car, but police then say he aimed his vehicle at another car, another police car, and hit that car. At which point his vehicle has been immobilised, he's then obviously jumped out of that vehicle and police are saying here that he has tried to commandeer a number of vehicles from members of the public who had been stopped due to the incident. At that stage, police say here verbatim he was shot while attempting to take control of one of these vehicles. So a little bit more information here, as I say, just for people who are clocking and now, back to that top line, police confirming he wasn't harmed once they searched his body of course. Okay and as you say this is the police version of events and they are calling for additional witnesses and people who may have video. Interestingly there seems to be a large number of vehicles involved in this in terms of their examination? Yeah that's right. quite a large section of road that was investigated as a result of this. So they're saying two hundred and thirty along state highway highway three have been sort of combed over I suppose you could say. Exhibits requiring forensic examination, fifteen vehicles, I mean I suppose that shows you how big this scene was, how much traffic was backed up as a result of this commotion, 15 vehicles and one trailer as well. Thanks for that, Nick, thanks for the. That is, as Nick says, the police are seeking information. This is in respect of the fatal shooting of chaos price by police. If you have any footage or any information that may assist, Operation Woods at police.gov, govet.N.Z, is the email address where you can send that through. Dancing kiwifro, calligraphy and clean green cars, the Prime Minister has had an electric first day in Tokyo as she embarks on the second leg of her international trade mission. Just Sandra Derm will sit down with her Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida later this evening, how Deputy Political Editor Craig McCulloch is there. Just under our doin' at a zesbri event in Tokyo, flanked by its mascots, the so-called Kiwi Brothers, dancing fruit with bugged-out eyes and large fruity males. So I hope that this season, as consumers in Japan, pick up one of their most favourite nutritious vitamin C-packed fruits, one that I can be a testament, makes it easier to get a healthy and nutritious meal into a toddler, they can also start to plan a trip to visit and see where they are grown. Japan is a major export market for New Zealand kiwi fruit, worth $600 million last year. The trade minister, Damien O'Connor, tried his hand at Pavlova decoration. The PM at Kigraphy. Slightly unfair that I've had one run at the board, so or thoroughly if I'm going to have a second because I'm concerned that perhaps this doesn't say here we fruit. And we'll never be royal. It's a one and our love. From there it was on to the iconic Tokyo Tower, when New Zealand music pumped through the sound system. Toyota New Zealand announced the debut of teen hydrogen-powered vehicles in Auckland as part of a business car sharing scheme. In turn, the government is helping fund a series of refueling stations across the North Island. New Zealand has a target of more than one million zero-emission vehicles by 2035. We strongly encourage Japanese companies to partner with us and play a leading role to help us achieve this target. Damien O'Connor even allowed behind the wheel. Perhaps as a petrol head myself, I've come to the reality that this is the technology that we will be using into the future and we should grasp both hands. Today the clear focus has been business as exporters cash in on the Prime Minister's presence for a profile boost. GNS science even turned up to celebrate the setting up of an office in Tokyo. Tonight the PM's focus will shift back to the geopolitical. Mazadun will sit down with her Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida, their first conversation since his election last year. And there's plenty to talk about, as China flexes in the Pacific, and Russia continues to wage war on Ukraine. We are in many ways have common values with Japan. I know that they are as disturbed as we are about what is happening in Ukraine. You've seen a very strong response from Japan to that action. So no doubt we'll discuss that, what it means for the world, what it means for our region. The reality of Prime Ministerial travel abroad, a day can begin with dancing kiw fruit, and finish with discussion of war. It is 23 minutes past 5, Kiamatoremai. Stay with us, you're listening to checkpoint on RNZ National. It's big, it's blue and it's hoping to pave the way forward for how we deal with our e-waste. The blue box machine is aiming to catapult New Zealand from one of the worst electronic waste offenders to one of the best. The recycling machine is one of eight in the world and was switched on for the first time at computer recycling in Penrose this afternoon. Our reporter Louise Tanouth is there and joins us now. Louise, what's this all about? Kewa Lisa, I'm here at computer recycling here in Penrose and it's all kicked off here today so for those that are listening and not watching the blue box sounds and looks exactly like it says it's a big blue box about 30 meters long and it looks a little bit like a Willie Wonga machine but it does a lot more than that. It's tackling our e-waste problem. Now here in New Zealand we're some of the worst offenders when it comes to e-waste. The average keywoe produces around 20 k-gis of e-of e-ewaastses of e-waste per year and only around 2% of our e-waste is able to be recycled. But this is going to change all of that. Now I'm here with the general manager of computer recycling Patrick. Now Patrick tell me just how bad is our e-waste problem and what is the blue box going to do to change that? By Louise, so yeah, thanks very much for having me on. So the problem in New Zealand is that the large majority of electronic waste is a whole variety of reasons why this happens, but we have very low recycling and recovery rates here. So what computer recycling is done with support from the Ministry for the Environment, the waste minimisation fund is we've set up a, I believe it was about 3.5 million dollar project to bring in the Blue Box and MSS, E-Max optical sorta, whereby we can shreds and separate the materials that comes from electronic waste and then grade and sort it into commodities. And so for our radio listeners that can't see just how big this machine is behind us, talk us through, say you've got a TV, say you've got a laptop, you want to chuck it through, what does it start out like and then what happens, what is the process and what do we end up with? Well, as you described, the items will come to us here at Computer Recycling and be it a whole TV, let's say a 65-inch TV, which is commonplace these days. So it'll start as a whole unit, a whole unit, a whole unit, a whole unit, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a whole TV, let's say a 65 inch TV which is commonplace these days. So it'll start as a whole unit and then it'll get fed into the mouth of the blue box or the hopper essentially. Through there it has quite a powerful shredder. The shredder then goes through a series of separation processes which then takes out the steel and then we're left with the fines and the different sized fragments. So those fragments, as you can kind of see in this bowl, it's quite nifty, are made up by a whole heap of different commodities so that's then loaded into this MSS optical sorta and through a vibrator table it's spread across a high-speed conveyor and then it uses cameras and lasers essentially to scan the product and using pneumatic air it will blow it into its desired commodity types. So when it's ended up like that, where does that then go and what is that then repurpose for? So once it's graded into its commodity, we've taken computer recycling quite a few years but established downstream relationships with what they're called refineries overseas. So the graded material will in many cases go to Belgium or to South Korea, where it's refined back into the base material. Additionally, we've partnered with a New Zealand company called Global Metal Solutions that are able to, on a very large scale, commoditise the scrap or non-ferrous and steel elements, and they ship it on our behalf. Fantastic. So Lisa there you have it if you've got an old laptop if you've got anything lying around the house bring it here to computer recycling and it's going to be repurposed rather than ending up in that skip then. Hey Louise before Patrick takes off could you just quickly ask him how much can that one machine munch up? Patrick they want to know much can that one machine munch up? Patrick, they want to know how much can this machine munch up? So the capacity on this machine for general television set, is to take TVs, which makes up roughly, I believe, 16% of the whole stream. We can do about a thousand kilos an hour through the blue box and then 1,500 kilos per hour through the optical sorta. So on a single shift, do about a thousand kilos an hour through the blue box and then 1,500 kilos per hour through the optical sorter. So on a single shift, do between 8 or 9,000 kilos, 8 or 9 ton, and obviously on a double shift that's 16, and it's about 2,000 tons or 2 million kilos per year. Some pretty hefty numbers there Lisa. Yeah, a lot of TV's Louise Louise Louise Louise Louise, Taneuthier, Recy of TV's Louise. Thank you for that. That is Louise Taneuthier on the Big Blue Box, recycling e-waste. Former All- blacks coach Wayne Smith has been named as the new coach of the Blackferns replacing Glenn Moore who resigned at the weekend. More through in the towel following a scathing review into the Blackferns Environment which was also highly critical of New Zealand rugby and its resourcing of the side. The Blackferns who will attempt to defend their World Cup title on home soil later this year suffered four heavy defeats at the hands of England and France last November. Wayne Smith says the team has some catching up to do. Talking about playing against teams, particularly a couple of teams, England and France, who have been professional for quite a while. And in terms of physical development you know that that's important so you've got girls that have been training as professionals for three years for example so there's a bit of catching up to do there and joining us now is rugby reporter Joe Porter hey Joe there's well is a short runway to the World Cup defense in October in November why is Wayne Smith decided to do this? Yeah you're right a very short runway not much time but all to turn the team around and give him back to World Beaters. Well he initially joined the Blackferns as a technical advisor a few weeks ago and that move was inspired by or he's come out of the time of the first of course that move was inspired by his his friend Laurie O'nReilly who died in 1998. He was the first coach of the Blackferns in a women's rugby trailblazer and sort of Wayne Smith had made a commitment to him that he would try and do his best whatever he could to promote the women's game and move it forward so I guess he's taken that one step further now by becoming the head coach of the Blackferns team who like if they have just until October until October to October to be in October to be in, this World Cup title they won back in 2017. So the elephant in the room, Glenn Moore, did he have anything to say about the departing coach? Well he was actually fairly violent of them or to be perfectly fair. He said he was Glenn Moore's been more than happy to help throughout the duration of this process. Even whilst the review was being made public and his position was looking less and less tenable. He said he's always been available to help Wayne when he's needed help. He feels for him as a green, he's rungum and said how much that happens to all the other coaching group, members of the coaching group, including Whitney Hampton, Sir Steve Hanson, and his daughter, like Glenmore and they wish him the best of of life for the future for of like for the future. So purely full of praise really for Glenmore and not willing to say that he left the culture in a bad shape and in fact saying that there are hallmarks of a good culture within this black firms team. Thanks for the update Joe that is rugby reporter Joe Porter there Wayne Smith confirmed as the new coach of the Blackf skate moves. Hormai or Fakaro, we would love your feedback on anything if you're going tonight. You can text us to 101, tweet us at checkpoint rnZ, the email address is checkpoints at rnZ.co.nz.nz. Time to get to the headlines now, called Evie Arnotenay. The Taranaki man who was fatally shot by police taxes to ease on Saturday night was not armed. Chaos Price rammed a police car on State Highway 3 between New Plymouth and Waitera. He was shot while trying to take a vehicle from a person who'd stopped. Mr Price's body was returned to his family yesterday. The Prime Minister says the government has already cut fuel taxes to ease the pressure on inflation. The latest figures show annual inflation is running at 6.9% although it's lower than expectations, it's the highest rate in around three decades. Just under Arduin says New Zealand is far from alone in experiencing rapidly rising inflation and many of our trade partners have the same problem. The Health Minister says the new health reforms will identify what is actually needed in communities. Andrew Little was in the Hordafenua today to announce that the region would be one of nine networks when the health reforms take effect in July. He says the new system will put local voices front and centre. National's health spokesperson, Dr Shane Ritti, says the reforms are just more bureaucracy. A Ukrainian commander is making a desperate plea for help to evacuate people from Marjupol, fearing Moscow could seize the city as soon as tonight. The president of the World Bank says the world is facing a human catastrophe from the food crisis that has allowed that has followed Russia's invasion. There are 10,294-294 new community cases of COVID-19, around a thousand fewer than yesterday. The number of active community cases is now 55,500. Another 18 people have died. And traffic diversions are in place on State Highway 7 near Hanmer Springs in Canterbury and on State Highway 1 at Levin after serious crashes. Those are the headlines. Our next news and weather is at 6. Kiyorara Yvonne O'Malleyimai. This is checkpoint called Lisa Owintene. It is time for the business news called Takuho Inai Nainai, called Nicholas Pointin, who joins us live. Nicholas, let's start with Toyo to New Zealand. It's partnered with some big name corporates to trial hydrogen-powered vehicles. What's going on? Yeah, so they're joining forces with the likes of Air, New Zealand, Westpac, Bank, Spark. I won't name them all, but you sort of get the sense that these are some high-profile companies based here in Auckland and what they're looking to do is to trial the Toyota to Mariatim.. It's a car that's hydrogen power, not currently available in New Zealand, but they're going to trial this car through a car sharing scheme within the Auckland Central. So people probably be aware of car sharing schemes like Mivo, where you pay subscription, you can use the cars that are parked in and around the city. That's essentially what's going to take place here within the CED, two cars will be on trial over a period of three months? Toyota may look to add other vehicles, but look, that just depends on what level of interest there is. But guess what Toyota is trying to find out from this is, you know, what is the demand for these sorts of vehicles? What is the feedback from the corporates that are using them? is a corporate cash sharing scheme, an actual feasible alternative to maybe companies having numerous company vehicles. Because part of what they're trying to look at here is, can we actually decarbonise transport within Auckland, within Central Auckland, within Central Auckland, but it also has ulterior motives, hydrogen power, it's something that Toyota's invested a lot of money in, and the technology involved in this vehicle, they want to see if it has other applications. So their car, C&I, to see whether or not the technology can be used in buses, can it be used for energy generation. But like I should mention that, and Toyota does acknowledge this, that hydrogen energy infrastructure in New Zealand is very much in its infancy. You know, last year a company called Herringa Energy based out in Taranaki, they spend you about $50 million to build four hydrogen refueling stations across the North Island. They're also importing 20 hydrogen-powered trucks. Now they expect them to be operational by the end of 2022, but even they acknowledge we're still some years away before hydrogen-powered trucks can compete with their diesel counterparts in terms of price and also in terms of those operating costs. So look, hydrogen power, it's an exciting notion towards decarbonizing our transport fleet, but don't expect to see many of these vehicles on our roads any time soon. Okay then, Nicholas, let's change from hydrogen to solar. Contact Energy is the latest energy as the latest power company to announce a renewable energy project. What are they up to? Yeah, look, they're teaming up with an international solar developer, that is, to build a series of large solar farms essentially across the North Island, maybe looking at the South Island as well. They've teamed up with light source. They're hoping to build a farm big enough to support about 50,000 homes. They're looking to sort of break ground on that project within the next 48 months. Hopefully have an operational by 2026. But this comes, this follows sort of a flurry of activity in this space. Early this week we're talking about heliosenaging. They want to spend up to a billion dollars to build a large solar farm that's capable of supporting 250,000 homes. Last year, Genesis pulled the trigger on a similar project teaming up with an Australian developer and it just seems that at the moment that solar energy projects, the economics of them are improving. The cost of actually building them are coming down. And one of the encouraging things for these projects and why they're attracting such a high degree of attention is how quickly they can be built before and get them operational. But look with a lot of these projects while announcements have been made they're still very much in their in their primary phases. Look I spoke to contact this afternoon they haven't actually bought any land and a key thing for them is actually buying land in places where it's you know it's cheap to buy, it gets plenty of sunlight and it's also close to transmission points so they can feed their electricity easily into the grid. And Nicholas on your mind gets get set markets. Yeah, NZX is down 12 points to 11,954, the dollar trading at 67.67.67. trading at 67.9 US cents took a bit of a hit on the back of those CPI figures but it's recovered since then and it's trading at 91.3 Australian. Kakita Nicholas, Nicholas, pointed in there with business news. And it's official, New Zealand has an inflation situation, it's going up and up, cracking a 30-year high at 6.9 percent. In plain English English a bunch of the basics are getting more and more expensive here some headline numbers for the past year cost for new house up 18% petrol up more than 32% fruit and vegge a more than 9% increase economist Cameron Bagri has been chewing over the numbers and joins us now cured it Cameron 6.9% good battle, plain ugly. How would you characterize it? Well it's not as bad as some feed but the people I've twice and I said it's a pretty ugly number. I guess the way to sort of resonate with people is that we got inflation, it's up around seven. Yeah wage inflation, that's your pay packets, it's just going up by about 3%. We're going to get some numbers to confirm that in a couple of weeks. Well, three, minus seven, there's negative four. Now, negative four is moving backwards to put the negative four in perspective. That is how much people spend of the CPI basket on clothing and shoes. So when you go back to the tune of four percentage points, you can't afford the shoes or the clothes. And what about the people, Cameron, who couldn't afford the shoes and the clothes in the first place? Well, yeah, that's a separate issue compared to what's going on with today's CPI figures. You see that today's CPI figures, is this really all about the emergence of an inflation piece? And placing takes money out of people's pockets. So what you're seeing at the moment is a story of more people are going backwards. Yeah so in saying that in that example you use of food, sorry of clothing and shoes is really helpful, but for an average household could you put a dollar figure on how much extra they would be paying in a year with inflation around 7% just to keep chugging along doing the same things that they have been with food and housing? Well, you said everything depends on everybody's individual budget, how much they earn and that sort of stuff. But let's say, just for argument's sake, your household income was $2,000 and for every dollar that you spent, $8, now that's a $2,000 came in and $2,000 went out. So if you go on back with the tune of 4% of $4,000, $2,000 is $80 you'll worst, often compared to where you were 12 months ago. The finance minister keeps telling us that this is a global issue, right? Supply chain, COVID Ukraine. How much of this inflation is imported and how much is kind of entrenched in the local economy? Right, so if we have a look at the broad headline inflation of 6.9%, what's called tradable inflation, which is the imported component, yeah that's a lot of stuff that's beyond our control, COVID logistics, that's petrol prices, driven by international water prices, these sort of things, that's a pretty eye-watering eight and a half percent. Now if we look at domestic inflation, which is another 50% of the inflation basket, then it's running at six percent. So it's not as bad as tradable inflation, but non-tratable inflation up around 6% is in still an incredibly high number, and that's the degree of inflation that reflects in all honesty an economy that's actually done too well and exceeded expectations. Ironically, success may as a result of a pop variable in the form of inflation reminding us that we're actually living beyond that means we're actually doing too well and this is why the reserve ends waiving that interest rates stick lifting interest rates up because when you got domestic inflation running up around 6% you're a long way away from where you need to be they need to literally bludging the economy into a slower growth trajectory to get that domestic inflation pulse back under control because back under control because a lot of the inflation that we are seeing to be fair and the tradable stuff they can't really control but the 50% of it in regard to non-tradable that is in the eyesight of the reserving as we speak. Yeah and you've taken us to exactly where I want to be mortgage costs right so official cash raid is at 1.5% what can people expect is going to happen on the back of these figures? Well it's not just expecting what has happened, it's what's already happened. Yeah so what we're seeing is that the reality we knew inflation was going to be moving up and it's been moving up a little bit more aggressive but the reserve bank started to raise interest rates in the 2022. Yeah we've already seen a one-year fixed mortgage rate that's gone from in the low two, you now talk on the high threes or the low fours. So for a lot of people out there at the moment, there's about $170 billion worth of mortgage debt, it's rolling off of the new to 12 months, so odds are the mortgage costs are going to be broadly doubling. The notable mortgage cost, at say four and a half a cent still looks low historical, but if you've taken your first mortgage at 2.19 percent, which is some of the rates for an offer in early 2021, be even for one hell of a shock in 2022. Once again, ironically, you have success in the form of a really strong economy, hot property market, low unemployment rate, we're now getting the reminder that too much success comes with fundamental problems down the crack in regard to too much inflation and the reserve banks coming out trying to change a trajectory for the New Zealand economy. Thanks for your analysis there Cameron, that's Cameron Bagry economist there who's been looking at those inflation numbers. It is 18 minutes to 6. Ukraine's Ukrainian city of Murray-apol still under heavy bombardment is on the brink of falling to Russia. Ukraine's President Zelenski is offering to exchange Russian prisoners of war for a guarantee of safe passage for thousands still trapped there. A Ukrainian commander based at the steelworks where some of the final few troops and civilians are based says there's very little time left before their overrun. The BBC's Mark Lowen reports. In the fog of war, Russia's ferocious fire power is unrelenting. Marupol once a thriving port city besieged and broken. The last bastion of Ukraine's resistance is the Azov-style steel plant, perhaps a few thousand soldiers and civilians in its bunkers and tunnels, a patch of land holding out against one of the world's biggest armies. And now a rare voice from to the world. This is our appeal to the world. It could be the last of our lives. We are probably facing our final days, if not ours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. But again today, they refused Russia's latest surrender deadline. And again, an attempt at a humanitarian corridor failed. Ukraine's president said he's offered Moscow an exchange of Russian prisoners of war for safe passage out of Marjupo. We are ready for different formats of exchanging our people for the Russian people, the Russian military they left behind. They both left corpses scattered and abandoned wounded people. Across the country in Kiev it's all quiet on the Western front. So from a volunteer center they send supplies to the east, first aid, food and preparations for battle to those repelling the Russian assault. Among the staff is Olena Nikolina whose cousin Max is one of the last fighters in the steel plant. The pride of Russian army here. They've gathered spoils of war from an invasion that's not gone Moscow's way. This badge says that death is better than dishonor. Olliana hopes her cousin will return with more fragments of Russian losses. Do you feel proud of him? Yeah, totally. I would have never imagined my cousin to become a true hero of Ukraine and hero of Maribel. There's obviously a very bitter sense of proud, in a sense that he is in life-threatening situation, but I am very proud of him. The associations representing international tennis players have criticised Wimbledon's banning of players from Russia and Belarus. The Grand Slam tournament has made the call because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine but the associations say the exclusion of players based on their nationality is a violation of their agreement with Wimbledon. Sports editor Stephen Houston reports. the of the highest ranked players to be affected by Wimbledon's ban. But the governing bodies of men's and women's professional tennis say the moves unfair. The men's body, the ATP, says it could a damaging precedent for the game. While the women's body, the WTO, says it's very disappointed. However, Ukrainian former player Sergei Sikovsky's's backed Wimbledon's move. I do have a symptom and I know that there will be some who were against it, they were vocal about it, but every individual in Russia has to feel the consequences of their government. If you don't like, if you want to compete, well I'm pretty sure there's many countries who would welcome you as the citizen. The ATP wants Russian and Belarusian players to be allowed to compete to this events under a neutral flag. Meanwhile the Kremlin says the band's unacceptable and hurt the tournament. Former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova agrees. I wish they had actually talked to me. Maybe I would provide a slightly different perspective and maybe I wouldn't have changed anybody's mind but I feel a lot of these decisions are made in a vacuum where they don't take input from the people that are affected by this. Exclusion is not like this, is through no fault of these players, is not the way to go. And as much as I feel for the Ukrainian players and Ukrainian people, of course, it's just horrificic what's going on, but I think this is just going further than needed to be. The retired Ukrainian player Alexander Dolkopolov has been outspoken about the invasion and has previously urged Russian players to speak out against Russia's actions. Dolkopolov got as high as 13 in the tennis world rankings. Last year he retired and has now returned to Ukraine and enlisted in the army. There's another sign for Russia that they are wrong. world rankings. Last year he retired and has now returned to Ukraine and enlisted in the army. There's another sign for Russia that they are wrong. They have to stop and we're thankful for this. We're thankful for all the health or the weapons we get to survive and keep fighting. Athletics badminton canoeing and rying have all banned individual athletes representing Russia and Belarus. The Russian men's football side was excluded from last month's World Cup qualifiers, forcing them to miss the chance to reach this year's tournament finals in Qatar. But in tennis the question now is where the other tournaments will follow the all- England clubs lead. The French Open entry lists have been published with the likes of Denelme Medfordev and Arena Sabalinka all down to play next month. It'll be the first grand slam of the year. Wimbledon gets underway in late June. For sale, Rumpty, run down 1970s, Dermel fun park about 45 minutes north of Auckland. Fond memories thrown in for free. the black hole twister and speed slides. The owners of why we are hot pools are looking for a buyer or a backer to partner with them to convert the 4.5 hectare beachside site into a wellness centre hotel, residential complex or a combination of all of those. In real estate speak there's endless potential. It's been out of operation since 2018 and has had a checkered history with a previous lease holder including a failed revamp. Collier's agent Josh Coburn says it's now up for grabs on the global market. We have a genuinely once in a generational sort of an opportunity here at Wha where bringing a site of scale that is coastal with exceptionally unique thermal qualities to the market. So are you looking for a buyer or an investor or how would you characterize it? Yeah it's a good question. What we are running is a international expression of interest campaign and so we are seeking all forms of interest whether that be for joint venture business development, free hold sale or even leasehold tenure, all parts, all interest will be considered and the site would lend itself to either a single development vision or as many as probably three divisions of the site based on where the part or slide so we may have one partner we're working with or it may be three. Okay so if we wanted to pass the hat around here we just want to get an idea of how deep our pockets need to be. What are we talking? That's too difficult a question for us to answer. Oh come on Josh, you're a real estate agent with years and years and years of experience. Give us a ballpark mate. Not able to comment on that at the moment, we really need to see. Tens of millions? In the development space, certainly over 10 million. I can't comment beyond that Lisa. But the person, the person company investor buyer, call them what you will, is going to need millions and millions of dollars to be in the hunt here. Well, partial investment will certainly be millions and millions of dollars for sure. You know, at four and a half years, you're talking about substantial, you're talking a substantial development that when it reaches its fullness or full potential will be a significant development in Auckland. And so, yes, correct. So Josh, what is its full potential? Are you talking about a posh spa here? Well, it's got quite a unique zoning on us. There's actually a sub-precing zoning on why we're up, but essentially we have a very flexible zoning. It allows for a very flexible zoning. It allows for residential development that allows for hotels for tourism. It allows for a continuation of a spa-based outcome. And so what we know is going to a world-class location here and we'd like to see a world-class outcome. And so certainly we believe that the thermal water is in those really unique properties or to be integrated into any form of development but you know it's far too early for us to tell who who was interested whether that be you know hotel operators might be retirement tourism operators residential developers or hopefully what we'll see is a combination of all of those sorts of uses. Josh, have you been down the slide there before? I certainly have. I think most Auckland is or most people who have grown up in Auckland will have very fond and nostalgic memories of this place. I certainly spend a good portion of my childhood on those sites and so I'm with the rest of the public who would like to see some aspect of the thermal waters reinstated or redeveloped on the site for sure. She's looking about tired though isn't it right now? Yes it's been a protracted, you know, legal pace that has seen the land returned to its present owners. It's been a well-documented, you know, series of issues that have led to it being in its paper. But the good news is the land is finally back in the hands of vendors who are committed to an outcome and want to see it fully realised. So... I mean there's no yes there's no denying Josh that it is in a sweet spot the coast is just there it is a beautiful setting and as you say the thermal is there but wandering around the park as it is now what does it look like Josh? Oh look it's in a pretty terrible state at the moment and we're in null illusions that the maximised outcome on that site is not likely to see a light renovation of what was there but a substantial redevelopment to recognise that the potential that it has. Yeah. A lot of people's childhood memories riding on this. No pressure. So, tell me about it.., you know, so we's childhood memories riding on this. Yeah. Yeah. To tell me about it, it's, you know, so we're really excited to see this. I'm really excited to see what the outcome is and who comes forward because of that exact reason. Why we're synonymous with the name with warm water and good times and a beautiful, quiet coastal bay and and we hope that developers recognize the rarity of those things in combination. That is real estate agent Josh Coburn send us your thoughts what should they do with why they're at where that location there text is 2-1-1 Twitter at checkpoint rz I'm sure you got some fond childhood memories too. You wouldn't expect a small town and wind it up it to be home to some of New Zealand's naliest skating moments, but Masterton has everything from rollerblading to skateboarding on lock. Yeah, on lock. I had to look that up in the urban dictionary. It actually means readily available. Our reporter Sommer Mehri-party and cameraman Samuel Samuel Rylstone went to find out why the town is so into its wheels. Masterton's newest skate park is the biggest in the Wellington region but the area actually has a long history when it comes to skating. We talked to local experts about what the skating scene has been like over the years. Peter Maxwell and Marie Loder know a thing or two about racing on wheels. The siblings were internationally acclaimed roller skaters. Their family even moved up from Christchurch because of the North Island skating facilities. Most of them was very dominant and more seen. Very good track. Very good skaters up here. And there was a lot of events in the North Island so that made them really really good so it was sort of Marston was real up for it. They won gold and silver in the 1980 World Speed Skate Championships held here in Masterton. They've got fond memories of the need for speed on wheels. F friendships. I just, you know, they were second to none. Wided up at Archives librarian Michelle Clorson says Masterton's Hot Wheels history goes back to 1876 when its first indoor roller skating rink opened. It took off. During the post-war depression, people who was struggling to feed themselves would still turn up at the rink. She says it was a similar story during the 1918 influenza pandemic. Where was basically another lockdown, which people have seemed to have forgotten about, in the Wydardapa, in all of the Wellington District Health Board, had closed down all businesses in all places of entertainment and amusement, skater rings but one of ours actually kept going. The skate park moved to its current location in 1959. The local bowl was even visited by world-renowned skateboarder Tony Hawk in the late 80s. Masterton's revamped skate park opened in February and is going down well with locals. Yeah, I'm really liking it. It's, um, the, like, the distance between obstacles is really good. There's lots of space for like other people to kind of be around you and you don't really get in other people's way and they don't get in your way. just like a nice change from other skate parks for sure. There's just bugs. Well, hell, hell. I've got that big bowl there, it's quite scary and stuff. I like the mega ramp probably, or the new punk track that they put in here. It's bigger, it's got more ramps, it's more complicated than the old one. Yes, challenging. There's a lot of holes to be poked in life for like rural small towns and their use of their spare time but there's not a lot offered or at least there wasn't here for a long time there wasn't a lot of alternatives before. Just a park in general one that doesn't destroy you when you fall off. The old one was extremely rough and would make a big mess when you have the ground. This you slide on a bit better. Yeah, like I said, mainly variety is what keeps everybody entertained. When it's more slippery, it's also more challenging and it's more fun. Because if it was just like, if it was easy, that'd be a bit boring, if you could always do it. So you like it to be a little bit challenging, but not too hard. We like challenges. The local council and police are facing their own challenges, with reports of young people behaving inappropriately at the park. Masterton District Council has just announced this afternoon that it's giving police the authority to trespass people who are badly behaved. Let's get some of your feedback now just on the interview before on the way we had a hot pools they're up for sale. This was in a says I broke my pelvis comprehensively on the black hole hydro slide I wasn't the only one. We've been talking about that slide today. Someone in the office was too chicken to go down it. And Rob's got in touch to say exceptionally unique real estate, real estate ease off the charts, police says Rob, a bit like being a little pregnant, hey. Someone else says, used to be a happy place, hotel camping ground, a hot, greedy buggers, just muck it up for everyone and reach its full potential, this person says, a number of exclamation marks and question marks. What about something that everyone can enjoy, not just something for the super-rich. On the Blackferns, Peter reckons, it's interesting to hear Wayne Smith describe the Blackferns as a team of girls and that they need to catch up to the competition. I thought the Blackferns was a women's team. Who needs to catch up? Cess Peter. On inflation, a person, listening points out that UK inflation is at 7% most European countries are over 6.5. It is not just New Zealand. R&S News at 6, good evening Kiyorutato. I'm Evie Ashton. Police have revealed that Taranaki man shot and killed by police on Saturday night wasn't armed. Chaos Price rammed a police car on State Highway 3 between New Plymouth and Waitera. Our Taranaki Wanganui reporter Robin Martin has more. Assistant Commissioner Sandra Vanibels says the 22-year year old's vehicle was undriveable after the collision. Carl Price then attempted to commandeer a car from members of the public who had stopped. Assistant Commissioner Venables says he was shot and killed trying to take control of one of these vehicles. She says he did not have a firearm and police did not recover any firearms from the scene. Mr Price's body was returned to his final yesterday following the completion of a post-mortem. The Act Party says it's not good enough for the finance minister to keep blaming international forces for New Zealand's high rate of inflation. Annual inflation has hit 6.9 percent, the biggest annual rise since mid-1990. Act leader David Seymour says the government has to take some responsibility. We need to accept that there is an international component to inflation, but there's also a strong domestic component and the government needs to take responsibility for that just as it blames the rest of the world before it's an important inflation component. David Seymour is proposing a cut to the middle-income tax rate, but the governments rejected that, saying it would result in austerity cuts to services like health or education. Social services are concerned people will try to fight through increased living costs and end up facing bigger money issues. Wellington City Commissioner Murray-Edridge says there are more people on low or middle incomes seeking support. I worry that we've got a community of people who are really really struggling. Firstly that we don't see them because they're invisible in our community and secondly we perhaps judge them for their circumstance and actually what we know is that the cost of living at the moment, the inflation, the cost of housing, means that life is really, really tough for people. Murray Edridge says for those facing the worst of it, life is becoming almost impossible. China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific will be high on the agenda as the Prime Minister meets with her Japanese counterpart for the first time today. While trade agreements in tariffs are the focus of her Tokyo trip, Jissindra Doon says Japan and New Zealand are both concerned about any escalating tensions in the Pacific. She says China has been increasingly assertive and countries will need to work closer with them. It's in all our interest to continue to repeat the same message. We want de-escalation, we want diplomacy and we want to see the following of the rules-based order. The meeting gets underway in a few hours. Ukrainian officials have offered to negotiate without any conditions the evacuation of civilians and military personnel from Marupol. It comes as Chechnya's leader, Ramzan Kaderov, predicts Moscow could seize the city as soon as tonight. The BBC's Lori Kellez has more. In war a declaration of optimism by any side should be treated with some skepticism but the church and leaders view that Maripol will be taken sooner rather than later might quietly be shared by Ukraine. Despite their refusal to surrender a military commander's plea for help yesterday gave real insight into the difficulty faced by those sheltering at the Azov-style steel plant. And Ukraine's uncharacteristic negotiation offer could be a sign of recognition that the opportunity to save Ukrainian lives there is becoming increasingly limited. A man has been arrested after a patrol car was rammed and another car smashed into during wild scenes on the roads in central Timaru this morning. The police say the 34 year old driver of a black Holden Commodore is facing multiple serious charges. Officers received multiple reports of the vehicle being driven dangerously through Timaru. A patrol car looking for it was then rammed in the suburb of Parkside. No one was injured. A short time later, about quarter to 12, the Holden went through the intersection of Arthur Street and State Highway 1 and hit another car. The second car's occupants were taken to hospital, but aren't badly injured. Scientists are trying to work out why so many Hector's dolphinsons have died in the past five months. Two more have been found dead on South Island beaches taking the toll since November 2014. Department of Conservation Marine Species Manager Katie Clemens Sealy says 12 of the dolphins are being examined by a pathologist at Massey University. And Blackfern Kendra Cox Edge is welcoming the appointment of former all- blacks coach Wayne Smith as coach of the New Zealand women's rugby Side, but says she's still sad that Glenn Moore has left. Smith replaces Glenn Moore who resigned following a scathing review into the Blackferns environment which was also highly critical of New Zealand rugby. Cox-Ege hopes more will be properly farewell at some stage. We haven't seen Glenn yet. in due course, we will do something for him when we get the opportunity that will come but I know a few of the girls have reached out where they need to and but yeah with Glenn we wish him all the best for his future endeavors and it's sad to see him go. That's the news. Tonight on nights Jan Bolwell and Kate Jason Smith, bringing Anzac stories to the theatre, our changing world is on the ice with the Antarctic Heritage Trust, restoring Scott's hut at Cape Evans. And then there's the final frontier of space bases Emily and Pierre Dalstrom, and why this country's satellite technology needs to be sustainable. But when it comes to blasting things into orbit, what is sustainable? On nights of Me, Brian Crump, after the news at 7, on Iron Z National. You're back on checkpoint with Lisa Owen next. First, the short forecast from Met Service to midnight Friday. From Northland to Waithomor, including Corombeau, Bay of Plenty, Tomaroui, Tomarou, and Topau, scattered as a period of rain tomorrow morning and early afternoon with possible thunderstorms and localized downpaws. Fine today for Gisbon and Hawks Bay, rain for a time tomorrow. From Taranaki to Wellington, also for Thayhape and Waited Upper, a few showers, a period of rain and tomorrow morning with heavy falls, then clearing later tomorrow, and then clearing later tomorrow. Malba Nelson, also from Bula to Fjordland. Heavy rain with possible thunderstorms and downpaws especially about the ranges easing to a few showers overnight. For Canterbury rain about the Alps spreading elsewhere this evening. Occasional rain or showers tomorrow clearing by the evening. Otago in Southland has periods of rain with heavy falls possible easing to a few showers tomorrow morning and for Deakoho, the Chatham Islands, cloudy periods, heavy rain developing tomorrow evening. It's coming up to seven minutes past six. We'll have news headlines for you at 6.30. Thanks Evie. who is to blame for skyrocketing inflation problems created overseas or the government due to its economic management. Annual inflation is at 6.9% while slightly below expectations. It's still the biggest annual rise since mid-1990. The biggest cost drive is food, fuel and housing. The government's blaming global economic challenges, but opposite from parties say it has to take some responsibility for the price increases which are causing real pain for many New Zealanders. Here's our political reporter Katie Scotch. Anyone stepping into a supermarket, a service station or trying to pay the household bills, will have noticed the eye-watering price hikes that show no sign of slowing. Finance Minister Grant Robertson says the government has taken steps to ease the pressure like the three-month discounts on fuel and public transport and the inquiry into supermarket competition. So there are short-term and long-term things we can do to help New Zealand through this but fundamentally this remains an inflation situation that's driven by global factors. He's blaming conditions overseas including supply chain shortages caused by the pandemic and the war for soaring inflation. What I take responsibility for is making sure that we manage our resources carefully and what I'd ask is what spending do people not want us to undertake. If you're thinking about the kinds of spending that a government might do that would be big enough to really have an impact on inflation, you're thinking about things like the wage subsidy scheme. Is that what people saying we shouldn't have done? National leader Chris Luxon says the responsibility lies a lot closer to home. Domestic inflation is a big part of our total inflation. It's at a record high of 6% the highest since records are being created and all of that's to do with a government that's addicted to spending. Act Leader David Seymour says it's not good enough for Mr Robertson to keep blaming international forces. We need to accept that there is an international component to inflation, but there's also a strong domestic component and the government needs to take responsibility for that just as it blames the rest of the world before it's an important inflation component. Green MP Julianne Gentis suggests the government titans its belt to help curb inflation. Where we could look at cutting wasteful spending are some of the big expensive motorway projects in the New Zealand upgrade program which were meant to be shovel-ready fiscal stimulus and have actually driven a huge amount of inflation in the infrastructure construction sector. The Mardi Party sees lower income Fano will be hit hardest by sky high prices driven largely by food, transport and housing. Co-leader Debenadiwapakaka says New Zealand's poorest need direct support. Final will do what they've been doing so far but worse, reprioritised their spending their budgets and they don't have the same room to manoeuvre budgets around and they are the ones who feel the pinch the most. The finance minister says while he acknowledges the pressure on many families, he argues the broader economy is in good shape with low unemployment and export and economic growth on the up. The government has shared which regions have been selected as the first locality networks of the new health system. It's exactly a year since the government announced it would scrap the country's 20 DHBs for a new entity, Health New Zealand. Health Minister Andrew Little was in Hoorifenwa today to explain how local voices will fit in the new system. Our political reporter Anna Kismith was there. Andrew Little, warmly welcome to Tetakeritangar or Kura Hopo, Horofenua's culture and community centre this morning. It set the stage for the latest update on the health reforms, keeping things local. Locality networks will be how communities, including EMI, have a say on what health services are provided for them and how networks will be how communities including EMI have a say on what health services are provided for them and how they will be provided. Come the 1st of July the country's 20 DHBs will be abolished and in their place localities. They'll be the new way regions organize health services for their communities. It's essentially a bottom-up approach. A locality coordinator will bring health providers, ewee, local authorities and social agencies together to identify what their community needs. From there, a plan will be developed, and this plan will form the basis of funding decisions by Health New Zealand and the Mardi Health Authority. It's a lot of change but Mr Little sees it puts communities at the centre of the health system. Like if you look at the Otara Papatoa Tory one there's sports clubs involved in that. So anything anybody actively involved in the community's well-being can participate and then talk about what is needed. The government anticipates there will be between 60 and 80 localities by July 2024. National's health spokesperson, Dr Shane Ritti, says it's a whole lot more bureaucracy. This is nothing new in this announcement other than the nine locations, but what it is is a really good example of why the health reforms will fail. It's just about layers and layers of bureaucracy. But there was general excitement felt by those on the front lines in Hordofenua today. Dyrump of the Muau-Paukau Tribal Authority sees the localities model as a chance for communities to shape their own services. This is time for us to learn from what's happened in the past, to understand and face into the scary statistics and realise that the only way forward is for that population, in this case in New Zealand and Maury and Pacifica, to take a greater level of participation in how those health services and outcomes need to work for them. It will take an enormous effort by an enormous number of people to make the system work. Health New Zealand's chief executive, Margie Arper's, only concern being the current system, can't change fast enough. No, I think the concern will be that we don't change ourselves to move fast enough for those localities. They've got incredibly aspirations that are fantastic for their communities and we want to move at the same pace to support them to achieve those goals. The Pi Order Healthy Futures Bill still has to pass through Parliament and Health New Zealand and the Maori Health Authority are still being formed. All this before the first of July. It is 14 minutes past six and you with checkpoints on Arranz National. They look a bit like something out of the Thunderbirds. Zero carbon electric passenger sea gliders and the ambition is to have them winging their way across New Zealand in less than three years on the back of a multi-million dollar deal. Starting fair in the price of about a block of cheese according to Ocean Flyer, the company behind the ambitious plan, using gliders to be developed by a US aerospace company regent. So, blue sky thinking or pie in the sky, operations manager John Hamilton is a former Air Force pilot, helicopter pilot and instructor and he's pretty confident they'll get it off the ground. We are initially to start by beating them out of Auckland and Wellington, but there are lots of other locations as well. Auckland and Wellington because we think the port facilities will enable us to pick up and drop off passengers from downtown. Say, in Auckland from the viaduct area in Wellington from virtually bottom of Centerport. The fairs are going to be very affordable. Something in the order of a 30-minute flight would cost you about $50 a seat. How can you make it that cheap? Because I imagine you need a bit of infrastructure. Yeah, we do need some infrastructure, but it's so affordable because it's electric propulsion. And yet it flies in ground effects, so that's a very efficient mode of sight. And so it will fly at about two meters above the water, and up to 180 knots. Okay, I'm gonna come back to that in a second, but first off, this thing, will they take off from water and land on water do they? Yes it's it operates in three modes it's from the first as a as a boat floating on the water on its hull as it accelerates and this depends entirely on the situation in the harbour but as it accelerates it rises on foils using the same technology that we're now all familiar with from America's Cup and then at about 45 to 50 knots it's wingy start to take the load and it flies out of the water and it's then flying in what's called in ground to about 10 metres above the fift. So if you want to be central city-based to attract kinds of customers. Do you have permission to take off from the harbour in Auckland and in Wellington or where do you plan to base yourself specifically? Well it's early days we have opened discussions with harbour companies. Most of the companies that we've spoken to have been very supportive and in fact find the prospect very exciting. So are these classified as boats or rather than planes? I mean are you governed by the CAA or what is the deal? The deal is an agreement between the International Phil Aviation Organization, ICAO, and the International Maritime Organization, the IMO, is that these things because they are wing in the ground effect, are to be regulated under the maritime rules and again we have open discussions with maritime New Zealand for what we have to do to get these airplanes, I call the airplanes because I'm a Navy, and get the airplanes certified and operating. So in a legal context they're literally flying boats, right? So given what you're talking about in terms of regulation, who qualifies as a pilot then? Yeah, pilots, a pilot, both here or maritime. I think it probably will be largely aviation-based experience. That was a healthy dose of maritime knowledge to be able to operate amongst ships and boats. You know Wellington Harbour and going over the Cook Strait it can be as rough as guts you know as Kurds we called it the Chunder Run. I mean how how one is these how these to go just 10 meters off the ocean? Yeah so first of all the foils enable you to get a smoother ride because they cut through the chop if you like in the harbour. Ten metres above the water are anticipating a very smooth ride and a very fast ride. It will of course be limitations and so for example if it says rougher day when the fairies don't sail anyway well then I doubt that we'd be sailing just as most airplanes don't operate out of Wellington when it's one of those days. We've had a lot of listeners already contacting us with questions so maybe let's deal with a few bird strikes dolphins and y and yachts. How are you going to avoid all of those things? Bird strikes is a relatively familiar problem for aircraft. The sea gliders will be built to the same standards as the aircraft has. So they'll have strength in the leading edges of the wings and the propellers. And I'll have strength in the perfect for the cockpit. We'll also be able to run the flaking lights, which end to the two birds, sea birds, away from it. I don't think we'll come anywhere near them. So John, if you flow in a prototype of this or anything close to this? No, because the only thing that's flying at the moment is a quarter-scale model, which is basically radio controlled. So no one's blown yet. So again, you're suggesting 2025 is a realistic date to get this up and running. Well that's what the manufacturers is promising us and we're confident that their skill set and their ability to produce is going to allow operators to take to a reason 2025. So hand on heart, you reckon it's more than just a dream? This is an exciting proposition to be able to bring zero emissions sustainable transport options to travel within New Zealand, which is affordable, fast and inefficient. And that is Ocean Flyer Ops Manager John Hamilton there. It is 20 past six. A city why COVID lockdown in Shanghai has been in place for 17 days and anger towards the government is beginning to spill out in public more and more. People have been confined to their homes without enough food or medicine and those who test positive for COVID-19 are sent straight to government handled isolation facilities. CNN's David Culver reports. Shangai residents pushing back after nearly three weeks of lockdown. These videos circulating on social media show people confronting police for being forced from their homes. These are not folks with COVID-19, but rather people whose apartments are being turned into government quarantine facilities to cope with a surging COVID cases. The rising tensions come as Chinese officials vow to send every positive case of COVID-19 and any close contact to government quarantine, no matter the age. Here you see an elderly man shuffling towards a group of other senior citizens. Some in their 90s, most in wheelchairs, transferred from their nursing home to this isolation facility after testing positive. Video shared from inside another center shows elderly patients seemingly left unattended. Cots set up in the halls with wooden boards and thin sheets as betting. Since the start of this outbreak in early March, more than 400,000 cases have been reported in the city, according to China's National Health Commission, and most in this metropolis of more than 25 million people are still in strict lockdown. CNN's been living through it. We've mostly been sealed inside our homes, let out only for mandatory COVID tests, and the occasional government distribution of groceries. Chicken to potatoes. Last week we had a brief taste of freedom. I could step out of my apartment and walk all the way to the compound gate. Still double-locked. But since a reversal for our community, new restrictions have us sealed back inside our properties. The draconian and inconsistent policies, coupled with a constant uncertainty, weigh heavily. People tired, pushing back, physically, and through words. These banners appeared on the streets of Shanghai in the cover of night. This one calling residents to resist the limitless lockdown. This one reading, people are dying, referring to the dire struggle to secure food and medical care. Online, a flood of frustration surfacing on China's heavily controlled internet. On Chinese social media platform Webo, users began quoting the first sentence of China's national anthem. It reads, rise those who don't want to be enslaved. A rally call no longer aimed at foreign oppressors, but rather Beijing's pandemic response and its harsh restrictions. That line now censored. Some residents even boldly calling out Chinese officials for a perceived hypocrisy. This person wearing the photo of one of China's foreign ministry spokesperson who repeatedly accused Western government's COVID response of harming people's well-being. The sarcastic critique shared repeatedly online. The backlash likely to worsen as the weeks long lockdown drags on, further damaging China's economic engine. Implementing the strategy in an excessive manner myself could lead to exactly what the zero COVID strategy wants to avoid. The growing dissent calls into question China's zero COVID strategy at a critical time. Later this year, President Xi Jinping is expected to assume an almost unprecedented third term, paving the way for him to rule for life. But the highly anticipated coordination now marred by discontent over a policy so closely tied to the people's leader. Hollywood actor Johnny Deaf has been telling a court he turned to drugs and alcohol because of constant clashes with his ex-wife and beheard. Deaf is suing her for defamation after an article she wrote for the Washington Post in which she describes herself as a victim of domestic violence. He denies any abuse. The BBC's David Sillito has been following the case. All right? You're ready for the jury? Okay. Johnny Depp, back on the witness, turned for questions about a relationship that he says was controlling and belittling. As he settled down, there was only the briefest glance across the court towards where his ex-wife Amber Hurd was watching. I was sort of not allowed to be right, not allowed to have a voice. So at a certain point, when that, when what enters your mind is, you start to slowly realize that you are in a relationship with your mother. Day one was all about the big picture. His childhood, his lifestyle, his personality, his drug use. Day two is focused rather more on the specific allegations. He was asked if he had ever assaulted Ms. Hurd. He said, no, rather he was the one who was punished and beaten at one point acting out what he said happened during an argument she squared off at me in the doorway of our bedroom and I said what do you what do you want to do hit me again would you like to hit me again? and I said go to hit me again? And I said go ahead, hit me. Bam! bottle that was thrown at him. Another of an injury to his face. The court was then played a recording of one of their conversations. You didn't get punched. You got hit. I'm sorry I hit you like this. But I did not punch you. I did not fucking deck you. I was hitting you. I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was. But you're fine. I did not hurt you. hand was but you're fine I did not hurt you I did not punch you I was hitting you how what am I supposed to do do this I'm not sitting here bitching about it am I you are that's the difference between me and you you're your baby this was he says typical him retreating trying to escape from a relationship that he said had becoming demeaning aggressive violent throughout all, his ex-wife watched will hear Amber Hurd's version of events in the days to come. Prince Harry says America now feels like home to him. Speaking in a TV interview with the US Network NBC, the Duke of Sussex says he's trying to ensure the Queen is protected and surrounded by the right people. The BBC's Nicholas Mitchell has more. His relations with the rest of the royal family have been strained of late, but Harry has remained on good terms with his grandmother the Queen. The two hadn't met for a year, until last week when Harry and Megan were en route to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games. They broke their journey to visit the Queen at Windsor Castle, and according to Harry, the meeting went well. It was just so nice to see her. You know, she's on great form. We have a really special relationship. We talk about things that she can't talk about with anybody else. She always got a great sense of humor with me, and I'm making sure that she's protected and got the Harry's comment that the Queen was on great form is reassuring given the concerns about her health but quite what he meant by suggesting he's the person ensuring the Queen is protected and has the right people around her is unclear on his own future plans Harry seems very settled in California. Home for me now is for the time being for this it really, and it feels that way as well. But did he think he would come to Britain to attend the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June? I don't know yet, there's lots of things, security issues and everything else, so this is what I'm trying to do, trying to make it possible, your dad. I mean, for me, the moment, I'm here... relations with his father and brother was deflected. Do you miss your brother, your dad? I mean, for me, at the moment, I'm here, focus on these guys. I get back and my focus is my family, who I miss massively. You do. Finally, how much did he feel his mother's presence in his life? It's constant. has been over the last two years, more so than ever before. It's almost as though she's done her, done her bit with my brother and my brother, with my brother, and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, and now, It has been over the last two years, more so than ever before. It's almost as though she's done her bit with my brother and now she's very much like helping me, got him set up, now she's helping me set up. That's what it feels like, you know. His life of service continued, Harry said, it had just relocated to the United States. Let's get some more of your thoughts on why we had other hot pools north of Auckland and what should happen to them. Tarwida has got in touch to say the end of your trip to Waywida was the only reason I did road patrol. The contrast of the freezing mornings and the warmth of the pools was quite retirement place for Burma the elephant are a relaxed pace warm water room to Rome ideal says Andrew I think you're probably right. Paul's gone in touch say a lot of countries don't have high inflation that's headline numbers today 6.9% percent in Denmark 1.6 it it's not management, it's the system says poor. Julie says the richer, simply getting richer. That is about all we've got time for. The late news team will keep you updated throughout the night, don't forget you can catch up on checkpoint on Spotify, Apple or wherever you get your podcast. Cote Popapur, from 5am tomorrow, we'll be crunching the numbers behind the highest level of inflation in three decades. And when I've just noticed, someone's got in touch with a really important query. Nita from Fankaree says, I'm interested to know which member of the team was too chicken to go down the why we're a slide. Oh, got to go. Evie's here."}
