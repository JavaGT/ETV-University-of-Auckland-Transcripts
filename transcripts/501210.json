Kano, could the days of calling ourselves New Zealand be numbered? Yeah, New Zealand, Mike. Possibly. That is the hope of one man who is travelling the country. He's got a plan, a pledge and a billboard on wheels. New Zealand, named after the Old Zealand, the least populated province of the Netherlands. Like the Gore of Europe. But we have a name, one that's really ours, Al-Teroa. Ootaki's Hohepa Thompson, aka Hori, is on a road trip to help make it the official name of our country, driving from the capital to Cape Ranga, campaigning with this epic artwork. Hori is supporting a petition started last September by Tepati Māori to change our official name to Al-Teroa by 26. He says they've got over 80,000 signatures so far. Last August, the project hired an independent polling company. We asked Kiwis if they'd come halfway. Would you support our Teira becoming an official name of the country alongside New Zealand? Sixty-four percent of you said yes. And so did those on the street today. Yeah. Why? Well, they were here first. And it's a great sounding name. I think it's progressive and forward thinking and inclusive of all people in our country. I'm used to New Zealand, but change is good. Not everyone agrees though. I like New Zealand, I think it should be kept the same way. No. Because it's New Zealand, not HR. I mean, it not just marries over here. We've been a fortune making New Zealand no one around the world and now we're going to change the name. That's a pretty crazy thing to do. Well joining us now is Hoheper Thompson who is on this roadie and Hoheper when you meet someone like those people that we just heard in our story who isn't on board with you. How do you deal with that? It's a hard one. All we try to offer is some maauranga, so some knowledge from our side of the story, whether they like to listen to that or not. And saying that, you know, ignorance is bliss, and people like that, they just will keep to themselves, they just want to keep that chat, okay. But I feel that Al-Tiru is, they just want to keep that chat, okay, but I feel that Altearoa is, you know, and our country is progressive enough to kind of have this discussion. I think the most positive thing is, you know, talking with friends, even my best friend, didn't actually know the story around how the country was renamed from Alteoroa. So, you know, having those Khorero are really positive. And, you know, it's just that little simple knowledge that they have that switches and goes, oh, right, okay. There's a lot of people, especially in our generation, that don't actually know the history of the renaming of this country. How do you help average, like, white women from Christchurch in their mid-50s, get their pronunciation right? Well, I could pick on someone there if you want. Please do. Go. Okay, Patty, we'll go with you, eh? It's not the first time today. Oh, my man. So say I was to punch Patty in the arm, all right. He'd say a few words. One of them could be al. That's how I do it. Al, sounds like al. He might have a few tears after that. So tear, oh, tear. And, you know, he probably thinks he got the rough end of the stick or the raw deal. So raw, but roll that a, are raw put that all together pereo Altearoa boom nice how would you feel if we landed on Aotearo in New Zealand if we did both so my cordial for that is to make them both English my only thing is that So my Kordero for that is to Fakhamanah both Ingoa. My only thing is that Aotearo is acknowledged so this is the point of this whole petition is to make that change and allow that history to be acknowledged. And do you feel optimistic? Do you feel that this change can happen? Yeah, I think I've felt like a monumental kind of shift within Tiaw Maori and Tiao Pāke. So I feel that I'm pretty confident that I will see this in my lifetime. And I hope it can be celebrated by all people of Aalue. Well, awesome, Kau Papa, bro. Thank you so much for talking to us tonight. and I hope it can be celebrated by all people of Aalteoroa. Well, awesome, co-papa, bro. Thank you so much for talking to us tonight. Thank you. Hello, he's Aaltaireo. Kaki-i. All right, this is the project, and Justine Smith is with us. All right, I mean, I'm totally for the name change and I want to go with the, you know, what I call the double-banger Al-Teroa, New Zealand. But I think to get everybody on board, we really would have to go with a referendum so people didn't feel like it was foisted on them so that they felt invested and it had mana. The problem is, we are absolutely crap at referendums in New Zealand. So bad. Could have had a prettier flag. Could have had people not going to jail for using marijuana and here we are. It's so fascinating. I grew up in Christchurch in the 70s, right? And I didn't even know that Christchurch had a Māori name. And I think people have to remember that we're not changing, we're actually reinstating was already there first, so that's important. That's so lovely, yeah, it's not a change, it's a correction. But people are resistant to change in their own lives, right, things that are different that they think have been that way forever. But I have thought of an upside, if we do go to Alta Rua and that is we'll be up the top and the drop-down menus online. Oh, real. One of the first out at the Olympics just behind Afghanistan, I think. Perfect, absolutely perfect. Well, while we wait for the name to go back to its original form, let's do a show tonight. We're going to ask entertainment guru, Kate Roger, why all we're getting right now a prequel, sequel, spin-offs and when on earth will this change that's coming up next and what if you could make your office anywhere you wanted it to be? We'll take a look at the rise of the modern office just ahead. Yeah, a lot of people on that are working from home whereas I zig when other people zag. I'm actually doing home stuff at work. Kids, shut the door, I'm not hitting the whole street. It's time now for the daily dose. I say a dog is a human's best friend. Well, sometimes a full day of being friendly to humans can take its toll. Look at this dog. I just want a bit of space. Can you give me some time on my own? It's exhausting. Fetch your own stick. Next up, only an idiot would go outside to record a storm, but he's not the biggest idiot in this next clip. Yes. Look this guy. Here's a guy vowing his lawn in this next clip. Yes. Look at this guy. Here's. A guy mowing his lawn in the middle of the store. If that was me, my neighbour would still be telling me to keep the noise down. And finally tonight, we have a great video of a little kid trying mushy peas for the very first time. See if you can work out whether he likes it. Oh. Yep. Yum. I had the same reaction the first time I saw a baby. And that was your daily dose. All right, absolutely amazing dose. Now these days, it's not enough to make a movie. You've got to have a whole universe to mine for endless, endless content. Truly, friends, we are living in the time of the spin-off. Once upon a time, you had to wait at least three years for a new Star Wars film. But it's a whole other year. For 20 long, horrific years, all that existed were those first three films. Sorry, nerdlingers, the two E-Watt films of the holiday special, we're not counting those. The loin is very tasty and serves for nicely. Then came the prequel trilogy, followed by the sequel trilogy, followed by the Han Solo prequel film, the Bleak War spin-off, the kid's Krypton Factor Show, Adventures of Bucket Man, Adventures of the Other Bucket Man, Sadd Man, Saddellot show, a forthcoming show about cheekbones lady, a forthcoming spy show, which is a spinoff of the Bleak War spin-off. And most of this has been released in just the last five years. There are now Star Trek spinoff, walking dead spin-offs, there's even a goddamn Pingu spin-off. Pingu in the city! Why are there so many spin-offs there's even a goddamn Pingu spin-off. Pingu in the city! Why are there so many spin-offs? Love him or hate him, we just have to look at the model that Marvel has given us. They've just extracted from the comics, and starting with Iron Man, they've continued to draw from a universe of characters that are all interconnected. We have to see every single film and every single spin-off because we're hungry to see where they're going to go and we're just kind of a little bit in love with them and we just can't get enough of it. She's right. The top 10 films last decade, all of them are spin pre-sequel remake ones, which is why it seems like there's a new Marvel show on Disney Plus every month. Streaming services are basically Jabber the Hut. They need to guzzle new content all the time. The streaming services are very, very competitive, and they need good titles and content. And the big franchises like Star Wars are an obvious winner. The end goal for the streamers is subscribers. So they don't indulge as much as the big marketing budgets of the studios where they have to get millions and billions of us to go and see the latest Top Gun or the latest end game. They can roll it out across Disney Plus or a Netflix show or Amazon Prime. And of course, if you enjoyed this movie, you feel kind of obligated to watch this series that features that character you liked in that movie, which also features another character who has their own spin-off show. But for those who've been out in the desert existing on scraps for decades, this is the best possible time to be alive. Something as a youngest, the house fan, Andy, would have conceived having this most material just immediately accessible in the way that it currently is. A lot of fans describe it has been a great time to be a Star Wars fan. Yeah, the Star Wars movie. I get a bit confused. It's a bit overwhelming, especially in that Avengers universe. Like, we'll open up Netflix or whatever and see 20 movies. I'm like, I don't know which ones I've seen. They're all slightly different versions of the same thing as far as I'm. Sometimes I'm halfway through a movie and then I'm like, no, I have seen this one. That's such a complicated world too. I think original spinoffs, like I remember Happy Days, their spin-off is Levern and Shirley. Easy to understand. I mean, when it's this and that's... This is Corby will remember. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I probably should let you guys give you guys the head up, actually. Heads up with a little TV show. I'm going to be doing a spinoff of this called The ProGES. Oh, nice. Okay, looking forward to that. For a decade, Sam Sharp has been an anti-abortion protester, bringing his sign where he needs it. There it is, there's his little sign, but it's more than just a joke. We'll have this story next on the project. Enter into your very own universe and get deeper into what you're into. The project, proudly powered by the new Dell XPS.

But then I discovered other ancestors I had no idea about, who lived in Calabria around the time of the Italian unification. With ancestry DNA, I'm not just discovering more about people and places from my past. I can even find new DNA connections to build my family story today. There could be more to your story too.

Now should you ask your boss to let you work here on the beach at the badge or just in your lounge as you wait for the kids to get home? It's becoming a reality for more and more Kiwis. And we'll take a look next. First though, a couple of stories making headlines for Tuesday the 31st of May. Christchurch Hospital has been forced to postpone major surgeries because of high numbers of sick patients and staff. They're currently at 112% occupancy, while Canterbury District Health Board were down 170 workers today. Health staff say it's one of their most challenging winters ever. Supermarket chain, ALDI, may be coming to New Zealand. Acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson told R&Z the discount store is one of the players interested in our market. And if that happened, ALDI would join American favourite Costco, whose massive Auckland shop opens in a few months. And a photographer has revealed how to take a really nice passport photo you won't hate for the next 10 years. He says that lighting's key, avoid harsh room light or the built-in flash on your camera. Instead, find a window that is not getting direct sunlight and face that so that the light is hitting you front on. Get your photographer to stand about 1.5 metres away and then zoom in on your face. And once you've relaxed and done a few blinks, you should be camera ready. Right. Wait, what? What? I didn't know you could do that. I thought you had to go to the post office and line up with everyone standing there parcels or they'd drop down a screen that makes you feel really embarrassed. I know. Or the pharmacy. That's another classic. Yeah, the pharmacy. It's just after you'd watched Happy Days, was it? No, Jazzy, I didn't know that you could take your own either until the last one. I thought they were hard out about, you know, the... No, I actually tried this, and, you know, this is what I came up with, and I don't look like a psychopaths at all. Dear, dear. It's a tough one, is it? I've got my own passport photo in there. I think we've got that. This is my effort. So many rules, but you follow them online, you can do it. Or, Corby Lifehack, what I've done, never go anywhere, don't need a passport anymore. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Doing that last couple of years. Amazing. Now a lot has changed in the past two turbulent COVID years, nowhere more so than in the office. Some workplaces now just have a quarter of their staff on site. So what sort of worker have you become? Office work used to be thought of as a bit dull, you know, that dreaded 9 to 5. Or worse than that, the awful pressure to put in long hours. I almost forgot, I'm also going to need you to go ahead and come in on Sunday, too, okay? Now in what could be one of the few upsides of COVID, the whole office work thing has really turned on its head. I come into the office once, twice a week, at the moment. Yeah, me personally, I probably do about three days in the office and two days from home. It's all about choice, and that's what's changed the most in the last couple of years, is that people want choice. And the choice for most employees here is to work from home. Prior to COVID, we've seen people coming into the office about 60, 40, and sort of post-COVID, that's ended up being about 40-60 where people are choosing to work from home a little more. Over at Tech Company Zero they used to have 70% of their staff working on site. Now there's just 16% working in the Auckland office and 20% in Wellington. We have a complete remote policy. So you can choose where you work from at the moment. There is no requirement to come into the office. So what we're seeing is people are coming into the office for part days. So they're able to drop their kids off at school in the mornings. They might come in for a couple of important meetings and then spend the afternoon working at homes. But for those of us non-office workers watching here, how much work is actually going on at home? Are you doing as much? Are you being as productive? And for most of our people, they're telling us at times, they're more productive at home. If they're hanging out the washing in between meetings, it's no big deal. Yeah, I think that the old thought process of people are slaking off at home, I think those days have done. Businesses all over the world have been working their way through lockdowns and long-term office closures. Now, some like Airbnb have ditched plans to return to the office altogether, telling their 6,000 employees they can work remotely forever. Over in London, one major law firm told their staff to stay home indefinitely too. But only if they take a 20% pay cut. And a methodology and thought process like that is, that's baked in the 1960s. Okay, let's park that for now, circle back and move forward because there's one thing that hasn't changed around here, and that's a love for office jargon. Hybrid workers, all the remoties. I heard a new one the other day, which I hadn't heard from heard, but you're a twat, which is a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday employee, BRB, be right back. Or Yom, you're on mute. Over summer we talked about free range working and people if they were lucky enough to have a batch would often work from their batch or, you know, we had someone working from a caravan at one time. So it's really nice to be able to give people those options for true flexibility rather than just work or home. The office has really come a long way, so how does your work compare? You know what? I really missed the office and I want it back, you know, I want to get back into it. And I think the way to do it would be an anchor day, what I call an anchor day. Everybody's got to come in, make it school hours, come in, smash it out, be a psychopath, psychological warfare at a meeting straight off the bat, then malicious gossip, then backstab the boss, then salacious but true gossip, then order to come together, do some epic mahi and then bang, go. People can pick up their kids, get it all done in one go. I picked up something else from that, actually, use you know how we say talk to the hand when you don't want to talk so I'm going to go yom now you're on mute yom no actually think yom cool we'd work better with yom yom yom what every protester needs is an equally dedicated and zalice counter-protester artist sam sharp is one of those. He's known as the Dix guy. Because for over a decade, he has been trolling a group of anti-abortion protesters with his own sign. Yeah, it's his dix. He does this to support women coming to Deneidan Hospital, who have already, obviously, made a really difficult choice. And he's joining us now, Sam Sharp, take us back to 10 years ago. What made you do this? I was just passing by Dunedin Hospital, going in to get a coffee in the foyer. And I hadn't actually seen these people before. And I just thought it might have been a protest for something. But as I got closer, I could see these sort of quite quite horrific signs and I was just amazed that it was little old Dunedin had this kind of American style anti-abortion protest going on so yeah I wipped home and and whipped up a sign and what was in it for you I mean was it personal for you in some way? Yeah, well, my family history is we all came out from England and my nana used to tell me stories about her time before the war in England and her mother had to get an abortion. They already had too many children and back then it was illegal so you went to somebody's house and had it done and she died of sepsis a couple of days later leaving my nana without a mum at 11 in 1939 and then her dad went to war so that was my great-grandmother Alice so I kind of thought about her when I did this think that it helps women seeing your sign who are coming into the clinic? I do. I really do. And I've had so many women come up and hug me, quite emotional. And the last thing you want to see is you head in for this decision that you've made is to see these images, a lot of which are fake and manufactured to be quite confrontational. Despite being on opposite sides, I imagine after 10 years you must have formed a bit of a relationship with the protesters, do you? Do you turn up and say, Gidey, Steve, and they're like, hey, Sam. One of the younger guys sort of tries to chat to me. He's got a sign that says, smile, your mum chose life. Wow. So I am civil with him, but more often than not, I think they've moved him along and put me next to a sort of a grumpy guy. And we talk about the creation of life and really deep and meaningful conversations. But as soon as I mentioned that the world was six billion years old, I lost him. So I kind of had to do. What made you decide on that simple one-word sign? I pondered it for a while there, Patty, and I kind of thought I could do anything artsy, something really long-winded that no one was going to read, and then I thought, Dick's just sprung to mind, and it's kind of funny, it's not that offensive, and Dix seemed to be the problem that's causing a lot of these situations as well. So it kind of all went together. Well, Sam, thanks for holding up the sign, and thanks for talking to us tonight. Thank you so much for having me on your show at dinner. I love this. I mean, you should be allowed to protest, but you should also get what's coming to you. I once saw a group of anti-abortion protesters in Auckland, and I'd just been shopping, and I had an apple with a bite out of it, and so I biffed it really hard at them. And turns out I'm quite a good shop. So, yeah. And it obviously hit the ground very close to them. Yeah, yeah. And it obviously hit the ground very close to them. Yeah, hypothetically. Yeah, yeah. Okay. There's more to come on the project. Maybe just remind yourself. It's their first time in the Master Chef kitchen. So cold. To face their first challenge. The mystery box. Yeah.
