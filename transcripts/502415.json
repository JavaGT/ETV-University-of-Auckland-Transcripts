Well, it's good for earning interest on your savings. For those with a mortgage, the news is less welcome. After plateauing for more than a year, we were warned it would get steeper. Then, last August, the OCR went up. Then it kept going up. And up, and up, and up. And today, it went up again. It's in an effort to tackle inflation, because that too is continuing to climb. So with the official cash rate now at 2.5%, what does it mean for our pockets and is a reprieve inside? And someone that can shed some light on this is principal economist at Infometrics. Brad Olson, great to talk to you again, Brad. Tell us, why is our cash rate gone up again? Well, we continue to see the pressures of inflation building across the economy. The Reserve Bank, their job is to get inflation under control. They're not currently achieving it, and so they're working incredibly hard to get inflation back within that target ban. To do that, they've got to lift the official cash rate, they've got to drag down just how much activity is out there in the economy, trying to bring the economy down from a rolling boil down to more of a simmer because at the moment we're overc over cooking. We're doing too much work with too little resources. We don't have the people. We don't have the materials. We've got to bring that temperature of the economy down just a touch. Brad, what does it mean for homeowners who are already feeling the squeeze? There are still some very challenging times out there for people who have got a mortgage because those mortgage rates will continue to rise. Expectations going forward are that we're going to see further increases. Remembering at the moment your one year fixed mortgage rate is still well over 5%. 12 months ago it was only at 2.2 so it's now a lot more expensive to get into a house. As we continue to go forward people are going to have to pay more for their mortgage and have less money left over for other things. That's going to help us bring back that temperature of touch and just try and get households into figuring out making sure they're paying for the essentials to start with and spending less materially on other bits and pieces, particularly the likes of tourism and retail. Inflation rate, Brad, is it a 30-year high, 6.9%. What factors have contributed to that? And is it just a problem here or is it a 30-year high, 6.9%. What factors have contributed to that? And is it just a problem here, or is it a problem globally? There are huge pressures of inflation, both here at home domestically, but also wider global challenges. 6.9% is the current rate. I'm worried that it's going to go to 7.3% when we get numbers out early next week for the middle of 2022. Realistically, we know that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has started to put pressure on. Fuel prices are a lot higher, so is the likes of food. But here domestically at home, we know as well the cost of building is incredibly higher than what it was 12 months ago. So there's a lot that's coming forward. Effectively, what we've seen in recent times is both here in New Zealand and across the world. We've tried to pour a lot of money, a lot of support into our economies, and currently we're over-cooking it. So we do see that necessary need to pull back. That is going to mean that people have got to spend less, but at the moment we're trying to do too much with too little. Okay, give us a silver lining. Has there been anything positive that's come out of today's news? I mean, it's certainly an expectation that we hope that this is a reserve bank taking inflation seriously and that we will see inflation settle back. What it realistically does mean, though, is that New Zealand households are going to be looking out for different opportunities because trying to grow this year is going to be more difficult. Interest rates are going up that makes it more expensive to borrow. Better for savers, though, but I think what you're going to see is people casting their eye out there. The housing market is down. The stock market doesn't always look great, but there are some big opportunities. People are going to have to work a lot harder to achieve that growth in 2022. Thanks so much for your time tonight, Brad. Good to talk to you. Thank you. ASB in 7 Sharp, keeping you one step ahead. Thank you. A.S.B. and 7 sharp. Keeping you one step ahead. To news that's probably a little unsurprising, hangar is real. Your scientists have just found a proven link between our hunger and our emotions. It means the term hangary is now a scientific reality. But what does it mean? And how will a diagnosis help? I'm sorry, I'm sorry to sweat. The term hangary has been around for a while. But it's only just been proven to be a real scientific thing. In an international study, 64 adults recorded their emotions and feelings of hunger five times a day for three weeks. It was found that as our hunger levels rise, so too do our feelings of irritability. So the more hungry people felt, the more angry or hangary they became. But why has it taken so long to prove? And how do we keep the wolf at bay? And for more on this, we're joined by nanotechnology, Dr. Michelle Dickinson. Great to see you again, Michelle. Now, it's almost in a time. I feel like I just need to check how you're feeling before we carry on. This is the time of day that I usually have a snack right before dinner, apple and some cheese, and then my husband complains I'm going to spoil my appetite. So I'm feeling good. I'm about to snack. Great. You're not hangary. But can you believe that hangar has only just been proven? I'm going to spoil my appetite. So I'm feeling good. I'm about to snack. Great. You're not hangary. But can you believe that hangar has only just been proven? So no. I mean, it's something we've used colloquially for so long. And when I read the research paper, I was amazed that nobody had actually done this study in real life before. But that's science for you. It needs a passionate scientist to commit their time and their money to look at something. So I'm glad it's official now. So Michelle, what's happening to our bodies to make us feel angry when we're hungry? So the prevailing theory right now is about blood sugar levels. So your limbic system is a part of your brain that's associated with hunger, but also anxiety, fear and anger. And the theory is that as your blood sugar level drops because you're hungry, your brain doesn't work as well because it needs glucose to fuel itself. And therefore, it goes a little bit out of whack, making you a little bit more angry or anxious because you're hungry. Does knowing that there is a scientific term actually help us? I think it does because now you have an official excuse for stopping that meeting at 11 o'clock and going, actually, we need some snacks, let's not make some big decisions here, let's have something to eat and then come back to the table. I think having the official scientific work is going to help you. So Michelle, are there other areas that could benefit from this research? So my passion is childhood education and I think there's a real association with poor behavior in classrooms and children going to school hungry. So as you think about how do we make sure our tamariki have enough food to eat, we also have to think about with anger the consequences of are they learning well enough and therefore are they behaving well in classrooms? So I think we feed our children well, they'll learn well, and hopefully it's a good outcome for all. Thanks for your time, Michelle. Enjoy your cheese and apples. That will do, thanks. Bye. You're hungry right now, aren't you? Yeah. I can just tell. From Zambia to New Zealand to the bright lights of New York, Kiwi singer Emily Amuela is truly living her best life. Anna Burns-Francis caught up with a former busker turned opera singer to celebrate her biggest performance yet. Bright Lights, big city. And a place one Kiwi singer now calls home. It's a great city. It's a great city. It's a crazy city. It's very intense. I think it definitely took a few years for me to get settled into the pace and the culture here, I think. Emily Muehler, all the way from Tawa, is singing up a storm across America. Like this year, I'm going to spend eight weeks in Chicago, and then I'm going to send six weeks in Detroit, and then I don't know where I'm going to be next. She started early. Here's Emily on stage as a child in Zambia. She came to New Zealand, aged eight, joined the school choir, and went busking. But she never had any formal training until she caught the eye of an Aussie opera fan who went on to be her benefactor funding her studies in America. Yeah, the music school helped me to be like, okay, I'm a professional. So even though sometimes I think, oh, I'd like to just go out and busking again. Good luck, great talent, and a whole lot of practice has finally paid off. Emily's just finished the Detroit Opera season of X, the life in times of Malcolm X, and the chorus of the Mets Porgy and Bess, a job she couldn't have even imagined in her wildest dreams. I think for a long time I had a little imposter syndrome almost, because I hadn't even been to music school. I did a humanities degree in New Zealand. But Emily's dream has come true. It's so competitive, and there's so many people buying for that spot. I'm a soprano, there's like 10 million of us. So there's just a lot of competition. I never thought I'd be at the mat. And then suddenly to be backstage and to be on the stage and have the curtain lift in the audience and think, wow, I'm seeing the mat from this side. Which I never thought. It was incredible experience, yeah. And she can't wait to be back. You hope to head headline here one day? One day. Scary to say that. In the meantime, she's keeping up her Kiwi connections, representing Aotearo in New Zealand at official events. And rehearsing for that big moment. She very kindly let us join a recent afternoon session. I have had some piano lessons. You have. More than I have, probably. I don't want to be over confident about this, but I don't know I play the song I'm most familiar with. And you can see if you recognise it. Okay. Okay, you're ready? Isn't that just that what you do when you're like well it's not hard to see I wouldn't last long in a city that's brimming with talent there's always something to see to do to experience for the audience and the artist. There's a reason why so many artists flock to New York, because there's just this creative energy, there's so many different places to get inspiration, there's so many different people to collaborate with. So even though it's a struggle a lot of the time, it's still a great place to be. Emily in Paris? Maybe one day. For now, this is Emily in America. Oh, and she's so good. Faya Kone.

Her son Kane was born with a significant disability and tragically she lost her oldest boy, Isaac, to that son condition. To have had two little boys with this very rare condition, the doctors had said lightning doesn't strike twice. Never woe me. Never ever woe me. Never. Resilient. Very resilient. Very resilient. Very resourceful. Gets on with life. Makes the most of every minute. Sarah values people. She is always thinking of others and what she can do for them. I think you quite like her. Yeah. Definitely. Now this good as gold surprise is a one-shot wonder no second chances here so Sarah's an avid runner and we know she'll be coming along this pathway sometime soon and we'll then waylay her just over there hopefully her little jig clearly intended for us although she has no clue what we're up to. You're Sarah. Yes. Cain's mum? Yes. Fancy meeting you out here. Good run? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Nice one. How do you know me? We were just out loitering, looking for good people to talk to. Oh, yeah. And we found you. Perfect. And in fact, the last person we've met told us that you have an incredible heart, that you're always looking out for other people, even though you've got so much on your own plate, Sarah. Yeah, probably. The challenge is posed by young Kane and his medical situation and the fact that you lost another son to exactly the same condition. Yes. And still you've got time for others. It's my love language that gives me pleasure and joy to be able to give to other people. Sarah, I'm Michael from Seven Sharp. I kind of recognise you, but I didn't know how you knew me. And one of my great joys is finding deserving people for a segment called ASB Gooders' Gold. And one of my great joys is finding deserving people for a segment called ASB Gooders' Gold. And today, Sarah, it's all about you. For your wonderful community soul and spirit. Oh, thank you. In recognition of that, the ASB is happily sending $10,000 to allay. And we've heard that that might be just what you're looking for to get a new super-duper buggy. Totally is. So that young Kane can come out and keep running in our races with us. I'm so shocked. A new buggy's what I dream of for Kane. He's got too long for it. When I'm out running with him, he gives me everything I need to get to the finish line. I can hear him in the buggy doing these little squeals going, ah! When we're going over the gravel or when we're on bumps. He has his own metal collection. I'm very proud that I've been able to help him achieve that. If you see a need in the community, you have to be involved. I need to be involved in giving projects, yes. As an example, I make these tiny little baby beds for premature babies who have grown their angel wings and passed away and they allow the mothers to hold their babies and give them cuddles. My heart's filled to be able to make them. Promise you'll send us some video the first time you cross the finish line with cane in the new buggy. 100%. 100% I will. If you know a deserving New Zealander, nominate them at ASBgoodasgold.com.n.z. We should have probably warned you to get a couple of tissues. We had to get a couple of tissues too. What an amazing person, Sarah is. What an amazing person, Sarah is, that's right. Now, what's big, green, and can carry a tune? No, it's not the giant dancing veggies. They used to have it, Big Fresh. Shrek the Musical began its tour of the country last night. And it's Ben Hurley found out, getting into costume and treading the boards is harder than it looks. In a matter of hours, the Kitty Takanwa Theatre will be packed for the opening performance of Shrek the musical. I can't believe that the dream is about to become reality. It's mind-blowing. How excited are you that you're in the first performance today of this musical? So excited. Yeah? Yeah. So exciting. Do? Yeah, so exciting. Do you know how many people are going to be out there? No idea. Do you want to know? Really? I can't, won't tell you. I won't tell you. But it's lost. The set and props cost over a million dollars, including Delilah. This is Delilah the Dragon. This is one of the elements of the show. We wanted it to be replicated as close to the movie that everybody remembers. This is an o-ar moment of the highest order. This takes six people to operate. I'm actually her backside. That's probably the heaviest part to lift. And if you think that's elaborate, wait until you see the costumes. There's a cow, which is the big piece that goes over top first. They put glue on my face. And then we have a prosthetic nose, cheeks, chin and forehead. Kind of like a home DIY joby. Yeah, yeah. And you're going to do this every day. I'll be in this from sort of 8 o'clock in the morning to, God, when people get home to watch 7 sharp, I suppose, at about 7 o'clock. And Tom's not the only one getting into costume. I am playing Lord Parkwood. Okay. God, when people get home to watch 7 sharp, I suppose, at about 7 o'clock. And Tom's not the only one getting into costume. I am playing Lord Farkwood. Okay, all right. Well, Farquod me out. So if you stand up. I was quite enjoying the kind of feeling like Cinderella getting dressed for the ball. I just got people addressing me. The legs fit. Yeah. Okay, so now you get to go down onto the knees. Yeah, okay, right. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh right. Okay, see I could be in this chorus line. Yeah, arms in. Arms in. We're just going to pretend it's doing up at the back? Yes, let's pretend it's stilling up at the back. Looking good. These tiny hands are creeping me out. So there's a bit where he finally meets Princess Fiona. Uh-huh. And he wants to propose. Uh-huh. But he has to get down on one knee to do that. How long do you get down on one knee? So how are your lungers? You've been lunging this morning? Yeah, daily. I'm getting here. Here we go. Come on, Parkwood. And you've got to look up at Fiona. Here we go. And you have to say, I ask for your hand in marriage. I ask for your hand in marriage. Double the speed. There you go. What role are you in the production? I am playing the donkey. That's me, yes. We've met your girlfriend, the dragon. Yes, Delala. She's my girl. I like her. She, I like big girls. While she is a big girl, she takes six people to control her. She does. You know it takes six people to move Jeremy Wells as well. I didn't know that, but I want you. He's not a real man. He's a giant puppet. That makes so much sense now. We want you to come and see it. See, I'm not an actor, Ben. I can't do the mouth. I just do her buff. Shrek will make an appearance in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. And I'm sorry to say, Extra Lord Farquod, not included. I'm not the good. And the time I believe I could be heard if I try. Wait, stop the show. Who does this guy think he is? This is my row. Get off my high horse. It's not the first time he's tried to steal the show. We'll be back in just a moment. Thank you. time he's tried to steal the show. Wednesday sorted. Time flows like a river. And it seems as if each of us is carried relentlessly along by time's current. But time is like a river in another way. It flows at different speeds in different places. And that is the key that's traveling into the future. Right now, style is on sale at Hunter Home.

So this should be a piece of cake. Just so one word. I don't know what you're doing. Oh my gosh. You're making you mangrove. Give us a clue. Next on one and on TV and Z-plus. I tasted it and it was just a bit bland. Fine, man. Welcome back. On the show tomorrow, I finally reveal what I was up to in New York last week. I was paying a visit to the one and only Billy Joel at his house for a one-on-one exclusive interview. He spills the beans on 50 years in the music business, including the songs that he was never really that king on. There's some songs I wrote 20s really stink. Like what? Tell her about it. Tell her about it. I ate that song. I can't believe how honest you are. He doesn't like that song. It's an absolute classic. I know, and he spills the beans on other songs, too. You wait tomorrow night. I'll look forward to that. Those are our people today. That was 7 Sharp tonight. Give us a clue as up next. We will see you tomorrow. Pormarie. Cheerio."}
