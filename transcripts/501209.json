It's tucked away and just does its thing. But with our annual statements due out soon and a high chance they've taken a dip, you might find yourself wondering what to do. When it comes to our Kiwi saver, generally speaking, it's been a pretty smooth ride. Aside from a wee dip with the pandemic in 2020, there's been no real cause for concern. But for the first time in 13 years, that could change. And your annual statement might not be as rad with some losses. So do you stay on board and ride the wave, or do you bail? A retirement commissioner Jane Wrightson is here now. Thank you so much for your time tonight, Jane. Absolutely, my pleasure, Hillary. But good to see you both. Now, what is the main message for people here? It's a leaf out of the hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy Book. It's absolutely about don't panic. Kiwi save is an investment fund, not a savings fund, so it is going to go up and down. And if you think of it as a little roller coaster, you really don't want to get off at the top of the disruption, do you? You want to stay put. And what if people do need to access their Kiwi Saver in the near future? Yeah, that's the only time it really matters when you need the money early, or you're planning on buying a house, or you're close to retirement. You should have a look at it, but it may well be better just to tough it out. If you really think you need to withdraw your funds or change your fund, we always recommend going to a registered financial advisor. They're paid to look after your interest. You pay them to look after your interest. And independent advice is something that New Zealanders aren't very good at in this space. They're paid to look after your interest. You pay them to look after your interest. And independent advice is something that New Zealanders aren't very good at in this space. We pay for our doctors and dentists for our body. We pay for our plumbers and builders for our house. But there's a bit of a reluctance to pay for advice for what is a really important part of our life, which is our savings. Is there any positive news that we can hang on to? savings. Is there any positive news that we can hang on to? That the market always does get right and go up again. That's the positive news. And if you think about the contributions you make to KiwiSaver, they're buying units. And so the price of that unit you bought at the top was a lot more expensive than the price of the unit you're buying now as the dips are happening. It's called dollar cost averaging. So over time, you can take advantage of these dips because you're buying more for your money in effect. And Jane, how often should people check their balances and review their Kiwi Sabre? It's a long-term game this. So generally speaking, I would say every year, every year have a, I would say every year. Every year have a look at it. Every year think about whether the fund and the provider is the right one for you. Again, sorted can help you with this. Think about the investment strategy that your Kiwi fund provider is using. You might be a bit more interested in ethical investment these days or something else. Just have a look at it once a year. You can compare the fund performance using the tool on the sorted website, and then you can decide whether or not you want to change. But largely speaking, leaving it alone is good, as long as you conclude that the fund you're in is the right one. For instance, if you're really young and you've got 35 years of savings left, you shouldn't be in the conservative or defensive fund. You should be in a growth fund. If you're getting, you know, towards my age and stage, you're thinking much more about how much of it's balanced and how much cash you actually might need. Great advice. Thanks so much, Jane. Always good to talk to you. All good. ASB and 7 Sharp, keeping you one step ahead. The problem with the internet is it's so easy to look at it more than once a year. And when you know things are going bad, the temptation is to have a little peak. And it is quite depressing. As you see it, go... Yeah, certainly at the moment. Just once a year on your birthday. On your birthday? On your birthday. Not on your birthday. It may not be happy news. Never on your birthday. Now your birthday? On your birthday? Not on your birthday. It may not be happy news. Never on your birthday. Now selling toys is a serious business because those little moving parts can pose a hazard to babies and young children. Keeping an eye on the risk is the Commerce Commission which is carrying out unannounced retail visits looking for unsafe toys that might breach product safety standards. Babies. They're curious and they naturally explore toys by putting them in their mouth. But children under the age of three aren't good at coughing up anything they swallow by accident. So how can we reduce the risk of our tamarehi choking on a toy? Well, firstly, toys shouldn't have any small parts that break off easily, like these knockoffs that were not licensed by the brand. And if a toy or part of a toy can fit completely inside this cylinder, it's a choking hazard. But how big a problem is it? In Commerce Commission Product Safety Manager Grant McIntosh is here now. Good to see you, Grant. You've been carrying out some random retail visits to check on toy safety. What have you seen? Yeah, it's been really good. We've been out and about and checked out some businesses, had to look at some of the products they've got. And I have to say, for the most part, everything we've seen has been good, which is really reassuring that businesses are taking their compliance obligations seriously. There are a few products that we've come across that we've got a few questions about, and so we've purchased those and we'll go and get those tested and see what comes up. And what happens when you do find those toys that don't meet safety standards? What's the process? Yeah, well, the first step of the process is to send them away for testing, and as you know, toys in particular for children under three, which is what the standard applies to. Take a bit of a hammering from kids and so the standards is designed to replicate that. There's some pool tests, drop tests and twist tests. And if there are any small parts that come free in that process that could present a choking risk, then we're likely to have a failure. And so in that situation, our first priority is to make sure that the product is removed from the shelf, and so we'll engage with everything the supply chain and try and engage with a recall on those products. Thereafter, we'll look to investigate what went wrong and take appropriate action when necessary. Ingram, what sort of toys have breached product safety standards in the past? I've got one example here, a little small duck, and we've got a few issues with that. Firstly, it's too small itself and can fit in a template that it shouldn't do. And secondly, they've got a squeaker underneath that will come out quite easily and again present a choking risk for kids. Other typical issues are battery compartments that are not secure and parts that fall off when they're broken. And what should we all look out for when we're buying toys? Yeah, so consumers should have the confidence to go and buy toys that are safe. And so the obligation really is on businesses to ensure compliance. There are a few things that consumers can look out for when they're buying toys for their children, particularly for children under three. We'd encourage them to look and make sure that the toys age appropriate and so there are no small parts included in the toy that might present a choking risk. And secondly, make sure that the toy is robust and it's not broken. There's no small parts falling off it again to make sure that your children are safe. And what obligations do businesses have when they're selling toys? Yeah, as I said, the obligation really is on businesses to ensure that the products that they supply are safe and compliant. We have some really good information on the Commerce Commission website, which they can go to, which will explain their obligations, what they need to do to ensure their products comply. And ultimately, this is an area that's about protecting the vulnerable people and our Tamariki, and the risk's not worth taking in this sense. So it's really important to ensure that products are compliant. Thanks very much, Grant. Great to talk to you. That's been really great. Thanks for having us. Now, we all know New Zealand's mental health statistics have a lot of improvement to be made. And so John Kerwin is trying to tackle that. His mental health program, Mighty, runs in primary schools across the country, giving young people the tools to nurture their emotional well-being. With the help of Land Rover, he's driving from Auckland to Invercargle to get Mighty in more schools, and he needs help raising money along the way. There it is. Cool. What's been going on? What'd you do at lunchtime? At Takanini's school, there's high fives and big smiles all round. money along the way. There it is. Cool. What's been going on? What'd you do at lunchtime? At Takanini's school, there's high fives and big smiles all round. And there's a mighty good reason for it. We're going to talk about using our rangatiratanga. Mighty is an evidence-based approach to teaching mental health education in our schools. We have to find a balance between what we can control and what we can't control. With one in five experiencing mental health issues before the age of 18, John Cooin wants to spark big change, starting with the smallest Kiwis. So who knows the rules? Our goal is to get into 1,200 primary schools, because that's the number of primary schools in the gym. If we do that, then we think we'll be able to turn those stats around in a generation. It works by weaving new tools in the current curriculum. Keep going. They have a chance to talk to you about what's going on their life, talk to each other, and then we can also give them skills and knowledge and attitudes that can help them in their lives. Every school have children who have lots of worries on their little shoulders, and if they come to school with these worries, then they're not ready for learning. Teaching Tamariki how to nurture their own well-being and that of those around them. What I've learnt from this program is my strengths and values and who I am as a person. So as Sir John sets off at his Land Rover, he hopes Kiwis will donate to make this mighty mental health roadie one heck of a ride. And for more on this, we're joined by Rugby Legend, Mental Health Advocate and Mighty Founder, Sir John Kirwan. Lovely to see you again, John. Tell us a bit about how mighty is changing mental health education in New Zealand. Oh, for us, it's about giving Tamariki the skills that they need to deal with what the world is throwing at them now. So for me, really, really important that we also help the teachers make this as seamless as possible. So for me, it's about making their curriculum, given the tools they need. And your goal is to get mighty into all primary schools. Why is that important to you? I think, well, I want us to have, Jeremy, I want us to have the greatest mental health stats in the world. And I think to do that, we need to educate our youngsters, right, and 1,200 primary schools in New Zealand, thereabouts. I think if we get this into all those schools, then within a generation, we will have the best mental health in the world. These young kids, they've been through so much. You know, two years of a pandemic, it's really affected their schooling. What message would you like them to take home tonight? I just want them to be able to identify their emotions. I talk about the IQ and the EQ of mental health, so understanding why you're feeling like that, but then having the tools to be able to deal with it. And then it's a bit like seatbelts back in the old days, right? How did they change people wearing seatbelts? They taught the kids to tell their parents to put on their seatbelt, and that's the same for me. I want the kids to be able to go home and start talking about mental health and their emotions and what they're going through, just like they would talk about what they did in maths, English and science. And tell us about the roadie, John. What have you got planned? Yeah, well, we just want to go through the country. It's about really spreading the word, the mighty word, but also we'd love to raise a million dollars. We're in 70 schools at the moment. We've got 300 on the waiting list. We want to get to 1,200 schools. So we just want to get out amongst the community, talk about mental health for our tamariki and also raise money on the way. Thanks, John. Always good to talk to you. Best of luck for the roadie. Thanks. I'll enjoy it. And if you'd like to see, Sir John, head to the MightyDrive.org to find out more about the public events around the country. We'll also put a link on our Facebook page and to make an instant $3 donation to an amazing cause, text Mighty M-I-T-E-Y to 2-449.
