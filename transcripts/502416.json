Paula Bennett, Hillary Barry, Tom Sainsbury. And a whole heap of celebrities. Running, got, sand. Like you've never seen them before. Is it a dog? Earthquake. Winnie the poo. It's the game that keeps everyone guessing. Bad, mad, sad. What is it? Sunsets. Give us a clue. Please welcome your host, Paula Bennett. No-mise, Heidi Mai, Eh-Hoh Ma. Thanks for tuning in to give us a clue. This is a show where some of New Zealand's most famous faces tarnish their reputations by getting way too physical in a game of charades. I'm your host, Paula Bennett, and I know, I know, it takes a lot for me to look this good. Tonight we've brought together the Avengers of Mime. Eight celebs I know are going to play for the win. Captaining Team Tahi, the host of the only news show on TV that is actually uplifting, it's Hilary Barry. She's got some of the best hikes in the country. How will she go without her voice? It's Jackie Clark. The People's Champion of Celebrity Treasure Island. It's Jess Tyson. And one of our finest actresses. You know her voice from the sarcastic commentary on The Bachelor. It's Jody Rimmer. Heading up Team Ruah. A man so polite, even I forgive him, for spelling three years taking the Mickey out of me. It's Tom Sainsbury. Housemaster's most stressed-out contestant ever. It is David Correos. Comedy legend from the naked Samoens, it's Shimpal Elisi. And he's a lover, he's a sinner, he's a sinner, he's a renegade fighter, it is Nathan King. Of course, they're not just hoping to keep their reputations in check tonight. They are also playing for charity. Hillary's team are hoping to win some money for the SPCA. And keeping with the animal theme, Tom's team are hoping to earn some cash for pet refuge. Yeah. So, Jackie, you've had an amazing career. You were here with us last season as well. Have you been practicing your charades in between time? No. I like to keep really fresh. I like to keep all my energy in store just to let loose today. And you're feeling the competition because the guys look laid back, but... I don't know. They could be hiding some sort of secret weapons, but I'm feeling very confident about this team. This team looks like, what? delicious. I think you've got a good combo there. Jess I mean you've been a beauty queen you're ready to get ugly on the floor. Oh definitely. Definitely. Yes. How's your stress levels? I worry about it David you're gonna be right. Yeah all good. I can't wait. Big D come on mate. Yeah I'll give my big D energy oh that's the one no no no I'm not I can't wait. Big D, come on, mate. Yeah, I'll give my Big D, energy. Oh, that's the one. No, no. It's going to be good, Paula. I'm excited. And any practicing of charades in your home at all to get ready for this, Jamar? I actually can't remember the last time I played charades and there's a very good reason, but I'm going to stop there. All right, well, we've got singers, we've got actors, beauty queens and comedians. I reckon it's going to be an exciting night. So let's make sure we all know the rules. I will be handing you all tonight's clues. They could be the name of a film, TV show, a book title, a song, a play, or a famous saying or quotation. If the clue giver can get their team to guess in under 60 seconds, they get three points. If they need up to 120 seconds, that's only one point. But if their team can't get it, zero points. The biggest penalty, though, is that they might hand the points over to the other team. In the final 15 seconds the floor is open and if the opposing team can guess right then it's a game changing three points for them. Oh this is just like the squid games but don't worry if you lose. I'm not planning that kind of ending. Oh well? Oh no. Next play, give us a clue. Hillary, you're picking things off as usual. Come on up and join. Okay, dokey. Are we ready, ladies? Yes. Bring it on.

Every small business operator knows that relationships are critical to success. And in this uncertain economic moment, it's more important than ever for SMEs to nurture relationships with their customers. Using a cloud-based customer relationship management system or a CRM is a really efficient way of prioritising your customers to foster a sense of connection and loyalty to your business. A CRM helps you to manage customer accounts, track individual interactions, monitor sales opportunities and keep up-to-date contact information. Many popular CRM systems now integrate with cloud-based accounting software. Best of all, using a cloud-based system means your staff can tap into the same information pool so the customer experience continues to be prioritised. With Zero, matching bank transactions is magical. Zero connects to your bank. Your data flows in automatically, and you can reconcile transactions like that. Tadda! Matchy, matchy!
