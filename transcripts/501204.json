At the Marriy, a core Corundan 10A, today on RNZ National. The government begins its shake-up of the supermarket Guiopoly, introducing a sector watchdog and a mandatory code of conduct. We'll ask the acting prime minister, how long households will have to wait Uopoli, introducing a sector watchdog and a mandatory code of conduct. We'll ask the acting prime minister how long households will have to wait for grocery prices to come down. Jacinda Adirn gets ready to meet the US president at the White House. China falls short on its bid for a big Pacific deal covering trade and security. And a New Zealand mystery involving boxing legend Muhammad Ali is finally solved. Weatherwise, it's mainly fine in the east, though there's rain or showers everywhere else with possible thunderstorms in some places. RNZ News at 6 o'clock. Good morning. I'm Nicola Wright. The Food and Grocery Council is warning it could be years before consumers see the benefits of increased supermarket competition. A watchdog and a mandatory code of conduct are being set up to bring in more competition and tackle the countdown and foodstuff's duopoly. Council Chief Executive Catherine Rich says the government's action is a step in the right direction. She thinks the problem has been a long time in the making and there's no quick fix. We are the only country in the world that has allowed our market to distill down to being a duopoly and so there are no good examples overseas to show how to deal with this problem. Catherine Rich says she's delighted the watchdog will conduct annual reviews instead of every three years as the Commerce Commission recommended. The Prime Minister is preparing to meet US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House tomorrow. It's been a difficult lead-up. Two of her senior officials have caught COVID and had to stay and isolate in San Francisco. Jacinda Adirn says Ukraine and trade will be the main topics, with the underlying context of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. It's been seven years since a New Zealand Prime Minister has had the opportunity to meet the President in the White House. Obviously, we've had the opportunity to speak several times before with President Biden, but there's nothing quite like meeting face-to-face. The logistical challenges continue. The Air Force plane that's been carrying the delegation across America broke down in Washington, but that won't affect the Prime Minister's travel home. The latest one-news Cantar public poll shows it's still neck and neck between the left-and-right party groups. Nationals holding steady on 39% of the voters, Labor slips another two points to 35%. The Greens are on 10% and act on 7. On those numbers, neither major party would be able to form a government with their traditional partners. Te party MƒÅori on 2% support could play Kingmaker in what would be a hung parliament. Nationals leader Christopher Luxon says it's too early to discuss how his party might form a government. Christchurch City Council's support package to help compensate for the stench from its damaged waste water plant as being described as a shambles. Starting yesterday, more than 3,000 of the worst affected households in Bromley were told they could get financial and well-being support. Presi cards000 of the worst affected households in Bromley were told they could get financial and well-being support. Presi cards were among the options for households collecting their $200 payment to help cover medical appointments and other costs. But resident Stephen McPake says community centres ran out of presi cards, other centres weren't open, and there was no well-being or health support offered. Taira Fizi Gisbon has had no reprieve from the rain getting another heavy downpour overnight. Met Service meteorologist Alan Bacca says some parts of the region got 50 millimetres of rain in 24 hours and in the north there was as much as 70. Mr Baca says Taranaki will bear the brunt of thunderstorms today. The inquiry into the Lin-Mall Stabbings is not expected to finalise its report until the end of August. Ahmad Sam Sadiin injured eight people in a supermarket before being shot dead by police last September. The independent police conduct authority says it is well advanced on completing the draft report into what happened. But it says a long consultation period will be needed after that, as it's very complex. The report won't be released until it's checked to ensure classified information is not revealed, so the authority can't say when it will be made public. The coroner hearing an inquest into the death of a Palmerston North Hospital mental health ward patient eight years ago says delays to the case can't be overlooked. Coroner Matthew Bates was speaking yesterday as the hearing about the death of Sean Gray began. The coroner is the third to oversee the case. While some of the delay, not all of it, some of it's been unavoidable, all of it nonetheless is regrettable. But my hope is that by reaching this point, the hearing finally, getting everyone together into the space to explore what's happened, we can find some answers to exactly what has occurred. The coroner wants to examine 43 questions during the inquest, such as staffing levels at the mental health ward and the effects of Sean Gray's medication. The Archbishop of Canterbury won't give a sermon at a service of Thanksgiving to celebrate the Queen's platinum Jubilee this week because he's tested positive for COVID-19. The Thanksgiving service at London St. Paul's Cathedral is part of four days of celebrations marking the Queen's 70 years on the throne. The Archbishop Justin Welby says he is deeply saddened to be missing the historic celebration. In sport, the Pulse have overtaken the Mystics at the top of the ANZ Netball Premiership with a 51-43 victory over the tactics in Christchurch. The Pulse now topped the standings level on 31 points with the Mystics but a head on goal difference. Victory over the Mystics on Friday will secure the minor premiership for the Pulse and guarantee them a home grand final. The black caps have confirmed a 15-player squad to face England in the upcoming three-test cricket series with Michael Bracewell named as injury cover for the first test starting at Lords in London on Thursday. Henry Nichols is in doubt with a calf injury. Trent Bolt is also unlikely to be available for the first test, having arrived in London only yesterday. Hamish Rutherford, Jacob Duffy, Blair Tickner and Rachin Ravendra have been released from the initial squad.

And this is Morning Report with Susie Ferguson and Corrin Dam. We'll start with supermarkets, and an Auckland-based online supermarket thinks the government's changes to the industry will only give foodstuffs in Woolworth's more power. The government's clamped down on supermarkets will include a new industry regulator, compulsory unit prices and a mandatory code of conduct. Supi delivers to more than 20,000 people across Auckland, Tamaki Makoto. It's founder Sarah Ball joins us now. Good morning, Sarah. Good morning. So just remind people your business model how that works. You have some concerns about what the government's doing, in particular around the wholesaling. Yeah, that's right. So Sophie is an online-only supermarket. We don't have expensive large bricks and mortar stores with big carpets and car parts and big corporate head offices. We have a really efficient model where we supply direct from our 300 suppliers and then deliver to consumers' doors. So it's a super efficient model cutting out as much cost as possible so that we can charge consumers of fair price. And I guess your question around our concerns around wholesale supply, the government has put in place a regulatory backstop on wholesale supply, and we do think that this is giving the duopoly more power. So that means that in theory all food should be supplied through them in their supply chains. We have to remember that the Jooply is a business. So when we talk about wholesale supply, we're saying that they're selling to other retailers, effectively under the sales channel that will return a profit to the job plea and that they become the middleman for food supply, whether if you're a consumer or a retailer. The price is obviously critical there, though, isn't it? I mean, the price at which they sell to the other retailers, would that have to be regulated? The government hasn't said anything about how those prices will be regulated at the stage they've just said at a fair price. But we know that the dual-up plan will no doubt need to cover their costs to develop out the wholesale supply business and then add a margin to be able to provide a return on their cost of capital before selling to other retailers. And then we know other retailers then need to cover their costs of doing business as well as making a margin. And that is what results from the price that gets charged to consumers. I can kind of see your perspective because you've gone from Ground Zero, haven't you, to try and build your own sort of wholesale network in a sense. I mean, would you buy from the major supermarkets if they were an independent or a new sort of wholesaler that was an operation? It's highly unlikely, given that we are nervous around how they've treated supplies in the past and we know that the mandatory code of conduct will be addressing that but we've built up really positive and fair relationships with our suppliers and are doing some incredible work with them in terms of making food more affordable for Kiwis, protecting food supply in New Zealand and food production in New Zealand as well as creating an innovation hub for Kiwi food producers. So we're doing a whole bunch of work to ensure that we're protecting our food system in New Zealand and really creating a new way that we buy into our food in New Zealand. I understand. What if it was a truly independent wholesaler that was carved off in a sense? Absolutely, and that's what we've been very vocal about is that it needs to be independent wholesale supplying and really providing an alternative to the duopoly as opposed to what the government announced yesterday, which is providing them more power. We really need to carve it off and make it as independent as possible so that we truly have an alternative in New Zealand outside of the door. Just as a matter of interest, how would you do that, though? You couldn't just take assets off those companies, surely? No, and it wouldn't require to carve off any assets from our perspective in terms of providing wholesale supply. So, we've already managed to develop relationships with supplies. We have more than 300 supplies who are now providing us more than 6,000 individual products. So it is possible, and the supply chain needs to be built out anyways, but duopoly don't have the supply chain to be able to provide to 5,000 individual retailers at this point. So they're having to do the work regardless. We're just effectively, we're saying that the duoply need to pay to build this infrastructure out. They're the ones that have the deepest pockets and are able to do that. But the government definitely has the opportunity now to provide an incentive for a new wholesaler to be able to come in and actually break up the market. Just finally, there are some of the Act might have suggested this that are worried that this will in fact fact, scare competition away when you get governments regulating at any market. That is a risk, is it not? It is a risk, but it's also an opportunity, right? And that depends on what type of regulation is going to occur. I don't think the regulation that has been announced yesterday will incentivise any new retailers to come in, especially those major retailers that we're looking at who will actually invest in the market, because effectively we're saying that we're just going to give more power to the duopoly, more supply will go through them, and that's how the food system will work in New Zealand. And it's not great outcomes for New Zealand. We really need to look at how we want the food system will work in New Zealand. And it's not great outcomes for New Zealand. We really need to look at how we want the food system in New Zealand to work in the next 10 years or 20 years, and we shouldn't be relying on a duopoly to enable that. Interesting staff. Thank you very much for that. That was Sarah Ball, who is the founder of Supi, which is an Auckland-based online supermarket. It is 14 minutes past six. China has fallen short in its ambitious bid to sign up 10 Pacific nations to a wide-ranging trade and security deal. The country's foreign minister has met with his Pacific counterparts in a top-level summit in the Fijian capital of Suva. But in the end, China's had to shelve the pact, having failed to secure the support it needed. The ABC's Stephen Jedgetz reports from Suva. Talk loudly and carry a big stick. Wang Yi's carving a path through the Pacific on his eight-nation tour determined to cement China's commercial security and strategic ties, while also assuring the West it has nothing to fear. My advice to these people is don't be too anxious and don't be too nervous. Today he sat down for a virtual meeting with 10 Pacific Island foreign ministers. On the table, a sweeping regional agreement first leaked last week, which would tie China and the Pacific together across trade, development, policing and cyber security. The common development and prosperity of China and developing countries will only mean greater harmony, greater progress and greater justice across the whole world. But the proposed agreement is contentious with Pacific leaders warning the region could be sucked into a new cold war. We are concerned about the potential extent to which the nature of those agreements could extend across the whole of the Pacific. And after today's meeting, Fiji's Prime Minister delicately hinted the agreement has been put aside, at least for now. As always, we put consensus first among our countries throughout any discussion on new regional agreements. China's ambassador confirming after his foreign minister left the room that it had been shelved, while Beijing tries to convince the doubters. Of course, there are some concerns on some specific issues, and we have agreed that these two documents we will be discussed in the afterwards. Strategic jousting is unavoidable in the current era, with Western powers trying to compete against an increasingly authoritarian and ambitious China. Pacific Island countries are happy to leverage that when they can, but they're also urging the bigger players not to forget about the most existential threats. We all know plenty of eyes have been on super during this visit. I hope we also know that geopolitical point scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas. And that will require cooperation, not just competition. 17 minutes past six now, the women's world number one tennis player hasn't had an easy ride into the French Open quarterfinals. With the Polish star Iga Shwietek being taken to three sets by the unseeded Chin Wen Zheng of China. The final men's quarterfinal pairing will also be decided this morning, with Croatia's Marin Tchilich and the second-seed Russian Daniel Medvedev facing off later this hour. With us now, tennis correspondent Dave Lani. Kura, Dave. Good morning to you. Now let's take a look, I guess, first of all, at the women's side of things. Shwatech really being given quite a ride. She is. She's playing the Chinese gun. You pronounced her perfectly much better than me, Quintueng, and Shkiettec actually leads now in the final set by four games to two. It's 30 all. Shkiettec is aiming to the Polish world number one, is aiming to win her 32nd straight successive match. She's won four titles this year, one after the other. Qatar, Indian, Wales, Miami, Stuttgart, and Rome. And therefore, you just think she's going to come through on this one. A little disappointing for the Chinese player who's ranked around about the 74 in the world is that she pulled a big thigh muscle. And Sveatek, having lost the first set in a tie break, having led in the tie break, but lost it, then race through the second six-love, leads four-two in the final set. And with the Zheng serving now, she is Sviettec, a point away from taking a five-two lead. So I suppose what will then that make the quarter finals look like on the women's side of the draw? It would then be Shvietek, who is now, you would think, the overwhelming favourite, to play Jessica Picula. It is a really weird women's draw because all the favourites have dropped out. Shviatec, in fact, is the only play in the world's top 10, the world number one, that has got through, if she does get through to the quarterfinals. She'll play Jessica Pigouliu's World Rank 11 from the United States. Then there will be a couple of clashes between the Russians Kudamatova and Darya Kazat Kina. And in the other half of the draw, an all-American quarterfinal between the well-known Cocoa Goff is only 18 years of age. She'll play Sloan Stevens, the U.S. Open, former U.S. Open champion. And in the other quarter-final, where I think Lela Fernandez, who lost in the U.S. Open final last year to Britain's, Emma Reduccoigne, the Canadian, 18 years of age. She is now 19 years of age, ranked 18. She'll say Martina Trevizan of Italy. You think Fernandez, Stevens in one half of the draw, and the Shviatic wins through, now leads by five games to Tushfiatik serving for the match. You think Shviatic will come through to the final as well. Let's take a quick look at what is going on in the men's side of things. Marin Chilich and Daniel Medvedev, this would you'd think would be a pretty hotly anticipated match. It would be. That's the last 16 match to be played. That's going to be played in a little while from now. I would think, though, Daniel Medvedev is going to cruise through this one. In fact, in a most lock-sided draw, Maran Chilich is now 33 years of age. Medvedev 26, the world number two. Chilich World Rank 23 from Croatia. The U.S. Open champion, eight years ago, you just think Medvedev will come through that one and play Rublev, another Russian, in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in that half of the draw is Caspar Rude of Norway's 23 years of ages come through knocked out of Hubert Kerkatch of Poland. He is the first Norwegian to get through to the quarterfinals of the French Open in years. And he will play the surprise package, Huiga Runa of Denmark, the first day to get through to the quarterfinals of the French Open since 1925. And earlier today, he knocked out Stefano Sici Pass in pretty comfortably in straight sets and when you compare that to the top half of the draw which involves Djokovic Nadal which will take place tomorrow and then Zverev the world number three against the Wonder Kid Carlos Alcarez of Spain you can see where the drawer is so absolutely lopsided and you just think, Nadal, who remember, has won this title 13 times, just came through against Felix Alger, Ali Assim of Canada, 6'3 in the final set last night, to play Djokovic again. They've played 58 times. Jokovic leads 3028. Jokovic beat Nadal last year in the semifiles. You just think, wow, that's going to be close. The money, though, is on Jokovic. And then the other half of the draw, you think this 19-year-old kid from Al-Kuris is going to take over the mantle from Nadal. You just think he's going to beat Zveriv and get to perhaps the final. We shall watch with anticipation. It's certainly shaping up to be an interesting tournament. Dave Luddie, thank you very much. Tennis correspondent there at 22 minutes past six. A little bit of traffic news coming in. State Highway 2, Matata, a serious crash, has closed State Highway 2 between Pacific Coast Highway and State Highway 34 in Matata. Please delay your journey and take alternative routes. Now, at 22 minutes past six, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Our main story is this morning, If Iaki Nay. The government begins its shake-up of the supermarket duopoly, but consumers are asking, will it work, to bring down prices. Prime Minister, Jacinda Adirn, gets ready to meet the US President at the White House, and China falls short on its bid for a big Pacific deal covering trade and security. And at 23 minutes past six, that is time for a business update now with Giles Beckford. Good morning, Giles. Kia to you, Karen. Well, the market's still closed for the long weekend, are they? Wall Street closed for the Memorial Day weekend. European markets, though, they've touched their highest level in almost a month. Optimism has been lifted with China's easing of COVID-19 restrictions for Shanghai and also adding some new stimulus. In Shanghai in particular, authorities are looking to start reopening tomorrow and that will perhaps get some of the business are flowing again. So the pan-European stock 600, which is a broad index covering European markets, up about two-thirds of a percent. London was a bit more muted, just up a quarter of a percent. German and other European markets, about three quarters of a percent higher. Interestingly, news of China moving to reopen Shanghai gave the biggest boost to luxury good companies such as Louis Vuitton, who apparently do quite good business there. Our own top 50 index started the week up three quarters of a percent, about 80 points, 11,146, and the New Zealand dollar, 65.6 U.S. cents, 91.1 Australian. Now, no surprise is your main bulletin. You'll look at the supermarket issue and some debt. Indeed, having some differing views there as to whether it will bring real competition and lower prices. The Productivity Commission has made a few suggestions to the government on how it might improve immigration and with it lift our various fortunes for the economy. And a big glass manufacturer says, expect higher prices for building products such as double-glazed windows and the like. That, of course course and will bring you what's new on financial markets at around 10 to 7 it's a tough road in the building industry at the moment isn't it? Thank you very much Giles Beckford for that market update 25 minutes past 6 N'A Gora Tafanoa the rural news with Kim Moody now in Ototahy Kiora Kim Kiyo good morning Now capacity at the meat works has improved, but concerns that could change in coming weeks. Yeah, there's been a backlog for months now due to staffing shortages, as workers isolate with COVID-19. Those backlogs have made it harder for farmers to offload stock, which has caused huge stress, especially in areas where feed levels are tight. But in an update provided to farmers by beef and lamb and the Meat Industry Association, they say staff levels are returning to normal. Association spokesman Richard McCall says there's still a bit of a backlog of between four and six weeks for beef cattle, but there's not as much pressure on the lamb cull. There isn't currently any pressure on processes to get animals killed at the moment. That said, we're still one and a half million lambs behind year on year. So there's still plenty of lambs to go, but it appears at the moment farmers are looking to hold onto them, take advantage of putting weight on, etc., particularly those with feed available. Richard McCall says things could become tighter in the coming weeks as bobby calves come into the mix. We're probably three to four weeks out from the peak of bollah start of bobby calf season. We've stored lots of lambs out there to kill and normally we would see a decrease in lamb numbers as the bobby calf season increases or bobby calf numbers increase. So that does give us a little bit cause for concern, that we could be heading for a bit of a crunch point when bobby cap numbers pick up and as you're aware, bobby calf is a fairly short, sharp season, so the numbers come on reasonably quickly. He says farmers should keep in touch with their processes about delays. Mr McCall says supply chain issues are causing problems with storage space. He says frozen meat stores around the country are full as ships are not coming to collect product. We could certainly use some more ships, but we're just sort of keeping a head above water at the moment. But we wouldn't need a lot to change that situation. Richard McColles says the industry and the Ministry for Primary Industries is closely monitoring the situation. Richard McColles says the industry and the Ministry for Primary Industries is closely monitoring the situation. Now, also Kim, some New Zealand olive oils have won gold at a prestigious international competition. That's right. More than 1,200 olive oils from 28 countries were submitted to the New York International Olive Oil competition this year, and New Zealand growers won five medals. Wided up a loop line olives won two golds, Blue Earth from Martimbra, and Torzada Tano from Kapiti, both got one gold, Kapiti olives and Dali olives both bagged as silver. Olive's New Zealand executive officer, Gail Sheridan, says New Zealand punches above its weight when it comes to producing good oils, so its great companies are being rewarded for their hard work. Well, there's probably a couple of factors that make our oil so good. One is the fact that we do have this maritime climate and a different environment from other traditional olive-grine countries. So it's very much like the wine industry. We're producing very distinctive and complex tasting oils. And then the other thing is that, yes, we do have different growing practices here in New Zealand because of the fact of the climate. And there has been a focus on improving not only production, but also improving the quality of the oil by taking account of growth practices and harvesting and in processing as well. And Gail Sheridan says New Zealand has always been successful at the awards, which is great advertising for the industry here. That's the rural news for this morning. Thank you very much, Kim Moody. It's 29 minutes past six. You're listening to RNZ National's Morning Report with Corindan and Susie Ferguson. Huaredere today, mainly fine for the east of the Mottu. Rain or showers everywhere else and possible thunderstorms in some places too. Temperature-wise, it's pretty warm, I think. Auckland and Taranga 20 degrees, Hamilton 19. Wellington's 17, but Christchurch 20, and Dunedin also 19 degrees. The warmest place at the moment, Castle Point, in Wairapa, 17.5 degrees, the coldest place is, or marama, 2.3. I'm guessing it's a bit windy, though, at Castle Point. It's always windy at Castle Point. Now, coming up before 7 on Morning Report, the government begins its shake-up of the supermarket duopoly, but will it work to bring down prices? We're going to speak to the country's third largest grocery group. That's night and day about the changes. And Hawke's Bay Health Services are facing staff shortages due to COVID, flu, and norovirus. Now the news with Nicola Wright. The Act Party is criticising the government's plan to bring down grocery prices, arguing it will have little impact. Labor has pledged to bust up the supermarket duopoly through a suite of changes, including a mandatory code of conduct and industry watchdog. Act's leader David Seymour says the increased regulation will scare off competition, not increase it. What we need to do is ask ourselves, where are the barriers to large, sophisticated foreign operators enter in the New Zealand market? How can we remove those and get genuine competition from the top to the bottom, rather than trying to divide up the current jawular? The government's also threatened to force foodstuffs and countdown to open up their wholesale arms to would-be competitors. The Prime Minister is preparing to meet thestuffs and countdown to open up their wholesale arms to would-be competitors. The Prime Minister is preparing to meet the US President and Vice President tomorrow. Dominating Jacinda Ardern's talks with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be Ukraine and trade, with the underlying context of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. The last White House visit for a New Zealand Prime Minister was John Key seven years ago. And Joe Biden has appealed to what he calls rational Republicans to join him in taking steps to prevent more mass shootings. He says there is no rationale for wide access to high-caliber weapons. The President was speaking after meeting families of the 19 children and two teachers killed at a Texas school last week. The Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said repeatedly he does not view gun restrictions as the solution and has focused on the role of mental health. The launch of Christchurch City Council support package for residents suffering most from the stench from its damaged wastewater plant is being described as a shambles. As of yesterday, more than 3,000 households in Bromley were entitled to well-being support and a $200 payment to help cover medical appointments and other costs. But a resident says community centres ran out of the $200-Presi cards and there was no well-being or health support offered. Christchurch City Council says it didn't expect so many people to choose the card option and more have been ordered. There are fresh calls for the establishment of an Iwi bank to finance building on MƒÅori land. Tepati MƒÅori Koli RƒÅori Waititi says under the current banking systems MƒÅori don't have sufficient access to finance to build on their ancestral Fenua. The chair of the National MƒÅori Authority, Matthew Tukaki, has been a long-time supporter of an Iwi bank and suggests a cooperative bank model would work well. There were reports of gunshots outside a bar in the Christchurch suburb of Parklands last night. The police say there was a fight outside the turf bar, about half-past nine. There were no injuries, and the police are investigating. France says there was industrial scale ticket fraud at the Champions League final in Paris on Saturday, where chaos reigned outside the Stard de France, and the police fired tear gas at Liverpool fans. Its sports ministry has met with European football governing body UEFA as well as police, stadium officials and the French Football Association. Afterwards, the French sports minister Amelie Udea Castera claimed many of the problems were caused by thousands of fans with fake tickets. The root cause of all that was the volume of false tickets or persons without any tickets. The root cause of all that was the volume of false tickets or persons without any tickets. This is clearly something that we need to understand. This is why we have asked the UEFA to really dig into that. The UK government is calling for a full investigation and many Liverpool fans are disputing the version of events put forward by France. That's the news. Every afternoon when you hear these horns, it's the panel. I loved my uniform. I got to be able to do a tie when I was 15. I loved my uniform. The blazer, the tie, tying it up, 15. Did you have gavers on your socks, Wallace? Yeah, the panel with me, Wallace Chapman, week to afternoons from 345 on RNZ National. MetService regional forecasts. Now the situation, a low in the Tasman Sea, moves southeastwards towards Aaltero, New Zealand. Fronts associated with the low pass over the country tonight and early tomorrow, followed by an unsettled north-westerly flow. So for Northland, getting cloudier today, rain spreads north from late afternoon, sometimes heavy, chance of squally thunderstorms, and northerlies are strong by this evening. Auckland, Coramandel Peninsula, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Rothera, fine spells, isolated morning showers, rain tonight, north-easterlies strong and exposed places this evening. Waitomal, Taumarui, Taupo and Taranaki, showers could be thundery clearing this afternoon, rain tonight, northerly strong in Taranaki this evening. Gispen and Hawks Bay mainly fine, high cloud increasing this evening, northerlies. Wai'arapa, including Tararua district, Fanganui, Manuatu, Taihape, Horaferno, Carpiti Coast and Wellington. Scattered morning showers, some heavy, thenanganui, Manawatu, Taihape, Horaferno, Karpiti Coast and Wellington. Scattered morning showers, some heavy, then find spells. Northerly winds. Nelson and Marlborough. Shows becoming isolated this morning, however, rain tonight, heavy in Nelson. Northerly's strong and exposed places from this evening. Bulla, Westland and Fjordland rain sometimes heavy with the chance of thunderstorms, easing to isolated showers this afternoon. Heavy rain returns tonight and northeasterlies get strong this evening. Canterbury, Otago and Southland are mainly fine with high cloud, but there's scattered rain for the Canterbury and Otago lakes and headwaters this morning. Northerlies. Chatham Islands, cloudy with rain from afternoon, strong northeasterlies turning light in northerly this evening. Tomorrow's outlook, the North Island, early rain may be heavy, followed by showers in western areas. South Island, our poor, rain in the western north, heavy at times with possible thunderstorms. Elsewhere, some rain from early morning and then fine with high cloud at times. And Wednesday, Rapa, at the Chatham's rain at times. It's 24 minutes to 7. You're listening to Morning Report with Corandanne and Susie Ferguson and let's catch up on things happening in the sports world. Barry guys with us. Now let's talk cricket. The black caps have named their squad for this upcoming test series against England. Who's in, who's out? Probably as you'd expect, Susie, although there are a couple of doubts for the test. Who's in, who's out? Probably as you'd expect, Susie, although there are a couple of doubts for the test. Henry Nichols, who had a leg injury before he left New Zealand. He was still selected to go over there. He's slowly overcoming that. He also had COVID when he arrived in England, so he's a little bit behind schedule, so he is in England. So he's a little bit behind schedule. So he is in doubt. And also we have Trent Bolt, who's only just arrived in London today from the Indian Premier League. He was the last New Zealander evolved in India. So they really have to see how he shapes up tomorrow before he is confirmed in the side. But Gary Stead, the coach has more or less said that both Henry Nichols and Trent Bolt are in doubt for that first test, just because one of an injury and the other, having played just 20 over's cricket, is probably not ready for test cricket just yet. So looking at the side, though, the attack is still pretty good. You've got Tim Southey, Cole Jamison, Neil Wagner and Matt Henry. So that looks pretty good. I think the issue is going to be on the batting because it's been the New Zealand winter we've played since last summer. Only a certain number of players are played in the IPL and they haven't been hugely successful there. So you need people like Williamson, William, Tom Latham to really score some runs. And of course there's no Ross Taylor there anymore because he's retired. B.J. Watling's retired and we've always expected runs from them in the middle of the order. So that does mean the likes of Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell really do need to score some runs. So a bit of pressure on them, especially after losing the last warm-up game against the county side. I was about to ask you this. So they lost a warm-up game against a county selection. Isn't that a little bit of a concern? One bad session for the black caps. I must admit that the county side did have the best morning of seam bowling, and New Zealand fell to five wickets for nine runs at one stage to actually get back to about 150 runs and that determined the whole game really so yep it does put pressure on the batting for New Zealand I don't know if it's going to affect them too much when it comes to the test. I just quickly had a look at Middlesex Play at Lords the last first class game there because apparently it's been quite a dry summer around that area, almost 800 runs were scored in the first two innings when Middlesex played a first class game there last month. So it seems there's plenty of runs at the moment, and we'll just have to hopefully see that their black caps can make most of it when it starts on Thursday night. So come Thursday night, Brandon McCollum will be on their posing bench. Yes. Well, that's all the English are interested, really. And can they turn around? Because England have won one test in 17, I think it is, and can he turn it around? And Gary Stead was quizzed about that all day today at his media session. And he very politely said that he's sure that Brendan McCullen will make a difference to the England side whether he can do it in his very first game only having been there two weeks we'll have to wait and see but again Stead said that's a lot of professionals in that England side and it doesn't take much for them to all get together and play well so I think we're in for a very even test series. Interesting stuff. Thank you very much. Barry Guy there. It's 20 minutes to seven. Well, the government has unveiled a grand plan to bring down grocery prices, but will it work? And if so, how quickly? The suite of changes comes as Labor continues to sink in the polls, seemingly hurt by the red-hot cost of living crisis. And Labor will be hoping its latest move turns around the trend. But not everyone thinks it will work. Our deputy political editor Craig Baculloch reports, beginning with this example of what competition can look like. The only trick you need to save time and money is to shop at Aldi. At little, we're big on quality. These prices, they're so low. They're the German giants. Aldi and Little discounts supermarkets dotted all over the globe. Just not here in New Zealand. Here a duopoly dominates foodstuffs and countdown, and shoppers are feeling the pinch. I just think it would be great if we had more choice. New supermarkets, I guess. People get shopper out. Something needs to be done. I think they're just rorting, rotting the public in New Zealand at the pinch. I just think it would be great if we had more choice. New supermarkets, I guess. People get shop around. Something needs to be done. I think they're just raughting the public in the zone at the moment. Something is finally being done. The government's announced a plan to bust up the status quo with a suite of changes, going even further than the Commerce Commission recommended earlier this year. The government's taken this seriously. We want them to have fairer grocery prices. The geopolit needs to change, and we're preparing the necessary legislation to do that. The action plan includes a mandatory code of conduct and a new regulator, which will review the state of competition every year. The two giants have also been told to open up their wholesale arms to would-be competitors at a fair price. And the Commerce Minister David Clark says move quick. The government is working on a law change which will force them to do so. We are not afraid to unlock the storeroom door to get a fair deal for consumers. Consumer NZ has embraced the plan, calling it a bold and necessary step, and suppliers are pleased too. The Food and Grocery Council represents those who trade with the supermarkets. Its chief executive, Catherine Rich, a former national MP, is delighted. No one thing is going to solve the problem, but if you add everything up, I think we'll move the dial and make New Zealand a place where other independent retailers can see an opportunity. But an online grocery start-up, Supi, is not convinced. Its founder, Sarah Ball, fears the move will increase compliance costs and actually drive up prices, not dampen them. I don't think they've taken the time to really understand that by giving wholesale supply regulating that via the duopoly is actually going to make the duopoly more powerful. The Act parties David Seymour is also opposed. He argues more regulation will discourage competition and says the government should focus on real barriers such as the country's strict foreign investment rules. We should be asking ourselves, what are the barriers to entry that have stopped the Eldies of the world from entering New Zealand as a marketplace? Many parts, say provinces of Canada, for example, have those operators despite having much smaller populations than New Zealand. This will make an impact for Kiwis. There's no doubt that having a competitive market has altered the landscape in Australia. We know that having bigger players come into their market has changed the landscape. All these set up shop in Australia in 2001 and has helped to drive down prices since. But it took years to build its presence more than a decade for it to become the country's third biggest player. It's also shown no interest to date in expanding across the ditch. There are moves afoot in New Zealand's market, with the US retail giant Costco set to open a single store in West Auckland later this year. But change won't happen quick. I'd like to see it happen faster, but I'd also like to make sure that it's done properly. I don't think you can make major change like that in short periods of time. The sooner the better for that kind of change is going to take a while. The government doesn't have a while, though. It is steering down an election next year, which on current polling looks to be a nail-biter. This is Labor's latest gambit to bring it down the cost of living, and the latest poll should give it plenty of motivation. Now, neither foodstuffs or Wilworths agreed to be interviewed on Morning Report of living. In the latest poll should give it plenty of motivation. Now, neither foodstuffs or Woolworths agreed to be interviewed on Morning Report or any of R&Z's programs, in fact, always welcome to come on. Now, both issued statements promising to work constructively with the government to meet its expectations. It is 16 minutes to 7. And the country's third largest grocery group says changes to the supermarket duopoly are a much needed step towards levelling. The playing field, night and day is a Dunedin-based convenience store network. Over 50 franchise stores across the country and its general manager is Matthew Lane. Kiyohara. Good morning, Susie. Your reaction then to these changes? Yeah, we're very pleased with the step the government's taken. It's more the signalling that they are pointing towards that's most encouraging. As touched on previously, it's not going to happen overnight, but it's a key step in the right direction of promoting competition in New Zealand. What do you see happening in reasonably short order that will make a difference that consumers will see? I think what it does is it allows competition to grow. It also allows that competition to provide additional value that it can't already. By accessing cheaper prices with the buying power that they have and the market share that they currently have, it allows that value to be passed on to the end consumer, not just within the majors, but also the independent retailers as well. So what's your current setup for getting product into your stores? We do have a supply chain through progressive. It's just probably not as, I guess, tight as what we'd like. And we sort of feel that when you're working with a competitor and they can cut off that supply at any given point of time, having some form of backstop there would be very advantageous of protecting the current position. But how will you know if you're being offered goods at a better price, at a lower price, and indeed is that the lowest it could be? We don't know that. And look, it's still early stages and those discussions are to be had. David Clark was very arthright in saying that he expects it being on terms that allows other competitors to compete. So that would suggest that it needs to be better than what we get at the moment. Fair enough, but I suppose in terms of transparency, will it actually be clear how much of a better deal is being provided, whether it's actually the best deal that it could be? That's hard to tell at this stage, but hopefully they have a responsibility with the supply chain they control. Hopefully they acknowledge the fact that needs to go wider than their own retail stores. Is there any way you can see this backfiring that either prices end up staying the same or even go up? I can't see how that could happen. They still have the supply chain. They still have their retail stores. It should not drive up their prices, but it should drive down their run-houses and allow other people to compete and get to a point where they're sustainable in their own right. It's just a bit difficult when there's only 10% of the market share remaining at this stage. So is it worth another player coming into the market? If you were looking in from outside, is there even the possibility of an Aldi or a leader? Absolutely, we would welcome additional players into the market, not just a third but a fourth and a fifth fifth. I think these two ways of doing that, have someone large coming from overseas, but also allowing smaller retailers to grow in New Zealand to help protect the rural areas. Thank you very much. Appreciate your time. Matthew Lane, they are from night and day at 12 minutes to seven. Hawks Bay Health Services are facing critical staff shortages due to a trifecta of illnesses with COVID flu and norovirus, as well as a stretched emergency department at the region's hospital in Hastings. The 24-7 Medical Centre in Napier has been closed due to staff illness with us now as Hawkes Bay. Hawkes Bay's DHB Chief Medical Officer Robin Wyman. Hiora. Good morning. This sounds pretty serious. How bad are they staff shortages? We are coping with the staff shortages, but we're undoubtedly affected by them. As you said, the city medical facility had to close yesterday for some of the day due to staff shortages. We had record numbers of presentations through our emergency department yesterday. So what are that? Is it COVID and flu is the real problem here at the same time? COVID. We have flu patients presenting as well with some admissions to hospital. We have had norovirus within the hospital that has actually not affecting us right at the moment in terms of close downs, although it is still in the community. And we have the normal winter illnesses and medical presentations which also create load on the system. So it's a combination of all of those factors, Corrin. Presumably you would have tried to model and plan for this, but this is fairly exceptional. We have modelling, and we know that we are going to reach some peaks. It's difficult with the modelling, though, to know when those peaks are likely to come along, and whether you're going to get all of the illnesses at the same time. So while we do have the modelling, and we have certainly worked through those models, you do have to work with what's in front of you at particular points in time, yes. Are there any critical services that people in the community will not be able to access because of this? Well, we had City Medical closed yesterday and Sunday night due to staff illness, but open again last evening. At this point, I don't have any information on other services affected today, but we will work through those and we will make sure publicity is out if that is going to be affecting, or people will be contacted directly if their services is affected. How much of a risk is it that you will have to close the centre again if you're staff of this unwell and could you try and bring in staff from elsewhere? It is a risk but not one I have immediately in front of me and it is operated by general medical practitioners, the city medical facility and nursing staff who are slightly separate to the district health board so they will be running their rosters in a slightly separate way but we are in close contact with them to support them we we have other services are continuing to run at this point in time but have a heavy load on them and just finally what's your advice then to people in the community if they're feeling unwell what should be the process because you presumably want them to not necessarily come in if they're not too sick? No, so people who have minor health symptoms should remain at home and speak to their GP or they can also speak to their pharmacist or health line is another option in terms of creating support. If they believe they do need medical assistance and need that in an urgent situation or emergency situation. The emergency department remains available. But it is important people isolate, get over their symptoms before they come back to work or into the community so that we minimise the spread of these viruses. Robin Wyman, thank you very much. Hawks Bay, DHB's chief medical officer this morning. They are being hit by a lot of COVID flu and they had some norovirus as well. Nine minutes to seven. A quick look at the front pages of the morning newspapers. The New Zealand Herald leading with more than 150 Ministry of Justice staff and contractors being caught snooping through court records. The paper reports it took two years before employment action was taken and no one lost their job. The Waikato Times has a story on the rugby sevens. Returning to Hamilton, the event had been cancelled for the past two years due to COVID-19, but will take place again at FMG Stadium, Waikato, in January next year. Dominion Post and the press both leading with the government's supermarket shake-up. And finally on the front page of the Otago Daily Times, new rules have been approved to enable more housing growth in Dunedin, and that could result in around 1900 new dwellings being added to the city's housing stock in the next decade. A quick look at Traffic Bay of Plenty. A serious crash is closed, State Highway 2. This is near Matata, between Pacific Coast Highway and State Highway 34, and the advice is to delay your journey or use an alternative route. It is 8 minutes to 7. It is time to get to business now with Giles Beckford. Thank you, Karan Atamaria. In the business news this morning, differing views on the government's supermarket plans. The Productivity Commission has a few ideas on immigration, and the latest from the financial markets. Well, the head of a chain of convenience stores is confident government moves against the supermarket duopoly should improve competition in the wholesale market. And government plans to introduce an industry regulator, a mandatory code of conduct, compulsory unit pricing, and other measures to improve competition in the supermarket sector. A night and day general manager Matthew Lang says smaller retailers have been paying over the top prices for wholesale products as a result of the duopoly, but he expects that to change. I'm hoping it creates a wholesale market, which traditionally wholesale sold at a lower price spend retail rather than adding a premium onto it. In the past, we've been charged 40% more for the products we're obtaining through the wholesale channel than what they retail for to consumers. Matthew Lane says he's pleased the government's willing to go further than the Commerce Commission's recommendations. But the founder of the fledgling online supermarket company, Suppy, says the government's changes will only bolster the strength of the Big Two chains and their overall operations. Sophie Balls just told Morning Report that the wholesale grocery market needs an independent operator, not a system owned by the Big Two. It needs to be independent wholesale supplying and really providing an alternative to the duopoly as opposed to what the government announced yesterday which is providing them more power we really need to carve it off and make it as independent as possible Sophie ball of soupy it has been estimated that if a third operator were to come into the market it would cost perhaps upwards of a billion dollars plus and it would need at least 100 stores in order to have some scale. The Productivity Commission wants the government to make a policy statement about how many people the country can settle. It's one of 24 recommendations made to government and the final report on New Zealand's long-term immigration settings. The report reinforces the long-term nature of productivity gain from immigration. It's also suggesting a list of skills shortages to guide training rather than being an entree for more migrants. The Commissioner, the Productivity Commissioner, Ganesana, says a policy statement will require governments to set a clear pathway on immigration. We'd want to force government to be clearer and transparent about its long-term objectives for immigration and how those immigration settings connect to their decisions around investing in absorptive capacity and the decisions around investing in workforce trading and skills development. The Commission also wants to halt to any more permanent residence visas so that people can visit, leave and still have unlimited rights to return. And among its other recommendations, is that there should be a talent visa of the sort that applies in Australia so that they can spot the best talent for the skills needed in this country. A major glass manufacturer says consumers can expect higher prices in the short to medium term for such products as double glazing. Supply chain disruption and higher costs contributed to Metro Performance Glass full year loss, but the company's debt level also increasing as it held more stock. Its chief executive Simon Manders says freight costs are showing signs of stability, but other pressures continue to mount for both Metro Glass and its competitors. We're seeing the cost of energy used to produce flat glass in many places that's spiking up, particularly out of Europe. We don't really bring much glass out of Europe, but you're seeing some of the components like soda ash that are used to make glass have been increasing. So, you know, it's really hard. And then more recently we've seen, you know, the New Zealand dollar depreciate. And Simon Manda says wage pressures are also adding to its costs. It's coming up to three minutes of seven. Let's have a look now at the financial markets. Wall Street is closed for a long weekend. European markets have touched their highest level in almost a month. There's a renewed optimism with China authorities announcing that they will start to reopen business in Shanghai from tomorrow, also looking at moves to stimulate demand and the economy there. So the Pan-European Stock 600 index, which is one that covers all the major markets in Europe. That's up about two-thirds of a percent. London's FTSE 100, a bit more subdued, just a quarter of a percent higher. German and other European markets, up around three quarters of a percent. Strong gains also through some Asian regional markets yesterday. Our own top 50 index had a solid start. It just gave up some of the gains towards the end of the day ending up three quarters of a percent, about 80 points to 11,146. New Zealand dollars, you can imagine it's a bit muted on foreign exchange markets with America being closed. Kiwi buying 65.6 U.S. 91.1 Australian, 51.8 British Pence, 0608 euro. 83.6 Japanese yen and 4.37 Chinese Yuan. Brent crude oil is up $2. That's nearly 2% to 121 US $70 a barrel. That's a two-month high. And gold is up around $2.50 at $1,855.055 an ounce. Time just to tell you that the A2 milk company is applied to the US Food and Drug Administration to supply infant formula in response to the critical shortage there. Company currently supplies US with fluid milk. A2 shares quite liked the news of that. They rose 10% yesterday. Back again around half past eightast eight with the latest all markets. A corkaw call. RNZ National. At the Mariet, Good morning, New Zealand, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Korkor and Tenei. Atomariye, cool, Susie Ferguson, Tokoengawa. It is Ratu Tuesday, May the 31st. Top stories this morning, the government starts its supermarket duopoly shake-up, introducing a sector watchdog and a mandatory code of conduct. We'll ask the acting prime minister when grocery prices will start to come down. In less than 24 hours, Jacinda Ardain will meet the US President Joe Biden at the White House. China leaves the Pacific without the region-wide deal it had hoped for. And a New Zealand mystery involving boxing legend Muhammad Ali is finally solved. Weather-wise, it's mainly fine in the east, though there's rain or showers everywhere else, possible thunderstorms in some places. Atamaria, good morning, RNZ News at 7. I'm Nicola Wright. The critics are questioning whether the government's plan to bring down grocery prices will work and how quickly. The suite of changes comes as rising inflation drives a cost of living crisis. Here's our deputy political editor, Craig McCulloch. The latest one-news canter poll puts Labor just out of reach of the beehive down two points and unable to cobble together the seats it needs to govern. MPs blame the slide on the current cost of living pressures, which means it's no surprise Labor has gone after the two supermarket giants. It's promised to force foodstuffs and countdown to open up their wholesale arms to would-be competitors at a fair price. The online grocery startup, Suppy, though, fears that will only empower the duopoly, and the Act Party says more regulation will discourage competition. The Food and Grocery Council is warning it could be years before consumers see the fruits of increased supermarket competition. Council Chief Executive Catherine Rich says the government has taken a step in the right direction, but that there's no quick fix to a problem that's been years in the making. The Prime Minister is preparing to meet US President Joe Biden and his Deputy Kamala Harris tomorrow. The last New Zealand Prime Minister to visit the White House was John Key eight years ago. Our political editor, Jane Patterson, is in Washington, D.C. It's been a difficult lead-up with two of her senior officials having to stay in isolate in San Francisco after testing positive. Dominating the president's talks with Jacinda Adirn will be Ukraine and trade, with the underlying context of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. It's taking place as China's foreign minister is doing an eight-country tour of the Pacific, signing up countries to various agreements, spanning security as well as trade. Ms Ardun is downplaying its significance, saying while the pace and level of engagements picked up, she's been advised its routine diplomacy from China. The governor of Ukraine's Lujansk region says Russian forces are nearing the center of Severo-Thernetsk, the easternmost city still in Ukrainian hands. Sirai Haidai says all critical infrastructure in Severo-Thanetsk has been destroyed. But Ukrainian forces are holding on for now. The BBC's Joe Inwood reports from Kiev. We're seeing huge artillery bombardments coming in, specifically focusing on the city of Severodernetsk. That is where the Russians are focusing all of their fire. But the key question is not are they taking ground, but what is it costing them to take ground? Because it seems the Ukrainians are putting up very stiff resistance, as they have done throughout this conflict, specifically in urban settings. And so if the Russians throw everything they have at taking this one last town but expend all their resources, they lose enough men and enough armor that they can't move forward, well, President Putin might be wondering if it was the price worth paying for that small city. Government ministers say they did not know about a botch up that's delayed a $40 million project to improve services for sexually abused children. RNZ last week revealed that an independent review found the project team was so inadequate that Oranga Tamariki shut it down last August. The chair of the board overseeing the National Anti-violence Strategy, Peter Hughes, says Oranga Tamariqi should have told him instead of assuring him its work was on track. The Minister for Prevention of Sexual Violence, Marama Davidson, says she was not advised at any time about what she calls an incredibly serious failing. The Taera Fizi-Gisbon region has had no reprieve from the rain, getting another heavy downpour overnight. Police reported debris on the road in Matawai and flooding on a Wairoa Road. Met Service meteorologist Alan Bucker says there may be some minor flooding and rising rivers. In the last 24 hours, locations in Gisbon have recorded more than 50 millilitres. We've got a couple that have even recorded 70, kind of around that northernmost part of Gisbon. So there's been quite a decent dumping. Alan Bucker says it'll be another sodden day for much of the country, and Tadanaki is set to bear the brunt of thunderstorms. Two medical professors say it would be a great loss to the scientific community if the New Zealand Medical Journal folds. The Medical Association, which runs it, is going into liquidation and is seeking new owners for the journal. Otago University epidemiologist Nick Wilson says the publication allows a voice for the health and science communities raising unique New Zealand issues. And GP and Professor Sue Crengles says it's crucial for covering studies about MƒÅori health and inequity, often from a MƒÅori perspective. A former Kiwi's captain has identified himself as one of two teenagers who sparred with Muhammad Ali in a famous newspaper photo from the past. The World Heavyweight Champion was on a promotional tour in 1979 when he ran into the youngsters in Auckland. A photo of them, sparring, ended up on the New Zealand Herald's front page. The former rugby league star Dean Bell has revealed the likely lads duking it out with Ali, ahim and his cousin Wayne Bell. He remembers Ali singling them out. And he was looking straight at us, straight at me in the eye. And he says, you two, I'm going to fight you. He says, oh, why, why's that? He said, oh, you've been pervin on my missus, you know, which we had, to be fair. The image will feature in the photojournalism New Zealand charity auction in September. A man disguised as an elderly woman in a wheelchair has thrown cake at the Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting at the Louvre in Paris. The piece which was undamaged was left with white cream smeared across its protective glass. The perpetrator, seen wearing a wig and lipstick, urged people to think of the earth while being led from the scene. The incident was described by witnesses as jaw-dropping. In sport, the pulse have hit the top of the A&Z Netball Premiership ladder lead from the scene. The incident was described by witnesses as jaw-dropping. In sport, the Pulse have hit the top of the A&Z Netball Premiership ladder with a 51-43 win over the tactics in Christchurch. The Pulse are ahead of the Mystics on goal difference and the minor premiership and direct entry to the grand final will be decided when the two sides meet in Auckland on Friday. The black caps will be without batter Henry Nichols and strike bowler Trent Bolt for the first test against England starting at Lords on Friday. The black caps will be without batter Henry Nichols and strike bowler Trent Bolt for the first test against England starting at Lords on Thursday. Coach Gary Stead says Bolt has only just arrived in London from the Indian Premier League final while Nichols has a car for injury and has had COVID. The COVID just put him back another week or so from where we were wanting but he is progressing really well. I think at the moment he's an unlikely starter. Stead has named a 15-player squad for the upcoming three-test series with Michael Bracewell added his cover for Nichols. And the Chelsea Football Club's $8.2 billion sale to a consortium led by American investor Ted Bowley has been completed. That's the news. On first blush, the trend is not Labor's friend, is it Craig? No, this just bakes in that trend, doesn't it? Labor would have been hoping for a bump from that budget, but it has been taking a hammering. Over what period was this taken? Well, the budget was being rolled out? It comes after the budget. Here's how you know Labor is worried. They put out an attack and today directly targeting Christopher Luxon. While the Prime Minister is still up on 33% and ahead, Christopher Luxon, in essence, is nipping at her heels. Checkpoint with me, Lisa Owen, takeaways at the end of the day on RNZ National. Now the forecast from Met Service to midnight, Northland has rained from late afternoon heavy at times, and there could be squally thunderstorms. Gisbon and Hawke's Bay, fine. The remainder of the North Island, including Wellington, scattered showers, may be thundery in the west clearing this afternoon. Rain from Taranaki to Taupo and Bay of Plenty northwards tonight. Nelson and Malbara showers becoming isolated this morning. However there's rain tonight and it's heavy in Nelson. Bola Westland and Fiordland rain sometimes heavy with the chance of thunderstorms easing to isolated showers this afternoon. Heavy rain returning tonight. Canterbury Otago and Southland mainly fine with high cloud. Chatham Islands cloudy with rain from afternoon. In the main centres, Tamaquimakarro, Auckland has showers becoming isolated this morning. Rain from evening may be heavy. Northerly, strong and exposed places this evening, 20 degrees. Tauranga partly cloudy with a chance of a morning shower. Rain tonight, northerlies from afternoon, fresh at night, 20. Kiti-Kidiroa, Hamilton, one or two showers in areas of morning fog, and then partly cloudy. Rain tonight, northerlies from afternoon, 19 degrees. Fort Tifangana, Ata, Wellington. Shows may be heavy, clearing this afternoon, then fine at times, northerly strong and exposed places, 17. And O'Totahe, Christchurch, and Dunedin, Othipote, fine and warm today with high cloud, northeasterlies. Christchurch, 20, Deneden, 19 degrees. It's nine minutes past seven. And you're listening to Morning Report with Corindann and Susie Ferguson. First today, the government's plan to shake up the supermarket duopoly has the backing of consumer groups, but will actually bring down your grocery bill. Under the changes, a grocery sector watchdog will be set up and a mandatory code of conduct will be introduced. Supermarkets will also be forced to open up their wholesale arms to would-be competitors if they haven't already done so by the end of the year. The crackdown comes as labour continues to be hurt by the rising cost of living and the acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson is with us now. Morena? So when are these changes going to drive down prices for shoppers? Yeah, well we're already seeing prices come down a little bit with the gestures that we've seen from the duopoly in response to the pressure that I think they're now feeling as a result of the market study and our follow-up to that. Clearly, this is a big sector, and so the changes will take a little bit of time to come in, but we expect that New Zealanders will be paying fairer prices into the future because we'll have a more competitive market. But when will this particular one resonate through for shoppers, do you think? the New Zealanders will be paying fairer prices into the future because we'll have a more competitive market. But when will this particular one resonate through for shoppers, do you think? Well, there's a series of initiatives here, aren't there? I mean, the big one here really is around wholesale because for any competitor coming into the market, they firstly need the land to build a supermarket. We introduced the legislation on budget night to stop those covenants, the land banking that the Geopoli was doing. With the wholesale opening up, that means they can actually have goods to put on their shelves. We've said we want that fair price arrangement. If it's not there, we'll have a regulatory backstop ready to go by the end of the year. Consultation is going out in the next few weeks on the Code of Conduct, on unit pricing. We're starting the work on the regulator being set up now. So towards the second part of this year, we're going to see legislation introduced to cover off a number of these measures. And as I say, the wholesale pricing is absolutely something we expect to be operating by the end of the year. On the wholesale pricing, how will you know that the prices being offered are fair? Well, I think obviously those who are competitors will be very clear about what they see to be fair, but that's the work that officials are doing right now. The Commerce Commission identified that supermarkets were taking about a million dollars a day in excess profits from New Zealanders. So we're very clear at the quantum of the problem here. We've just got to get a system designed that makes it fair for a new competitor to enter the market. We've already seen the likes of the warehouse put more products on the shelves. We've got interest from a number of other players. They need to know that they've got places they can build supermarkets and they have access to goods. That's what we've announced in the last week or two. What other players are interested? I'm not going to put them out there, but people have seen Costco arriving in New Zealand. There are other players in the Australian market that people can take a look at. Aldi? So there are definitely people who are interested. Is it Aldi? Well, ALDI is one of the players, but I'm not going to announce things to people today. What we're doing is making sure that the conditions are there so that not only can competitors enter the market, but New Zealanders will get fairer prices. So you think as a result of putting these changes into place, it's possible that ALDI will come here? Well, it's possible that a number of people will come here and also not just those at the big end. I mean, one of the things here is that some of the smaller players who are already in New Zealand might find themselves being more confident to expand, to be able to provide the kinds of greater access to greater range of goods. So the whole point here is to increase the amount of competition because when we look around the world, New Zealand doesn't have that and we are paying too much for our groceries. How much pushback are you likely to get from the big two on this? And indeed, could it even be that because everything will go through the duopoly on the wholesale side of things, it could even increase their power? Well, no. I think, you know, what we're hearing from the duopoly is they recognize that there is a need for change. We now need to see a follow-through on those words with actions, and that's why we've given them some time to open up the wholesale side of their business but if that doesn't happen we're going to regulate it and make sure it does. I think the outcome of this will definitely be more competition and it will lead to lower prices but we have to stay on them and you know it's clear that none of this would have happened if we hadn't done the Commerce Commission market study. New Zealanders are already seeing them react, and I think they'll see more. Because you will be wanting to see this make a difference also in the polls. Of course, one out last night, Cantor One News. Would you be expecting a budget bounce from that? Because you didn't get it. I've been on the road in New Zealand continuously, actually, since the budget came out. And it is very clear that a lot of New Zealand families are doing it tough at the moment off the back of COVID, and now we've got this big cost of living pressure driven by these global inflation trends. It is hard out there for a lot of families and households. Our job is to make sure that we look after New Zealanders, which we did through the budget with the cost of living payment and the other initiatives there and keep listening to New Zealanders about what's going on. So, you know, a budget is one moment in a political year. There are many other things that we're doing. And also, you know, not all of us, Suzy, you and me focus very closely on what's happening in politics. A lot of people are just getting on with their lives. And, you know, when they get that cost of living payment, $350 from the 1st of August, they'll feel that, and they'll be pleased to get it, I'm sure. I'm sure, but it does seem that for that money, you're not getting anything back politically. Well, that's not why we did it. We did it because we know New Zealanders are doing it tough through this period of time, and we had a big package on the 1st of April to support low- and middle-income earners, and this extends out the support to a wider group of people. Our job is to do the right thing for New Zealanders. There's an election in 18-months time. I'll worry about that then. What I'm worried about at the moment is making sure that we build off what we did through COVID. We've got a strong economy, and we can ensure that New Zealanders benefit from that over the course of the next 80 months, and then people will make the judgment then. Finally, if I can ask you about TVNZ, the presenter Kamal Santa Maria, has the government had a fulsome response from TVNZ about, indeed, the resignation and the due process that had gone on whilst that recruiting went through? So Minister Chris Farfoy, the broadcasting minister, sought an assurance that everybody in this scenario was being supported appropriately, and he received that. He then followed that up seeking an assurance around the appointment process. Obviously, the government does not get involved in the detail of individual presenters. But has that not been an easy question for TVNZ to answer? With the news and current affairs, what that question was was directed to the board, because that's the relationship we have, and we're awaiting an answer on that. I'm sure the board is undertaking its own questions and due diligence in that matter. Now, Mehi, acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson there is 16 minutes past seven. Let's get some more now on the supermarket, shake-up with us now as the chief executive of the food and grocery council, Catherine Rich. Good morning. Good morning, Karen. Well, you heard the minister there talking about ALB, ALDI, I should say. do you think, have you heard anything about them, perhaps making an entry to New Zealand? I haven't heard anything about ALDI, but I think the government's announcements certainly make it clear that New Zealand is open for business because independent retailers and other chains have often looked at New Zealand and viewed it as closed because you have in a trench duopoly and it was always seen as very difficult to get sites. One of the things the government has done, of course, is it's about to prohibit land banking and prohibit exclusivity clauses and leases. So that should free up sites up and down New Zealand. Do you believe that there's, I mean, Act was arguing that there's still barriers to investment from a big foreign supermarket chain coming in here. Do you believe that's true? That could be true. I mean, there are some issues to do with the, in terms of international investment. But I think the big changes will happen from Kiwis locally. You've already seen new buds of investment by the warehouse. You've also seen that the Americans come in and open up a Costco. Look, we've taken two decades to get into this situation where competition is very constrained. It's going to take some years to get out of this situation. But I think what the government's announced is a pragmatic start to improve in competition. Do you, two decades with a duopoly, why should we trust that the duopoly will be able to run a wholesaler for other retailers that will be offering prices that are reasonable? Well, the duopoly will say it's complex and it's hard to do and it'll take time. But in reality, they have actually been supplying some of the independent retailers previously. It's not that hard to set up an account and to supply them. The big thing will be to make sure that they are selling to the independence at a competitive price. The big gain for the independence was that for the first time they'll be able to buy aggregated supplies of groceries because what's happened for the independent retailers in the night and days and others is that due to the wholesale market being completely broken, they've had to line up at the supermarket with everybody else to buy their stock. Now, if they're doing that, they were never going to be competitive. That's why your dairy is so expensive. Why not just go that extra bit and have a fully independent wholesaler? Enable that in some way? I think that is the long-term ambition, because I believe that asking the food markets to open up their wholesale should be viewed as a short-term solution while an independent wholesaler is established. Because you don't want to do anything that entrenches the duopoly further by having that extra business. But I do think that there are discussions that are happening in New Zealand. There are some who believe it is a big opportunity. Some have put a value on it at over $2 billion in terms of an opportunity to get involved in an independent wholesaler. But who knows? There are lots of discussions happening up and down in New Zealand within the business community. What would that model, what would it look like that independent retailer if we can get there? Is it like chorus or transpower or some sort of, and would it require some government help? Or do you think that there is that private investment that might have a crack? Well, the big hurdle was finding sites because exclusivity clauses would more or less block any potential competitor. And that will be discussed at the Select Committee on Thursday. But the new entrant to watch, I believe, is the warehouse, because they've got a footprint of around 90 stores. They're going back to old-fashioned grocery promotions and offering specials to get the foot traffic in. One of the reasons I think they were involved in the Comcom process was they didn't want to repeat of 2006-2008 where the duopoly brought up their shares and applied such pressure to supplies that no one wanted to supply them. The environment has changed and I think yes there could be some newcomers coming in, could be an Audi, could be a number of different options. But at least now they know they're going to get sight, they're not going to get beaten up the way previously new entrants have been beaten up. There's an opportunity to get aggregated supplier groceries. Got to ask about suppliers. Will they not get squeezed further by this if the duopoly is under pressure and looking to obviously provide wholesale goods are the suppliers going to get squeezed here well when you still have a duopoly and you're going to have that for some years that's always a risk and it was interesting with the you know the price announcements from one of the supermarkets to lockdown prices. I'd have had reports from suppliers that they were immediately asked to drop their prices, which put supplies in a more difficult position. One of the other good things yesterday was the government affirms its support for a mandatory code of conduct. And what has occurred in the United Kingdom and Australia is that when you have a code that's brought in that makes business relationships more transparent and prohibits a lot of the more egregious behaviour, that gives suppliers a bit more of an opportunity to negotiate and stand up for themselves. So will a grocery regulator and a good disputes resolution system. Because right now if you put your head above the parapet, suppliers are worried that they would get kicked off the shelf. I don't think that's going to happen in the current environment. And just finally, code of conduct, what difference will that really make? Well, it just means that there's a referee on the field and that there are a few more rules about what suppliers can be asked to pay for. Over the last 20 years, suppliers have taken on greater risk and additional costs. The retailers have more or less shifted a large proportion of their business costs, including in some cases their wages bill, back on to suppliers. So by that I mean costs of promotions, cost of everything really. And the code of conduct will make it clear what they can and can't do and also give suppliers something to point to if they're being beaten up by a buyer in a local store. Metaphorically, I mean. Yes, indeed, indeed. Very good. Thank you very much for that. That was Catherine Rich from the Food and Grocery Council. Let us know what you think about the supermarket changes. In fact, you are doing so. Lots of feedback coming in on that issue this morning. We'll see if we can get to some of that. A bit later in the program. It is 23 minutes past seven. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardairn says not to expect any flashy announcements from her meeting with the US President Joe Biden at the White House in less than 24 hours. John Key was the last PM to stop by seven years ago. Ms Ardain says these kinds of face-to-face meetings are incredibly important. What I would say is that it's very clear that personal relationships for President Biden are important and I'd say the same, I consider myself to operate on that same principle, but that very first call, where we immediately discussed his connection to our region through his family, his visit to New Zealand. Already it was at a level where we were building those connections straight off the bat. I don't intend, tomorrow is not about announceables, It's not about new initiatives. It actually is about that relationship but I already consider it to be a strong one. While dominating Jacinda Ardern's talks will be Ukraine and trade with the underlying context of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific Ms Ardern is downplaying China's foreign minister Wang Yi's visit to the region. Actually from this latest round of engagement, what's been described to me is that it has by and large been routine diplomatic engagement. And I think we do need to just take a step back and remember that, of course, China has been present in the Pacific and active in the Pacific and across infrastructure projects and built relationships over a number of years. What is happening right now is not new. Perhaps the pace has picked up and the engagement has picked up, but it is not new. What we are, of course, encouraging is that the United States relationships, that they grow and that they equally continue to build those consistent relationships in our region, because there's no doubt the pace of engagement has increased. Well, with us now is our political editor, Jane Patterson. Jane, Kiara, good morning. What is it that we can take from that comment regarding Wang Yi's visit? Is it routine? Kiyo da Suu, well, certainly the focus on Wang Yi's multi-country trip into the Pacific, the deals that China's trying to strike with the Pacific countries, and of course that security pact with the Solomon's, none of that would suggest that this is routine diplomacy in terms of particularly the response from other countries. The backdrop to this trip is building coalitions really on both sides. China trying to boost its influence through trade, through security and other measures in the Pacific. And on the other hand, the United States through its Indo-Pacific economic framework, also trying to build coalitions of like-minded countries and with tags like the traditional values and the rule of law. So trying to draw in its allies. So rule of law. So trying to draw it in its allies. So both of these countries really trying to build on it. So I think Jacinda Adun's comments are fascinating in terms of, as I said, the focus and the concern that New Zealand itself has expressed about some of the things that are going on in the moment in the Pacific. Now, of course, that White House visit coming up very soon, the final preparations being made. What can we expect? It's going to be a meeting, obviously, with President Biden and also the Vice President Kamala Harris. It's going to be a relatively short, tight visit. There will be meeting and discussions in the Oval Office. President Biden will come out and make some comments to the New Zealand media and US media who are there. But Ms. Ardun is downplaying expectations already. She's saying, look, this is all about the relationship. Don't expect any big flashy announcements or big things coming out of it necessarily on that side. But for her, it's about not just the relationship with President Biden, but continuing to build that relationship with the US. Now, this is the first time she has met him in person. John Key was here last seven years ago. So it has been a long time. And Jacinda Redern has had several phone calls with President Biden, but all over the phone and all by Zoom, and she made the point that these face-to-face relationships, that is how you build the relationships. And we asked her before she came on the trip about being in direct contact with some of these very influential leaders, whether you could drop someone or WhatsApp message or not. And really, that's the kind of relationship that prime ministers want to be getting to that, to be able to reach out informally when things are difficult. So a lot of anticipation ahead of this visit. Any further problems here, though, because of course there have been some COVID-positive tests within the delegation anymore? Well, Susie, the logistical challenges just keep on coming. Just before I came on air, there was confirmation that there was a third person in the Prime Minister's delegation who has tested positive for COVID. Now, we all had to have PCR tests this morning ahead of that White House visit. And this person is asymptomatic and had actually been returning negative rat tests, but it takes another person out of the delegation. It's actually got to the point where this morning, Ms. Ardun was just directly organizing her stand-up with New Zealand media because her pre-secretary is back in San Francisco. But she said in terms of the official meeting and the White House tomorrow, that is all set. They have enough people, they have the people they need and the numbers that they need because, of course, they had contingency plans as well. We have been travelling on the Air Force plane around the states. We've been to several cities and it has broken down. We got the news this morning that it has broken down in Washington, D.C., so we are arranging alternative travel home, but it won't affect the Prime Minister's travel back. She was always going to travel back commercially. So, yeah, we'll just see what keeps happening. I mean, it wouldn't be an overseas trip Jane on the 757 if it didn't break down, surely. Absolutely, absolutely, Yeah, always smooth. Fantastic. Thank you very much. That is our political editor, Jane Patterson, there at 29 past seven. And coming up before 8 on Morning Report, Police Commissioner Andrew Costa is with us to talk about the ongoing gang tensions in Auckland and Northland. We'll cross to Suva, where China's foreign minister has left without the Pacific-wide deal that he had hoped for. And Bromley residents say the launch of a support package for those affected by the wastewater plant stench is a shambles. Now the headlines with Nicola Wright. The government says the plans to shake up the supermarket sector could see the arrival of new competitors, but refused to say whether Aldi was among those it hopes to lure over the Tasman. Supermarkets will be forced to open up their wholesale arms to would-be rivals if they haven't already done so by the end of the year. The acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson told Morning Report that will help operators such as the warehouse, Costco, and other players in this country and in Australia. He says it will also give smaller businesses the confidence to expand. Hawks Bay Health Services are being stretched as a combination of winter illnesses hits the region. The hospital's emergency department is seeing a record number of people turning up while simultaneously facing a critical staff shortage. Hawks Bay DHB's chief medical officer Robin Wyman told Morning report people with minor symptoms should isolate at home and contact their GP. The Chinese foreign minister's tour of the Pacific region heads to Tonga today. China's embassy in Tonga confirms Wang Yi will sign agreements including cooperation documents on disaster prevention and mitigation. Mr Wang began his Pacific tour last Thursday in Solomon Islands, where he stressed that China will develop relations with Pacific Island countries and expand cooperation. It'll be another sodden day for much of the North Island, and Taranaki is set to bear the brunt of thunderstorms today. Met Service says Taidafizi got 50 millimetres of rain in 24 hours, while northern areas were hit with as much as 70. It says the far north is set for another downpour this evening. Auckland drivers are being warned to expect delays where a car has crashed on the south-western motorway. The right northbound lane is blocked after the car crashed near the Bada Drive overbridge just before 7 o'clock. That's the news.

And you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Russian forces are carrying out artillery strikes along much of the eastern front line, which runs through Luhansk and Donetsk, and are moving to take control of the strategic city of Severdenesk. However, Ukraine says its military is having success recapturing territory in the south of the country. The BBC's Joe Inwood explains the situation. Our understanding is that we're seeing huge artillery bombardments coming in, specifically focusing on the city of Severodonetsk. That is the easterly most point that the Ukrainians still control, and it's the last big population centre in the Lohansk region, the Lohansk Oblast. That is where the Russians are focusing all of their fire. But the key question is not are they taking ground, but what is it costing them to take ground? Because it seems the Ukrainians are putting up very stiff resistance, as they have done throughout this conflict, specifically in urban settings. And so if the Russians throw everything they have at taking this one last town but expend all their resources, they lose enough men and a lot of armor that they can't move forward, well, President Putin might be wondering if it was a price worth paying for that small city. It comes as Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has started a renewed push for weapons and support from international allies. There's been a sort of a change in the rhetoric around this. At the very start of the war, there was desperation. They needed much more. Then I remember the press conference. I was there when President Zelensky says, actually, we are getting the amount of equipment we need and with the urgency required. But then in the last week or so, it's changed back. We've started to hear complaints again from Ukrainian authorities that they're not getting enough equipment. And I think that probably is indicative of the way the war is going in the east. There's specifically allegations today as well that Hungary and Germany are doing stuff acting in such a way that it holds up delivery of heavy weapons. As you say, they don't give us a running commentary, but it does sound like they are getting desperate again. Meanwhile, the withdrawal of Russian forces near Kiev is gradually revealing more evidence of war crimes. CNN's Melissa Bell has this report. more evidence of war crimes. CNN's Melissa Bell has this report. Russian tanks entering the village of Lepivka in late February. Now in charge here, of life and of death. Six weeks later, now back in control of the village, Ukrainian authorities begin counting the dead. I can't look, says one mother. It was only after the tanks had withdrawn that Ukrainian prosecutors were able to start piecing together what had happened. They now suspect these men of crimes in violation of the rules and customs of war. On this street, nine soldiers of the 64th Brigade imprisoned unarmed civilians. They detained and tortured them for 10 days, inflicting bodily harm, and carried out mock executions. We wanted to see for ourselves where some of these alleged crimes might have been committed. Going door to door with pictures of the soldiers, we meet Andri, who recognizes one of them. Is it locked? He leads us down to a cellar, where he says Russian soldiers tried to kill a group of men and women who'd been hiding. They used grenades and rifles, he says, but the civilians managed to survive by heading further into the darkness. This is the scene of just one of the alleged crimes of the men of the 64th Brigade. It is littered with cigarettes and bullet casings. Back in L'ipivka, we show Mikhailaznak, a local resident, a picture of Commander Vasil Lidvenenko. He recognizes him immediately and invites us into what's left of his home. He and his family hid in the woods, he says, while his home was destroyed by the Russian artillery that killed his neighbor. When he tried to come back, he says the commander seemed surprised. He said, what are you doing here? You should have been burnt alive. Mikala still doesn't know why he decided to let him live. Raping of people, torturing of people, for what? Because they wanted scare civilians, scare our citizens of towns, villages, cities. After withdrawing from the Butcher area, the brigade's men were promoted by Moscow. The Kremlin denies any involvement in the mass killings. The 64th brigade was created after the Georgian war, according to Ukrainian intelligence. The soldiers of this brigade, he says, were noted for their robberies and rapes. But instead of bringing order to the brigade, the Russian command armed it, he explains, with modern weapons, and sent it into Ukraine. Beyond working out exactly what the Russian soldiers who occupied this area north of Kiev might have been responsible for, the big question for Ukrainian prosecutors now is where they are. And that was the Siennes. Melissa Bell, with that report, it is 21 minutes to wait. China has fallen short on its bid for a big Pacific deal covering trade and security. Foreign Minister Wang Yi had been hoping to get 10 island nations to sign up for a broad deal, but Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama says the Pacific nations are putting consensus first. Geopolitical point scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is sleeping beneath the rising seas, whose job has been lost to a pandemic. The tour has also been described as stoking geopolitical tensions and threatening regional stability. Let's go to our correspondent in Suva Liseisei Mavono, who's with us now. Bolovenaka, Kiora, how are you? Morena, any unred to you, Susie? I'm well, thank you. A little rettled, but rested, thank you. Rettled, yes. I think we'll talk about that, actually, in a moment, Lisei. But firstly, take us to this meeting between Frank Bainimara and Wang Yi. What was said in that press conference? Well, they basically said, you know, that they have a good relationship, that they have the same vision in terms of international diplomacy and international relations. And there was a lot of swiping at Australia, America, maybe New Zealand to an extent by the Chinese, when they continued to assert that it is, they respect Fiji's sovereignty, they respect the Pacifics need to be, you know, powerful on its own, that though small the Pacific was important and that China understood that kind of importance. And there was a lot of what looked like criticism of the way other countries who work with the Pacific Islands, and in particular Fiji, conducted themselves in the relationship. And there was also explanation as to what took place in the two meetings that happened yesterday, the first one being with the Fijian government, the second one being with what we understand are the foreign affairs ministers from the 10 Pacific Island countries who actually have relationships with Beijing. And so the state of play now, where are things likely to go? Well, it looks as if Wang Yi goes back to Beijing without the deal that he intended to have with the 10 Pacific Island countries. They did say, the ambassador to Fiji, did say that they will go back and look at the partnership again and speak with their, you know, Pacific Island counterparts. But it looks like they have shelved it for the moment because, as Bainamara said earlier in that press event yesterday, the Pacific works by consensus. So if there's no consensus, they don't move forward. We have some guesses about where it is the no might have come from in the region, but so far, very little is known about what to place at that meeting and about this entire tour, Susie. So where are, where is the smart money on in terms of the no and the reasons behind that coming? Well, well, my guess is Samoa. I'm looking to appear only because Afia me, the prime minister of Samoa, pretty much came into power on a platform of saying, I will protect Samo's sovereignty. I will re-look at the partnerships made by the previous government with China, which at the time had been looking at the similar agenda that China has with the Solomon Islands, which is a possible military presence on Samoa. And so that's one very good guess, I think. We do know that they're visiting, they're on their way to Tonga today, and then Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. I think Papua New Guinea is worth exploring as well in terms of being hesitant to enter into a deal with China. But it's very hard to know what's going on because unlike usual, where the Pacific Island countries work together under the auspices of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the forum has been left out of this particular meeting completely. So it is hard to understand. There's a lot of secrecy and there's very little transparency coming out of either the Chinese government or the Fijian government for that matter. Now, you mentioned at the beginning that you were a bit rattled with this situation. Just talk us through a little bit of some heavy-handedness that you experienced. I think, Susie, I knew from, you know, weeks before, or days before, rather, the tour began that it was going to be a difficult one for the media, given that my colleagues in Honiara, the media association of the Solomon Islands or Masi, led by its heads, Dorothy Wickham and Georgina Kekeh had announced that they would be boycotting the visit because they had received information. They wouldn't be allowed near Wang Yi, nor allowed to ask questions at the press conference. And so I guess we knew then that we were going to be dealing with an unusual situation, you know, Fiji being a democracy. However, in the week leading up, more than a week before Wangis arrival in Fiji, none of the usual protocols where the government would issue invitations, ask for names, vet people, issue credentials and things like that, had taken place. And by the middle of the week, when that still hadn't happened, we realized this was going to be difficult. So we pushed, and I have to pay credit to my colleagues overseas, the ABC, Al Jazeera, my friends there in Auckland and Wellington at the RNZ. It was pooling of information that helped us to know one very important thing, that, first of all, one, he was arriving in Fiji a whole 24 hours before he had officially indicated he would. So that information helped us to understand he would be at the forum and then there would be these other two meetings hosted by the Fijian government, one for Fiji and one co-hosted by Bina Marama and Wang Yi for the Pacific Islands. So we were shoved around, moved around, men handled by men and women by the Fijian government as well as the Chinese government I saw I had to rescue a cameraman colleague from the ABC who was blocked from entering into the Pacific Islands Forum meeting room by a visiting Chinese official who told him you are not Fijian you are ABC, go away. And myself and a younger female colleague from the Fiji Broadcasting stepped in to rescue him, pulling him by the arm and telling this woman, leave him alone, get away from him. It was very, very disturbing, I think, is the word I finally have come up with. And then being removed from the lobby of the meeting room where we had been invited by the Department of Information at Fiji to come and photograph and take footage of arrivals, you know, just arrivals, no talking. We were removed from there by Chinese officials, by the Chinese ambassador himself, and then helped along by riot police of the Fiji Police Department and police intelligence so it was very disturbing. Indeed, thank you very much for bringing us up to date with all of that. Lisei Mavono our correspondent in Suva at 13 to 8. After more than four decades, the mystery of who the two teenagers sparring with boxing legend Muhammad Ali are, and a famous New Zealand Herald photograph, has been solved. The World Heavyweight Champion was on a promotional tour in 1979. When he ran into the two youngsters on Auckland's Queen Street, one of whom it turns out also went on to have a distinguished sporting career. A Taranaki Fanganui reporter, Robin Martin, has more. The image featured on R&Z last week in a story about a Taranaki Hospice charity auction of 100 iconic examples of New Zealand photojournalism. Now rugby league legend Dean Bell has come forward and revealed the likely lads duking it out with Ali with a former Kiwi star and his cousin Wayne Bell. Dean Bell says he and Wayne, who died a few years ago, had just been to the Civic. Come out of the movie, I can't even remember what it was, and we just seen this large gathering of people on the other side of the road. And we thought, I've been inquisitive teenagers, we'll just go over and be nosy and go and have a look what's going on, who it is, what's all the fuss about. And obviously we crossed the road and we got over there and we've seen it as the man himself. Wow. To say we were in awe was an understatement. The encounter then takes a twist. After a couple of minutes this large, ballowing voice said, you two boys in front of me, I want to fight you. So we ignored him, which, you know, was probably not the right thing to do because straight away again, you two boys! And he was looking straight out, straight at me in the eye. And he says, you two, I want to fight you. Because, oh, why, why is that? He said, oh, you've been pervin on my missus, you know, which we had, to be fair. Bell says his 17-year-old self could tell the great man was joshing and soon the journalist nearby sensed an opportunity. Former Herald photographer, Jeff Dale, 17-year-old self could tell the great man was joshing and soon the journalist nearby sensed an opportunity. Former herald photographer Jeff Dale who'd been struggling to get a good shot all morning was among them. Suddenly there were a couple of young lads crossing the street and he yelled out, you want to fight. So Ali yelled at these young guys, do you want to fight? As they sort of came in, I sort of skirted around behind them so that I could see Town Hall and Ali sort of throwing punches and it made a much better picture than anything I'd shot earlier and it was just terrific. Dale also admits to being a bit starstruck by the boxer. I was able to go into his hotel in the next day with a print and he signed it for me so it's a special memory of a great boxer. Something a bit odd about that signature, though, Jeff, isn't there? Yes. Yeah, there is. He doesn't know how to spell Jeff in the English way. He's in American, so he said, what's your name, man? And I said, it's Jeff, so he wrote J-E-E-W-F instead of G-E-O-F. Dale was taken aback to learn all these years later that Dean Bell was one of the young men. Dean Bell, wow, that's amazing. I must look at the print again and it's got a whole new meaning, really, isn't it? Former New Zealand Herald Illustrations editor Rob Tucker is putting together the charity auction. Tucker sent Jeff Dell out on their Ali job in 1979. He's blown away that one of the boys who appeared on the front page with the boxer is mean Dean Bell. I think it's amazing. It's what I'd like to try and remember was Dean Bell a dirty player at league because he may have could say that he learned his sparring from one of the world's greats. Meanwhile, Bell, who has a copy of the picture at home, still rates it amongst his greatest ever experiences. I think back, you know, about some of the famous people I've sort of met and I've been lucky enough to meet the queen herself at Buckingham Palace. But without doubt Palace but without doubt the most famous sportsperson and probably the arguably the most famous sports person ever would have to be Muhammad Ali and what are the chances when you think about it you know trillion's the one I suppose the photojournalism New Zealand charity auction will be held in New Plymouth in September. Nine minutes to 8 on R&Z National. Now, a quick note in Bay of Plenty. There's been a serious crash. It's closed State Highway Tour to near Matata between the Pacific Coast Highway and State Highway 34. A detour is available for traffic headed via East Bank Road and the Pacific Coast Highway. Kiatupato, be careful in the area. It's 9 to 8. Well, police maintain they are cracking down on the two gangs, the tribesmen and killer bees, who are at the centre of a surge in violence across Tamaki Makuro. Seven people have been arrested so far with four guns and 250 rounds of ammunition seized by police. They're looking for a variety of weapons following the recent shooting spree. Andrew Costa, the police commissioner is with us us now. Morina, good morning. Good morning, Karen. So you're cracking down. What are you doing that is out of the ordinary here to prevent an end this spurge of extra gun violence we're seeing? Our approach with situations like this where you've got groups at war is to target any activity that we can find as an opportunity to send them a message that's what we're doing with these groups so no the 10 search warrants, the people we've arrested and we will keep doing that until the violence stops. Of course we keep investigating the offences themselves but where you have groups at war it's a little bit different from where you're trying to track down a particular individual. Right, Jared Gilbert, the gang expert was talking about this last week. This is a, what, so you effectively make their life a misery by pinging them on every little thing you can? We find everything we can, and that's to send a message that, you know, this way of behaving is completely unacceptable. And eventually that combined with the stress that they feel from being at war does tend to calm these things down. And that's what we will keep doing. Clearly it's incredibly unnerving for those communities affected and I really feel for them in the situation. What assurance can you give them that it is going to end, those communities? Look, these things, unfortunately, come in waves, and you know, we're at a time of peak tension between those groups at the moment. That's incredibly unfortunate. We are doing absolutely everything we can to target those groups. We'll also take opportunity if it presents to de-escalate between the groups and whatever we need to do to settle the situation down. Have you sought a truce or some sort of meeting between the leaders? We have had some conversations about that, and I'm aware that some meeting has occurred, but I'm not going to go into the detail of that because it's not helpful in terms of actually getting a resolution. Okay, without going into detail, you're confirming, though, that there has been a meeting between gang bosses to try and de-escalate this? There has been at least one meeting, and we will continue to encourage that where the opportunity presents. We need to be realistic. There's obviously strong feeling between these groups. And so our primary tactic of putting on the pressure until they pull heads in will continue. Why? What is your understanding of the reason for this latest flare-up? Look, I don't think you can ever point to a good reason for a flare-up of this nature. This violence is completely unacceptable. You'll have some awareness of the history in terms of, you know, a life-changing injury to the leaders of one of the groups, to the leader of one of the groups. I'm sure that's part of it. But in the end, there are deep-running tensions between them, and that's as it is. I mean, you know who's involved here? You know who the participants are? Well, we clearly know who the members are and we know who a lot of the protagonists are, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you can prove that at a given point in time someone discharged a firearm. And so we have to take a broad approach to the group. No, no, but does it enable you, sorry to interrupt, does it enable you to take preventative measures in terms of, would the legal avenues you have available to you for surveillance and those sorts of things? Look, it certainly gives us a place to start. Clearly, from a police perspective, we can target unlawful behaviour. And so that's, you know, we're the law places us, and that's our job. So that's what we will do. The issues surrounding groups of this nature clearly run much broader than that and have a relationship, you know, social and other challenges connected to them. Do you have, I mean, we have some forms of firearms protection orders? I mean, do you need those extended as some have suggested to enable you to, say, stop vehicles and search without a warrant for firearms of an own gang member, this sort of thing? Obviously, there's legislation in front of Parliament at the moment that's being debated on this point. Clearly, police will use whatever tools we have available to us to target, you know, unlawful gang behaviour. The balance to be struck in terms of what's considered reasonable in a free democracy is not for police, that's for Parliament, and, you know, we'll see where those things land. Okay. What about the issue, I mean, would it have been helpful, or would it be helpful to have armed response teams right now that would provide some extra layer of protection and speed to a response? We have armed defenders, squad, staff available 24-7 at the moment to deal with. some extra layer of protection and speed to a response? We have armed defenders squad staff available 24-7 at the moment to deal with. Are they mobile though? Are they moving around? They will be, we're required into particular locations. It was undefender squad staff who made one of the key arrests this week and recovered those firearms so they are available and of course in counties Monaco district they're also a pilot district for our tactical response model so we've got 200 million dollars worth of funding in the budget that will see us scale up the availability of specialist staff to deal with these situations so what might that look like in the future there's a couple of aspects to this and we need to be in mind we're still finishing the proofs of concept but we've got our tactical prevention teams who are focused on dealing with high risk offenders so the aim here is to deal with people recover firearms etc before they become an issue for intelligence lead enforcement and they're also then available to deal with what might present. And then also tactical dog teams, so our dog units moving to be two-up vehicles with a tactical operator as part of it. And again, you know, those units are sent to the high-risk jobs. What would you say to Aucklanders this morning who are hearing of increased ram raids, gang shootings in their city at the moment, and feeling unsafe? Have police lost control? Absolutely not, but we are in very concerning times. You know, much of the existing problems we had have been aggravated by COVID. If we think about youth crime, you know, why have we got so many kids who haven't re-engaged with school post-COVID? When we think about our town centres, well, you know, we all really worked from home and kind of left those town centres to whoever was left through the last two years. That will change as people come back in as police are able to move away from COVID policing and get back to our core business. But these challenges that we have will be longer running in our communities as we transition back to something like normal. Andrew Costa, police commissioner, appreciate your time this morning on Morning Report. It is two minutes to eight. A little bit of time for some feedback. You've been getting in touch in droves on the supermarket duopoly and the moves the government is making. Anaru texts 2101 saying, we keep talking up Aldi and other overseas providers to compete with our two supermarkets, but wouldn't it be fantastic if we had a homegrown owner as a third major player to give us a real Kiwi choice? And Marcia says my questions are how will it affect suppliers? Will lower prices in stores mean our local fruit and veggie producers are also forced to accept a lower price while the companies still make their large profits. Also, will the companies cry poor when staff come up for a pay rise? This one says the government's loving the media attack on supermarkets. It's diverting attention away from the horrific cost-of-living increase that they're responsible for and don't know how to fix food cost is only a small piece of the cost-of-living explosion. Hi-a-good morning, New Zealand. You're listening to Morning Report on Arnzad National. It is a fine day for the east of the Maltu. The rest of the country gets rain or showers with possible thunderstorms. Call Susie Ferguson, Tokoingawa. Atomaliyah, Korandane 10A, in this hour, consumer New Zealand gives us their take on the government's moves to rain in supermarket profits. National says numerous attempts to get answers about the handling of February's protest at Parliament have been blocked. Also before nine, stench-affected Bromley residents say the $200 support package rollout has been a shambles. We look ahead to the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. And there are boars, pigs, that is, on the loose in Rome. RNZ News at 8 o'clock. Good morning, I'm Nicola Wright. The finance minister won't say whether ALDI is among the supermarket chains the government hopes to lure over the Tasman in a bid to boost competition. Supermarkets will be forced to open up their wholesale arms to would-be rivals by the end of the year and land banking covenants will be stopped. Grant Robertson told Morning Report that will help operators such as the warehouse and Costco and other players here and in Australia. Supermarkets were taking about a million dollars a day and excess profits from New Zealand. We've already seen the likes of the warehouse put more products on the shelves. We've got interest from a number of other players. They need to know that they've got places they can build supermarkets and they have access to goods. Grant Robertson says the changes will give smaller supermarket businesses the confidence to expand. The police commissioner says a meeting's been held between gang leaders to de-escalate the street violence. The tribesmen and killer bees are at the centre of a surge in violence across Thamaki Makado. Seven people have been arrested so far, with four guns and 250 rounds of ammunition seized by police. Andrew Costa told Morning Report he believes targeting gangs with warrants and other actions can calm violence down. The Prime Minister is downplaying the significance of the Pacific Tour by China's foreign minister, describing it as routine diplomacy. She's in Washington, D.C., preparing to meet with the US President Joe Biden tomorrow. Wang Yi is on an eight-country tour, signing various agreements, spanning security as well as trade. Jacinda Ardern says while the pace and level of engagement from China has stepped up, what's happening now is not new. What's been described to me is that it has, by and large, been routine diplomatic engagement. And I think we do need to just take a step back and remember that, of course, China has been present in the Pacific and active in the Pacific and across infrastructure projects and built relationships over a number of years. Jacinda Arden denies New Zealand is missing in action diplomatically in the Pacific. Meanwhile another member of the Prime Minister's delegations tested positive for COVID and is now isolating in Washington, D.C. This is the third member of her group to catch COVID in the US. Hawks Bay Health Services are being stretched as winter illnesses have hit the region. The 24-7 medical centre in Napier was closed yesterday because of staff illness. Hawks Bay DHB's Chief Medical Officer Robin Wyman says the hospital's emergency department is seeing a record number of people while at the same time dealing with a critical shortage of staff. COVID we have flu patients presenting as well with some admissions to hospital. We have had norovirus within the hospital. It is still in the community. And we have the normal winter illnesses and medical presentations which also create load on the system. Robin Wyman says people with minor symptoms should isolate at home and contact their GP. The latest one-news Cantar public poll shows it's still neck and neck between the left and right party groups. The poll shows neither major party would be able to form a government with their traditional partners. Our political reporter, Anika Smith, has more. Last night's poll has put paid to any hopes the budget's cost of living sweeteners would boost the Labour government's popularity. National is holding steady at 39% of the vote, as Labor slips another two points to 35%. The Greens are on 10% and act on seven. The Greens are on 10% and act on seven. On these numbers, Te Party MƒÅori, with 2% could play Kingmaker for National or go with labour in what would be a hung parliament. National's leader, Christopher Luxon, says it's too early to discuss how it might form a government. Australia's Labour Party has won enough seats in federal parliament to form a majority government, meaning it won't rely on cross-benchers to pass legislation in the lower house. The ABC's Tom Lorry has the details. The ABC projects Labor will retain the Melbourne seat of McNamara despite a strong challenge from the Greens. With that seat called, the party has reached 76, enough to govern in its own right. That total could climb higher still, with two seats still in doubt, Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast and Deakin in Melbourne's east. While the party can pass legislation through the lower house on its own, it will still need to find support from the Greens, crossbench or opposition in the Senate. The new government is taking shape. An epidemiologist says it would be a great loss to the scientific community if the New Zealand Medical Journal folds. Since 1887, the journals published scientific papers and articles about all aspects of New Zealand health. The Medical Association, which runs it, is going into liquidation and is seeking new owners for it. Otago University epidemiologist Nick Wilson says the journal allows a voice for the health and science communities raising unique New Zealand issues. I think it would be very disappointing if the journal was discontinued and I really hope that a university or another organisation can pick up the management of it. The Medical Association says it is optimistic it will find a group to take over the journal. The new Top Gun movie has given the Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise his first $100 million opening weekend at the box office. Top Gun Maverick sees him reprise his role as US Navy pilot Pete Maverick Mitchell from the original 1986 film. Paramount Pictures says the sequel earned an estimated $189 million New Zealand dollars in ticket sales in its first three days in North American theatres. Worldwide, that figures an estimated $378 million. That's the news. The Post here's Barry Guy. The polls say they're not thinking about the minor premiership after last night's 51-43 win over the tactics in Christchurch, which took them top of the A&Z Premiership standings ahead of the Mystics. The Pulse and Mystics meet on Friday to decide the top seed for the playoffs and who will host the grand final. Pulse co-captain Tiana Maturo told Sky Sports she's glad they overcame a few issues against the tactics which sets them up well for what lies ahead. It's promising looking ahead for the next couple of weeks and we're not sure what it looks like just yet but suppose it's almost a sense of reality that our home final could be is potential so yeah I guess we're just taking it one day at a time. The Pulse and Mystics are level on points with the Pulsarhead on goal difference. Blake's coach coached says Brenda McCollum will have an instant impact as England coach but he also believes the former New Zealand skipper will be under a lot of pressure. England have won just one of their last 17 tests and fans are expecting a big shift under McCollum and new captain Ben Stokes. Anytime you get a new captain, new coach, I guess new managing director as well, then there'll be a lot of eyes on those guys around the change and what they might, I guess, instigate. But Brendan will bring that heart-on-the-sleeve type play, I'm sure, into that England squad. Stead is named a 15-player squad for the three test series with the Blake Cap set to be without batter Henry Nichols and strike bowler Trint Bolt for the first test series with the Blake Cap set to be without batter, Henry Nichols, and strike bowler Trint Bolt for the first test at Lords, which starts Thursday night.

And you're listening to Morning Reports. Moves to shake up the supermarket duopoly are getting the thumbs up from consumer advocacy groups. The government has accepted all but two of the recommendations from a Commerce Commission study in supermarkets. It's instead taking an even harder line on those recommendations, opting for annual reviews of competition in the sector and a mandatory wholesale access regime. Now, while it's stopped short of forcing the two big chains to sell off assets, the Consumer Affairs Minister David Clark told Checkpoint that is still an option. We certainly had not ruled that out. In fact, we're devoting extra results to looking into that. Retail investment. What is needed is detailed cost-benefit analysis on that because we want to be sure that that's the best route. I expect to make further announcements on that this year. Maybe that it's better to have small chains expanding rather than giving over-store space. But it may be that giving over-store space is the best way to get there. We need to do the homework on it. John Duffy is Chief Executive of Consumer New Zealand and with us now. Morana. Morena. So these moves, are they bold enough? Look, I think the government's take a really pragmatic approach to the Commission's findings. They've agreed with the bulk of them, but they've disagreed on those two key points that you outland in your intro where I think New Zealanders were demanding further action and where further action obviously was needed. So we're really pleased with where the government standard. Is there going to be enough transparency, though, around the wholesale regime? Because the duopoly will still have control of that? They will. And that's unavoidable because the duopoly will still have control of that? They will and that's unavoidable because the duopoly has, I guess, the real estate and the supply agreements and the distribution networks and that is a problem. However, if the right rules are put in place, the duopoly won't be able to act unfairly towards competitors. And, you know, over the longer term, we would see this wholesale access regime, probably being an interim step, to allow new entrants to get into the market or existing players to expand. And then over time, they'll develop their own wholesale networks and become kind of completely independent. So all at all, very pleased. Okay. So just to sort of stay with the wholesale situation for a moment, is there a risk that it could not only not be as transparent as perhaps people would want to see? Could it also create greater dependence on the two chains because of their unique position? Look, I think initially, yes. The two, the duopolis are the only players in the New Zealand market that can. because of their unique position? Look, I think initially, yes. The two, the Duopolis are the only players in the New Zealand market that can provide this service. So we are dependent on them. And that kind of goes back to the question, should we have found ourselves in this position in the first place? And the Commerce Commission clearly found that, no, competition is not working well for consumers and others, so we shouldn't have found ourselves in that position. But we've got to deal with it. We've got to be pragmatic and work our way through it. So this is probably the best option at this stage. What about other players coming into the market? We spoke earlier about an hour ago, in fact, to Grant Robertson, the acting prime minister, and he seemed to be indicating that there were other players that were looking very seriously at the New Zealand market. Is that likely? This could help. So the Congress Commission has taken to... Sorry, the government's taken two immediate steps. They've freed up the covenants that were sitting on land, that were stopping new entrants effectively setting up next door to a competing supermarket. So that's a really important step. And now they're addressing over the next six months the wholesale supermarket. So that's a really important step. And now they're addressing over the next six months the wholesale regime. So a new entrant now can buy land, and in theory will soon be able to buy wholesale groceries to sell. So, yeah, I would imagine there are overseas companies having a good look because we certainly know from the Commission's findings that there's plenty of profits to be made, so they'll probably want to slice of that. So in terms of prices, when will consumers actually see prices dropping at the supermarkets? Well, as both ministers pointed out yesterday, both Woolworths and foodstuffs have moved to kind of take unilateral steps to drop prices on certain items. That's a good sign. But ultimately, they won't do that. My view is that we won't see wholesale reduction in prices until we see that right in competition. So it could be some months, if not years away, before we see that come into effect properly. Namihi, thank you very much for your time. John Duffy there of Consumer New Zealand, quarter past eight. Let's get some more analysis on this now with our business editor, Giles Bekford. Good morning, Charles. So meaningful price reductions might take some time. But, you know, momentum pressure has been building. They are already, you would argue, the supermarket chains responding with sort of price, winter price measures. It's having some effect. Let's get the cliche out the way. The devil will be in the detail of the new regime. The government is proposing for the wholesale side of the industry. I have to say that there is an appearance of activity overachievement about this announcement. And I say that because the supermarkets have been giving ground. In fact, in the Commerce Commission hearings through last year and into the beginning of this year, they had already conceded a code of conduct. Yep, we're happy with that. They wanted it to be voluntary, rather than mandatory, but they can live with that depending on how it's worded and the dispute's resolution and that sort of thing Opening up wholesale well that's an arguable one While they are in control they of course are the ones who are setting the prices by and large and how do we know? Will there be its transparency around that price setting? Well that's the very point I'll make That's the devil that will'll be waiting to see. I mean, in the fullness of time, you would hope that, yes, pressures on them would lead to lower prices. Of course, it's the way, you know, there are two sides of the coin. One of the supplying the small retailers so that we don't see our local dairy owners going around competing with us at the checkout market with their two dozen coaks and their bog rolls. But on the other side there's the small food suppliers, the small producers who complain about the way they've been treated in the past about trying to get their goods on the shelves, the conditions, the costs that are imposed upon them. Well, they should have more protection now, right? One would assume so, under this new code of conduct with fair dealing and the like. Looking at the potential supermarkets, you know, possible new entrants, I have to say, this is the will of the wisp. This is the waiting for Godo moment, right? the will of the wisp. This is the waiting for Goddo moment, right? And Aldi, which moved into Australia over a decade ago and picked up around 13% of the Australian market. It has been tipped to be coming to New Zealand ever since it appeared in Australia. And as I say, waiting for Godot, because the two people sitting on the bench discussing the meaning of life and the supermarket industry, countdown and foodstuffs, right? And the person who never turns up, Goddow, is Aldi. And as recent as March this year, Aldi was saying, we've got no plans to come to New Zealand. It was interesting. I mean, I thought that Grant Robertson was sort of hinting that they might have been talking about it, but others have suggested no, he wasn't, but clearly the government would want them to be. But surely the issue is that they have made the, so we've got the land issue, the covenant's issue, so the land banking, you can't have supermarkets, hogging all the great land. That's being done. That was a point conceited. Wholesale thing opened up. Surely they must see a business opportunity here. There must be something. Well, look, one of the calculations done by Tex Edwards, who's from North Thelia, who were one of the sort of, they're a potential supermarket operator. He described himself as the monopoly buster. He did a quick calculation, which he shared with the Commerce Commission, saying that for a significant competitor to break into the current market, they need about a 15% market share. And his back of the envelope calculations were that's about 150 shops in the major centres and a capital investment of $3.5 billion. Costco, opening up in Auckland, it's a hundred million dollar plus store. Well, the warehouse has got to be the only option then, doesn't it? The warehouse, of course, as we were hearing from Catherine Rich earlier in the program, they've been there before in a limited fashion. They're largely dry goods. You don't get your fresh fruit and veggies in your meat there, but you do get the things needed for the laundry and the bathroom and toilet rolls and dog food and canned food. They would probably need to reconfigure some of their stores to make them, A, comply with sort of the health and safety and food safety rules. Nick Graysden, the CEO of the warehouse said, we're certainly interested, but we'll approach it cautiously. We'll be looking for details of what the government is suggesting. So there's a prospect there, as Catherine Rich was saying, they've got 90-odd stores around the country. In a lot of places, of course, we have small town, small provincial centres. They only have one supermarket. And you still want to get the goods there. You still want to... That's right. And indeed, in some places, you're lucky to have a supermarket at all. So, the prospect of somebody coming right through and promoting competition from top to bottom of the country, I think it's a bit of a fond hope. The best I think that might be expected is that this will be the start of the relentless pressure on the big two to start behaving responsibly and pricing their goods accordingly. Charles Beckford, Business Illiter, thank you very much for that. It is 20 minutes past eight. A bit of traffic news to update you on in Fangare, at State Highway 1, Raumanga, a truck breakdown is blocking a lane near the State Highway 1 and Rewa-Rewa Road intersection in Raumanga. Please pass the scene with Kerkya, Thupato and expect delays. Down to bay of plenty, a serious crash has closed State Highway 2 near Matata between the Pacific Coast Highway and State Highway 34. A detour is available for traffic headed via East Bank Road between the Pacific Coast Highway and State Highway 34. A detour is available for traffic headed via East Bank Road and the Pacific Coast Highway. Now, a massive failure. That is how Bromley residents are describing the first day of Christchurch City Council's support package for those living with the horrendous stench from the damaged wastewater plant. The package was launched yesterday with over 3,000 households told they could get well-being and financial support at four different community centres. But as Neva Chittock reports, that's not what happened. Community advocate Stephen McPake describes the launch as an utter disaster. Some of the hubs were not open, that they ran out of Prezzy cards really early in the morning. The communication about things wasn't going out fast enough and our Facebook page was getting information out faster than what council could. Prezy cards appear to be the preferred option for households collecting their $200 support payment to help cover medical appointments and other stench-related costs. Eligible resident Damien Alley says he overheard community centre staff talking about how they'd had to go out and purchase as many prezy cards as they could from the supermarket because the council never delivered any. Just a shambles, absolute shambles. So the council have not done anything they said they were going to do. And paperwork's not there. The presi cards aren't there. And bang Monday, everybody turned up and there was only 85 presi cards. The council had originally said all residents needed to access the funds was proof of address. But Council spokesperson Gary Watson says people pinching post put a stop to that. And we're now asking for a second form of identification. Over the weekend it became clear on social media that there was some people that were going from probably out of the area who were looking to take advantage of this. Bromley residents have complained that they weren't told about this extra requirement, and Gary Watson admits some information booklets weren't delivered. Stephen McPake says internal communication isn't any better. The council only briefed its elected community board members in the worst affected area last night. Too little too late. Our Facebook page has informed the elected members of the community boards more than the council has. And they feel rather upset and a little bit hacked off that they're finding more out from the residents than they do from council. He says businesses in the council designated area have not been offered any form of support and people's health and well-being is still not being prioritised. It's left residents considering legal action. The support package has been a massive fail. The community is up in arms. They're calling for a class action law suit. I've suggested a protest as a way to get council to open their eyes and listen to the community. Damien Ellie wants a different approach taken. Create a door-knocking team, go door to door and check on the welfare, check on the people and give them their presid card whilst they're there for doing the questionnaire. Then at least we're building a register on the health and welfare check on the people and give them their Presley Card whilst they're there for doing the questionnaire. Then at least we're building a register on the health and welfare check of the people. Christchurch City Council's million dollar package includes $200,000 going to 23 affected schools and preschools in setting up a health register. It is 24 minutes past 8. You're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Well, the National Party says numerous attempts to get answers about the handling of February's Parliament protest have been blocked. Correspondence seen by RNZ shows Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard refusing to answer several written questions from the opposition. On numerous occasions, Mr Mallard says a comment would prejudice the ongoing inquiry by the Independent Police Conduct Authority. National MP people Paul Goldsmith is with us now. Good morning. Good morning, Corin. How are you going? Very well. What is the issue here? Look, it's a long-running saga about the government being determined to avoid any accountability for the protests that, as we all know, got out of control, who are massively and disruptive, followed by a destructive riot that was violence, but could easily have been worse. And what we've seen since then is a cone of silence until some of the issues will be dealt by the IPCA inquiry in 2024. So the issue here is, though, you've asked questions of Trevor Mallard, and relating to his inquiry in 2024. So the issue here is though you've asked questions of Trevor Mallard and relating to his involvement in handling of it, but he's come back and said what that he can't say anything because of the inquiry. You don't accept that? Well, of course the inquiry the IPCA inquiry deals only with the actions of police and their interaction with other people. So if we're asking the speaker about his interactions with the Prime Minister's office, that's clearly outside the scope of the IPCA. It's nothing to do with the police. And yet he's coming back and saying, oh, no, I can't answer that because we have this inquiry. But the difficulty is that the speaker generally is the referee that forces ministers to actually reply properly. When the person who's supposed to be doing that enforces ministers to actually reply properly. When the person who's supposed to be doing the enforcing isn't replying properly himself, we're left in a bit of a bind. And you're adamant that the, so you mentioned one of the examples of a question you asked there, that they would be outside the scope of this police inquiry. Yeah, well, some of them are. And so it leaves us in the very invidious situation. Look, when somebody else is in the gun, government ministers are very quick to start inquiries and to hang people out to dry and get to the bottom of what's gone wrong. But when they themselves are the subject of tricky questions, they clam up and shut the door. And when it comes to getting some accountability and an understanding of what happens, we cannot wait two years for a IPCA inquiry to be the first time we get some clarity around these events. But that's what they're trying to push through with a majority in Parliament. Do we know the scope and the terms of reference for the police inquiry? I mean, how far can it go? Do we have any confidence that it will cover some of these issues that you're concerned about? Well, by its very nature, the police complaint subpoit, looks at the actions of the police, which is an absolutely important part of the inquiry. But as we've always said along, but there are also actions by non-police, like the Speaker, like government ministers, like parliamentary security, a whole lot of areas that need to be dealt with which aren't directly resulting from the police. And that's always been the ongoing run. And the Prime Minister said initially that, oh, yes, we'll look into this, but ultimately they've done nothing and are just hunkering down, hoping that the issue will go away. And, you know, we see it as our role in opposition to keep asking these impertinent questions because it's important. Yes, and just finally, I mean, you can't, what is your next step here if you're trying to seek these questions from the Speaker? You can raise it in Parliament, I presume, but it's, as you say, the Speaker is the adjudicator in a sense. Oh, yes, we just have to keep finding new inventive ways to raise the issue, try and embarrass them into being a little bit more open. You know, this is the government that promised to be open and transparent, and that they aren't being, and ultimately they don't enjoy being reminded of that, and we see it as our role to try and get to the bottom of, like I say, what was one of the most disruptive periods in Wellington's history. Went home for a long period of time, a lot of damage, a lot of money involved. It's not unreasonable to ask for some answers to some basic questions. Paul Goldsmith, thank you very much for your time. That is National MP Paul Goldsmith, 28 minutes past eight. And let's get an update now on the markets shortly. Well, we would be getting an update on the markets, but John Beck was more here. Well, that's the Wall Street markets. I think it's, what, a memorial day or something like that in the US at the moment. As I'm, oh, hang on a minute. I can seem running towards the studio. European markets, I think. I was thinking maybe it was going to be someone else who'd do the updates that was perhaps in Auckland. Here he is. And indeed it is, Giles Beckford. Just closing the door there. Giles, do come on in, have a seat. Pop your headphones on. We're ending to do this seamlessly. Hang on. Cura, Giles, what's happening on the markets? Cura, Susie. Seameless as always. Well, we should say it's a pretty muted tone out there on financial markets, obviously with Wall Street being closed for a long weekend. European market, so they had quite a reasonable session. London was up 0.2%. The other main ones, Germany, France, and the broader pan-European indices, gaining around 2 thirds to 3 quarters of a percent. The reason for it is signs that Shanghai in particular will start reopening for business tomorrow, moves to boost the local economy there. I hope there that that will help to relieve some of the supply chain disruptions as well as boost demand. Our own top 50 index up three quarters of a percent, 80 points at 11,146. New Zealand dollar becalmed at 65.6 US cents, 91.1 Australian, 51.8 British Pence, 0.608 euro, 83.6 Japanese yen and 4.37 Chinese yuan. I can say Bitcoin is up 6% back over around 32,000 US dollars a coin. Brent crude oil, up a couple of dollars, just under 2%. At $121 US $70 a barrel. That's a two-month high. And gold is up $3.50 to $1,855 US dollars1,855 an ounce. We have seminars from the Commerce Commission looking at gas pricing and the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank talking about recent interest rate arises, that and all the other business news and numbers a little bit earlier than usual at around 10 past 12 in Midday Report. Kiora, thank you very much, Giles. If Iakene, still to come before nine here on Morning Report, we'll be speaking to the Productivity Commissioner, who's calling for immigration policymaking to be made more transparent. Also, the Maori Party and the National Maori Authority are backing calls to set up an Iwi bank, and the Queen's Platinum Jubilee is being celebrated across the Commonwealth this week. Kirtatai, Montecu Porongango, now news headlines in Nicola Wright. The country's third largest grocery group, night and day, as pleased steps are being taken to increase competition in the supermarket sector. The government has begun its clampdown to tackle the countdown and foodstuffs duopoly, including introducing a watchdog and code of conduct. The supermarket giants have also been told to open up their wholesale arms to competitors at a fair price. Night and Day's general manager Matthew Lane says the steps will allow his stores to provide value they can't now by getting access to cheaper products. The police commissioner says a meeting's been held between gang leaders over a surge in violence across Auckland. Tensions between the tribesmen and killer bees are at the centre of the attacks. Seven people have been arrested so far and four guns and 250 rounds of ammunition seized by police. Andrew Costa told Morning Report he believes targeting gangs with warrants and other actions can calm violence down. The MƒÅori Party and the National MƒÅori Authority are backing calls for the establishment of an Iwi bank to finance building on MƒÅori land. It's difficult for Farno to borrow from commercial banks to build on their own land as the land can't be used as security for the mortgage. The authorities chair Matthew Tukaki suggests a cooperative bank model would work well for MƒÅori. European Union ambassadors have again failed to reach an agreement on banning imports of oil from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The envoys were trying to break a stalemate on the issue before a summit of EU leaders later today. Hungary, which relies heavily on Russian oil, is the main opponent of the ban, which it likens to dropping a nuclear bomb on its economy. Christchurch City Council admits it vastly underestimated the number of presi cards needed in the wastewater stench support package. More than 3,000 of the worst affected households in the suburb of Bromley were able to access financial and well-being support from yesterday. Presi cards were among the options for households collecting their $200 support payment. However, community centres ran out on day one. That's the news. Giorda, I'm Amel Bonovan, and today on the detail, Jacinda Ardern goes stateside. Why is she there? What's in it for us and what's in it for them? People often say, you know, are we going to be forced to choose between their China and the United States? You know, we chose ages ago to be an open, liberal market, economy, a democracy. To the extent that all of that matters in the Pacific, yeah, we are becoming more important to the United States. The detail on Apple, Spotify, RNZ, or wherever you get your podcasts.

They're listening to Morning Reports with Corindan and Susie Ferguson. Now, the Productivity Commission is calling for immigration policy making to be made more transparent. It says immigration policy has profound effect on families, communities, businesses, and those who aspire to call Altaire at home. Yet immigration policy appears to be decided in a black box. Commission Chair Ganeshana is with us. Kiyura. So why is there a reluctance for transparency? appears to be decided in a black box. Commission Chair Ganeshana is with us. Keora. So why is there a reluctance for transparency here? Well, I'm not sure there is a reluctance. I just think it's the way things have happened in the past. There hasn't been those connections between the various arms of government that's needed. And immigration, let us say, continues. It appears to be in that black box disconnected from decisions about infrastructure and decisions about workforce training and other items. Seems extraordinary that that kind of stuff wouldn't be connected. Well I think the thing for most government processes is to get the vehicle to ensure that they are connected and transparent and that's why we suggest a government policy statement which ensures that governments are making transparent decisions and have to tell us how those decisions, immigration in this example, is connected to our investment in infrastructure and our investment in workforce planning. Are you thinking that that is likely to happen and what should it state explicitly? Well I think well what action state will depend on the government of the day because a government of the day will make different decisions in terms of the trade-offs between the short term and the long-term challenges that we face. What we would hope is to make those challenges and those trade-offs a lot more transparent so that we are aware where we're heading and so then businesses and communities can plan accordingly. Because without something like that, people are very much in the dark, aren't they? We are very much in the dark, both businesses and communities, and we are subject to, I suppose, short-term considerations and whether it's a response to businesses wanting skilled labour and the short-term solution is to bring in migrants, but how does that link into what we're doing on workforce planning for the future? It's getting the balance, not only getting the balance right, but getting the balance transparent so we complain accordingly. And what sort of plans do you anticipate coming as a result of this? What kind of ripple effect, assuming that this is something that has paid attention to? Well, I think what we'd like is something that's a lot more certain in terms of the long-term path for migrants, not just for migrants themselves, but also for New Zealanders, or other New Zealanders who are resident here already. Migrants contribute to New Zealand's productivity and wellbeing and will continue to do so, but it's that certainty that enables us to do the investment in infrastructure and also enable us to, I suppose, leverage off the connections to other parts of the world and bring in new talent and bring in new innovation and new ways of doing things. All of those things come off the back of our connections with the world and it's getting that certainty over the long term that we're after. Do you think this is likely to get any traction? Well, one would hope so. It's with the ministers at the moment that we're after. Do you think this is likely to get any traction? Well, one would hope so. It's with the ministers at the moment, and we're keen to continue the conversation and just reinforce that this is for the long term, and that was what our terms of reference. So it's been a long while since we've looked at immigration carefully from this strategic perspective, not since the 1980s have we done it in this detail. So I think now's the good time to set something in stone that will service well for the future decades. Namihi, Ganesh Nana there. Productivity Commission Chair, 20 to 9. There is still silence from state broadcaster TVNZ about the abrupt departure of new breakfast show host Kamal Santa Maria. TVNZ won't answer questions about a sudden resignation, quitting after less than a month on the job. Acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson says the broadcasting minister has made inquiries with TVNZ's board and is awaiting a response. Newsroom co-eater to Mark Jennings gave the then-18-year-old Santa Maria his first job in the industry as a sports reporter when he was the news director at TV3. Mark Jennings joins us now. Good morning. Good morning, Corny. The handling of this episode, in your view, do you think it has been well handled? No, it looks like it's been quite incompetently handled, really. You know, it started off as a famine emergency, and then it became a personal matter. Then it became a resignation. And now there are all sorts of other questions around it. So, no, this doesn't look good at all for TVNZ, in my view. The help, there are some people listening to this story this morning and wondering why we're covering it? Why is it that TVNZ, the state broadcaster, the story like this, needs to be covered? Well, I think there are a couple of reasons, really. First of all, these are high-profile roles in New Zealand. I mean, potentially, if it was in a bigger country, some of our television presenters wouldn't be major news, but here in New Zealand, these are very prominent roles and play quite a major, I guess, you know, part of our news fabric. Also, I guess you want to know that there's a high level of trust in the individuals doing these jobs. And, you know, you also want to know that the state broadcaster as processes when it comes to hiring people are carried out correctly. Yes, and it seems as though certainly some staff at TVNZ have reportedly said they're not happy with the way in which that appointment was made. Yes, that's what we're hearing too, and that Kamal Santibuio was basically parachuted into this role, that perhaps the producers of the show that he was working on were not consulted and and I think the big question though is what reference checks or due diligence was carried out because if the claims that are now coming out that he behaved inappropriately towards young female colleagues while he was at Al Jazeera. If these are true, then it looks like a slip-up in terms of how the vetting perhaps was carried out. So does that mean there will be pressure now on news management? I think there's a lot of pressure on news management and not just news management. I think senior management, including the CEO of TVNZ, will all be under pressure from, I think, you know, two sources. The minister of broadcasting Chris Farfoil who want to know that there hasn't been anything untoward going on here. And I think TVNZ-owned newsroom will want answers around this as well because, you know, this sort of can affect the reputation of news services, can affect the ratings. So they will want Simon Power to sort it out too. So what needs to happen next? Does there need to be, does TVNZ need, I mean, there will be legal issues around this. What should they do in terms of fronting up and answering questions to the public, not least the government? Well, if they can't come out and answer them themselves straight away, then potentially they need to get someone in to inquire into what happens, some independent person, a bit like MediaWorks did when they had some cultural issues as well. They got a QC in to look at it. I mean, something like that may well be appropriate here. I mean, there is a new CEO there now in Simon Power. There's an opportunity for him to take some leadership here? Yes, exactly, and I think he will need to take some leadership, particularly when we've got the, if you like, the merger of TVNZ and R&Z or the new public entity coming up, Simon Power will want to be a candidate for the top job there, and I think there'll be a bit of focus on how he handles this problem or this issue right now as to the sort of his future prospects for that role. Mark Jennings, appreciate your time former Cours TV3 News Boss and now Newsroom co-editor. It is quarter to nine. The hunt is on for new publishers for the New Zealand Medical Journal. With warnings, it would be a big loss if it folded. The organisation that runs the journal, the New Zealand Medical Association, is said to go into liquidation after struggling financially for years. That puts the survival of the 135-year-old publication under threat. Our health correspondent Rowan Quinn has more. The New Zealand medical journals are one-of-year-old publication under threat. Our health correspondent, Rowan Quinn, has more. The New Zealand medical journals are one-of-a-kind, publishing studies and articles from across the country's medical professions. Otago University epidemiologist Nick Wilson is irregular in its pages, which are digital these days. He says it would be a great pity if it folded. Often New Zealand health workers and scientists will preferentially go for a local journal because they really do want to get coverage in a local audience and be able to discuss things that are uniquely relevant to the country. The New Zealand Medical Association, which is an advocacy group for some health professionals as well, says it wants to find another group willing and financially able to take over the journal. There are other medical journals here, but many of them cover certain specialties like paediatrics and are for Australia too. GP and Otago University Professor Sue Crenge says that means New Zealand's specific stories often don't get the same level of coverage. That includes uniquely MƒÅori content in the journal. It has a history of publishing articles that look at specific MƒÅori health outcomes or equity issues and even more importantly, just in the last year, they've actually had MƒÅori editors as well. Both professors say the studies and articles are widely read and helped to build understanding on the front lines of health and also at the decision-making tables. Professor Wilson says the findings are also often picked up in the news media, leading to greater understanding and sometimes change. I think it would be very disappointing if the journal was discontinued, and I really hope that a university or another organisation can pick up the management of it. The Association says it would like the journal to remain editorially independent under future owners. It says it's optimistic it will find a group to take it over. It is 13 minutes to nine. That is time to catch up with Catherine Ryan. With 9 to noon, Catherine. Kiotr, good morning, Tex-Sec. Edwards is with us first this morning, founder of the telecommunications company 2 degrees. He's also part of a consortium looking at setting up a new supermarket chain, were conditions to be right, and as part of the lobby group Monopoly Watch. What does he make of what's been announced about our supermarkets? Travelled overseas lately, pre-depart tests, and the New Zealand Traveller Declaration has some tearing their hair out, including tourists trying to make their way here. I've got to talk to the Travel Agents Association and also to a tourism business about what the impact is. And after 10, electrician David Burt's first book was about depression, something he's hidden for years from friends and colleagues. It spurred him to get involved in improving mental health. The latest is a cracking action thriller novel. Really interesting and diverse career Dave is having it. He's with us after 10. Thank you very much, Catherine. A nurse has told an inquest into the death of a mental health patient at Palmerston North Hospital. She felt like it was a fight to get him admitted. The nurse says she's never experienced another admission like it. Manawatu reporter, Jimmy Ellingham, was at the first day of the inquest into the death of Sean Gray in April 2014. Kjorda, good morning, Jimmy. Yes, good morning. What else did the nurse say? Well, the nurse whose name is suppressed for now, she became emotional at times when giving evidence yesterday. She said Sean Gray was admitted to the hospital emergency department the day before his death. He had turned up at the Mid-Central DHB alcohol and other drug service and collapsed. He had overdosed after being upset at a pharmacist refusal to give him the methadone he wanted. So methadones are drug given to patients to ease them away from their addictions. The nurse says at the emergency ward, Sean Gray told her he had suicidal thoughts, but he wouldn't say more. And what happened next? On April the 16th, 2014, the nurse ward Sean Gray told her he had suicidal thoughts, but he wouldn't say more. And what happened next? On April the 16th, 2014, the nurse took Sean Gray to the mental health ward. He was in a wheelchair and restraints, and he was going to go into the high needs unit there. The nurse says a doctor and a nurse on duty seemed disinterested, and at one stage she thought Sean Gray wouldn't be admitted. She described the ward as noisy and understaffed and she said at the time it had a reputation and culture of being unwelcoming to people being admitted. The handover felt like a fight is all I can say. I was on my own at the nurse's station with a doctor arguing with me about whether she would accept Sean at a nurse who was not listening to me at the time. At one point I actually thought they were going to refuse his admission. Now, she said she was told by another nurse that they didn't want Sean Gray there, and that's despite the fact he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act, so they had no choice. He died that night. Who else gave evidence? Well, the then Mid-Scentral DHB chief medical officer Kenneth Clark spoke about one of the clinicians who in 2013, the year before his death, prescribed Sean Gray with high doses of methadone. That clinician, Dr. Sars Maxwell, she resigned the year before an investigation into her had commenced, and she returned to America. So Kenne of Clark says before she did, concerns about those dosages were discussed with her. An audit of methadone doses being received by all clientele within the mid-central mental health service was undertaken. This confirmed that a number of Dr Maxwell's clients were receiving doses of methadone that could be considered above those recommended with the then current guidelines. Kenne Clark says mid-central lowered doses of methadone to patients such as Sean Gray in a safe manner, but one of the issues at this inquest is the effect of this and of Dr Maxwell over-prescribing drugs. Now, Sean Gray's death has taken eight years to get to a hearing. Was this acknowledged? It was. Right at the beginning of the hearing, coroner Matthew Bates says it couldn't be overlooked. While some of the delay, not all of it's been unavoidable, all of it nonetheless is regrettable. But my hope is that by reaching this point, the hearing finally, getting everyone together into the space to explore what's happened, we can find some answers to exactly what has occurred. Now the coroner has a list of 43 questions he wants to examine throughout the inquest, and that looks at stuff like the levels of staffing at the Mental Health Ward's high needs unit and how often Sean Gray was checked on when he was there. Jimmy, thank you very much for that. That's Manawatu reporter Jimmy Ellingham with that report. It is eight minutes to nine. Well, Rome has survived waves of invasions over the centuries, but now the Eternal City is facing a new problem, an infestation of wild boar. CNN's Barbie Latsanado reports. Rome, you could say, is going to the hogs. Wild boar, that is. City workers are doing everything they can to stop them from inundating the Italian capital, but with little success. Wild boar aren't just a nuisance to residents that concerns officials. There's also a risk that they carry swine flu, which is not dangerous to humans, but could impact the food supply. Together with the wild boar problem, we have a very grave problem because of them. The African swine flu is now in our territory and that is very dangerous. Part of the problem, of course, is that there's plenty to eat when the wild boar come into the city. There are a few options on the table to get rid of the pests. So what do you think the city should do to stop the problem? Kill them. It's the holy way. The holy way is to kill them because they are too much. The city of Rome is working on a plan to do just that by bringing in a group of hunters to call the herd. Estimated to be around 20,000 in and around Rome who come into the city to look for food. Romans are being told not to picnic in areas where the boar graze. They're also told to sanitize shoes and hands before leaving parks. But not everyone agrees with the need to kill these beasts. I don't like this solution. I don't want that killed the wild born because I don't think they are dangerous. I feel good because I see the animals like if I lived in the country, but I live in Rome and near to the center. So for me it's good. It's very good. So far, the wild boar have scared a number of local dogs. But there is little choice since man and beast cannot coexist, at least not easily. That is CNN's Barbie Latsa Nado reporting there at six minutes to nine. Well, much of the United Kingdom and the wider Commonwealth will celebrate Queen Elizabeth's platinum jubilee this week. More than 85,000 people have signed up to host Big Jubilee lunches. The official celebration for the Queen's 70-year reign. Our correspondent Vincent McAvaney is in the UK and is with us now. Kiora, Vincent, thank you for talking to us today. What kind of things are people getting up to? Good morning. Well, we've got a four-day weekend to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee, starting on Thursday and the Royal Family has a full schedule of events. So there will be the trooping of the platinum Jubilee, starting on Thursday. And the royal family has a full schedule of events. So there will be the trooping of the color on Thursday, the Queen's birthday parade taking place with all of those officers, all of those soldiers and horses. And there will be a Royal Gun salute as well. And we'll see the main members of the royal family on the balcony for a big flypast. There's also a national Jubilee Beacons lighting. So be put up around the country, including one that's a very central one outside of Buckingham Palace. Then on Friday, we've got a service of Thanksgiving Thanksgiving Palace, although the Archbishop of Canterbury now cannot do that service because he's got COVID. And then on Saturday, we've got the Derby at Epsom Downs, but we know her magically will not be going, even though it's her favourite horse event, because she is actually going to meet Harry and Megan's daughter for the first time, Lilibut, who is named after her, they're coming over. There will then be a big concert at Buckingham Palace with the likes of Diana Ross, Ed Shearren, Elton, Chan, Andover Shelley, all performing. And then on Sunday, there is the big Jubilee lunch where people up and down the country and around the Commonwealth are being invited to have these huge street parties. And members of the royal family throughout these four days will be dispatched all over the country. They'll be calling in on local events and some of these parties as well. So are people getting the bunting out and quite beside themselves with excitement? Yeah, I mean, it really brings back memories of a decade ago when we had the diamond jubilee, we had all of the sort of 2012 festivities as well. And people are just kind of needing a little bit of a break after all the events of the last two and a half years. So there has been, if you go into any store, I was in the supermarket earlier, it's absolutely packed with kind of barbecue and party food. There's been a big selling for that, despite all of the problems at the moment with the cost of living crisis here. People are just wanting to have a bit of a celebration. So there are, as you say, thousands of parties land across the country, lots of bunting on sale, lots of people just wanting to enjoy this because, as we've seen, the Queen is getting quite fragile now. She obviously had COVID earlier in the year. She hasn't been able to do anywhere near the sort of public events calendar that she did just a few years ago. And so people are just wanting to take this opportunity to try and enjoy the festivities. Now, of course, you mentioned their Prince Harry coming over for this. Does the monarchy need this to go well to be a bit of a boost, I suppose, because there's been the controversy about Harry and Meghan, and of course, the whole Prince Andrews situation? Yeah, they do need this to go well. And they're very different issues, but they do need to kind of be balanced off. So we know that there will be sort of the core balcony family, so the active working royals, so Wills and Kate, Camilla and Prince Charles, and the Queen. I think we might also see Edward and Sophie on the balcony and Prince of San as well for that moment, which is the kind of core team of working world. We'll then at other occasions see where all of the kids come in, so Zara Phillips, Mike Tyndall, we'll probably see Prince George as well and sort of the wider family. Now, we suspect that Harry and Megan may appear as well at that point, but then there is a real question over whether or not Prince Andrew does appear at any of this. There was huge controversy when he broke what had been agreed the rules a few weeks ago when there was a service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral for his late father, the Duke of Edinburgh. He had escorted the Queen in a car from Windsor into central London, was meant to leave her at the door, and she was going to walk up the aisle of the cathedral with the bishop that was officiating that. But instead, he walked her all the way up, and that was seen as hugely controversial, him trying to put a foot back into the front line of the royal family. There was a lot of criticism, and even some criticism of the Queen, which is incredibly rare, given her age, that he was abusing or being allowed to kind of abuse his place as favourite child privately to try and win himself back into some kind of public role, public favour. But that is very clearly not what the British public want. There is a lot of controversy still over the fact that he did pay to end all of those legal troubles. Indeed. Thank you very much. Vincent McAvaney, our correspondent there in London ending the program for the day. Have a good one, New Zealand. Yeah, by to Ro. A corkaw. A corkaw."}
