So my name is Ali Hughes from Core Education. It's my pleasure today to introduce you to Dee and Furry. So I just want to make certain that you are in the right session just in case you've been sitting here and suddenly realised you're on the wrong floor. I know it's really easy in Sky City to get muddled with the floors. So as I say it's my pleasure to introduce Dee and Furry. Despite their young age they have both have what's described as a long and diverse career in supporting Maori education. They're well known both in Maori community and in Maori education sector for the work that they've done in curriculum development, in resource development, in policy, and improving practice in Maori education. For core core education we're very proud to say that they are actually archa hōeo Māori are Maori leaders within the company and they work with us and our staff and work not only in the Maori medium sector but our work in improving educational outcomes for Maori in English medium so enjoy their session I'm sure you'll learn a lot educational outcomes for Māori in English medium. So enjoy their session. I'm sure you'll learn a lot. Thank you, Ellie. Tena, Tena, kowana, thank you, I'm coming here on the reaukara. We're here, we're going to meet to them, the pae maunga on Tamaki, Macauauau, and they're manakitang in on us. to them. We're going to be pae maunga on Tamaki, Macauauau, and they're in the top of the country of the world, some of the people who may come here after this will be coming in the of the the co-papap and the top of the way, and the tauta-to-the-a- tauter, the capo-tapo of the way. And the ticcana the it's a tawong, a tanifah, or any of the tapu-tapu. But in the words that have been in these days, now, this, we've got to the pae of these tapu, we're, we're here, our children, maur, maurie, mokopuna, ma'anamah, paehae, ahhawk where, to waiihae to these tapu. There's no longer the kutu. Tangle, TENKUUr TENKUrata, thank you all to all. All right, all I am myrault myatt myatt myatt myatt all right to come to come to and the awe on the cae my ta' ta' ta'a thank you My cae ma'amauarae. T'aonguea waiiata, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very, Fari. Thank you, Ely. It's always a little bit nice to know who you're talking to when they start talking. And so I'd just like to take a minute to show you that that's me. That beautiful place that we have a million just like it here in New Zealand. And if we have any from any of you in the audience today from overseas, welcome to New Zealand and welcome to my home. I think I'm going to be one of those ones that John Key can't call brain drain because I'm never leaving home. If you had a home, it looked like that, would you ever leave it? I'm a little East Coast girl. From a wee place that to me is the centre of the universe, to everybody else you can't even find it on your GPS. And it's called Puranga Ho. Porangau is out the east coast from Waipukau. And apart from my mother, my three aunties, a handful of cousins, 10 other people go there for their summer holidays and that's where we come from. However, I live in Palmerston North. So if you say to me, we're home, it's out there. That we place there that the rock that you're looking at is called Parikawao. And at the other end of the beach is another one called Pari Omahu. And they're significant features to us because they're the boundaries between Nāti Keri, my hapu, and a neighbouring hapoo, and into the Tamatea Heritanga area. My background has always been in education. My parents were teachers, both of them. My mum's Māori, that's her home too, my dad's Pākeh. I was extremely lucky to have parents that supported and encouraged education. Because like many others in this room, and I heard Kevin Honeycutt talk about it yesterday education wasn't necessarily a good deal for many of our people and I was one of those not a very good deal ones I was one of those still-dead school certificate as a seventh former the lucky side of that was that I got to be a seventh former and why because my dad was a deputy principal at the high school I got to be a seventh former. And why? Because my dad was a deputy principal at the high school I went to and my mother was the PE Geography Teacher. So between the two of those people, both strocky bag as they were after sea, pushed, pushed, pushed, encouraged, congratulated eventually, but encouraged and that's what we need to do. That's one of the key things that we need to get to in the work that we're doing around our priority learners is to bring families back on board with their children's learners. I'm going to leave it for that now and let Farie show you his little pimple that he calls a mountain. He's a west coaster. But I'll let him talk about his own home. Tena, kwe, Tama, Waihine. And they're my pippo. Yeah, Taranaki, born and bred. And so I think we sort of compliment each other, you know, the Taha Wahina side and the Taha Tanea side. If you're a west coast, do you know that Taha Tanea side, that west coast side. Pretty handy for the surfing, which is one of the features of Taranaki Mauna. But I'm raised in South Taranaki in a big family, within a very Catholic, Māori so I had this really Catholic, this real Catholic upbringing, but my folks, particularly my father, nothing PC about my father. He was very black and white about his expectations. And I think it's really wrapped off on us in terms of work ethic and and expectations and I and as classroom teachers I think expectations around our tamariki whether they're Māori or whoever is within your room given Honeycutt's comments about expectations I thought this morning were pretty spot on but however I, I was one of the first in my family, six, to go off to university, mainly because I heard they had really good parties. So I went off to Waiqatakao University, and they were right. So I had it all of the time there, but also managed to get through a secondary teaching degree. But I had a couple of very huge influences of Waikato University, particularly through the Māori department and where I got turned on to Dereo Māori. And, you know, when I was at Tamariki in South Taranaki in the 1970s, Doreal Maury wasn't that sexy. But of course, we went through that real crazy renaissance period and Tehrel and being a kaiakur and what a great time it was to be brought through. And then along the way we started to get introduced to new tools and that's really what we're here to talk about some of these new tools and how we can use those new tools to complement some of the work we're doing. Now we've we chose that title, He Taunga, He Tanifa, because we are finding in the work we do that some of our Kāāāā are treating them a little bit like Tanifah and steering a little bit away from that space and possibly limiting opportunities for our own Tamariki. So that's my background, proudly involved with the core team, with Ellie and the team, and please that you're here to hear at this particular workshop, but here at the ULUN workshop 2012. So anytime you're in Taranaki Maunga, I'm a Pariaka boy, so I have, my mum was raised at Pari Haka, so I have a my mum was raised at Parihaka. So I have a little bit of that rangi Māori aside to me sometimes when it's required. But we'll talk a little bit about that as we go through the presentation. I want you to just take a look at this. The I don't know A lot of it. I don't know A manuobu A man who and I'm a man who and I'm a man who a man and say I'm going to and I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to be a man who want to me. I'm not here I, and I know I, and I'm going to gore, and so you're going to get, and I'm a lot of o'er. Oh, and so that's a good. Oh! Oh! So, you know, and then cuckoooo, yeah, yeah, and I'm a car be, and I'm going to be in the kutuzziahriah! I can't have for people, and I can't go ahead. Oh! You know, and I'm a man, so I'm going to go ahead and go ahead and sit-brunuched, we're in my rugby World Cup. It was all on. And I had the opportunity to be up here in Taumaki Makuro for the last three weeks, fully involved in a lot of the activities that surrounded the rugby world cup. And just as we sort of move into this technology, that flash mob stuff that just went viral, went viral around the world. Showcasing, it's all good, it's fine, this is my tick girl, very handy, very handy these core people. That just showcasing handy these core people. That just showcasing us as a people. And, you know, a real good example. And I know you guys are all familiar on the social media sites, on the Facebooks, and all those sorts of things and what our kids are doing. But this is just an example of the flash mob. It started at Sylvia Park in Auckland. And then when it came into that particular that last shot was in Auckland City there on the lights I think they had 25 seconds or whatever it is to walk across the pedestrian crossing to do that that flash mob haka and then it just went viral around Aotearoa and then it ended up in this place. I'm gonna Get mehurt! I'm gonna! You're gonna! You're gonna! I'm gonna! The United States! The United States! The United States! Chirangina and Noggi! Chalach and you know me! Call for a call, call you, call you, call you call for a minute the people and people, cuckoo, cuckoo, buta, man, Any other people who are any kidding where that was? Spain? Spain.? Spain. Spain. Civil, Spain. About a week later. So it's just, you know, we've all got lots of examples of how the social media is pushing our culture out of Valtiero. I mean, some very interesting haka stances, I thought. Very interesting. But, you know, sometimes we, as Māori, we can sort of get a bit precious about our taonga and those things that are important to us. But, you know, what a way to sort of really showcase and talk about. Not only us as Māori, but us of the peoples of Aotearoa, New Zealand. I think the all-blacks do a pretty mean haka these days, showing a lot of pride and a lot of what, you know, we can debate a little bit about us, but what social media is doing in terms of our culture and how it's going around the world and how we are, our tamariki are already doing things that are a little bit ahead of some of the things we may be doing as classroom teachers. So that's just a bit of a pointer. We're just going to take the back a little bit and talk about communications over distance in a traditional sense. The other thing I think that those HACA slides reiterate for me is a common saying that's been around the country for years really and it's internationally hot locally not internationally hot locally not most certainly the power of technology to get the international flavour has bought Māori culture into another realm globally but we also have the power power, and I say this to you teachers, that rests in your hands to change the way that New Zealand's future generations interact with each other. And if we have something here in New Zealand and those children in your schools that's wanted all the way around the world, then let's pick it up and run with it. Because it comes back on all of us as a nation, as a culture, and a way ahead for our children here in Aaltero. This morning we'd like to take you on a way bit of a backward journey, because we do that, we go backwards to go forwards. Tetero Fokomua, to ha'a'ha'i forkamure, which in itself is backwards and forwards, because we have two words that are interchangeable in Māori, mua and muri, one that means backwards and the next day it means forwards, and in another context it means forwards, but actually you think you're talking about backwards. And what's that all about? It's because time goes round and round and round and round and round and round. And backwards and forwards and time coexist with each other. At a recent presentation, when we talked about taking this journey back into time, somebody through tweet said, well, that was a waste of time. What do we need to know what happened in the past? We need to know what happened in the past because we need to learn to that. We need to learn from both our mistakes and our successes so that we can make the best judgments as we go forward. When our ancestors first arrived over a period of seven hundred years to this beautiful country of ours, they found an environment that was, to put it lightly, extremely challenging. They came from the warm, warm Pacific to a country whose seasons change frequently. We've seen that just in the last few days here in Auckland, from running across the road with a book on my head to keep my hair dry, to taking my jersey off. And so what they did, of course, was that they used anything that they could find in the natural environment in order to survive. Survival was the ultimate aim. Food, shelter, travel, and what we're here to talk about today, communication. A very, very common instrument that they developed was by the use of the conch shells. And there were two in particular. Those of you that were at the Poohiri on Tuesday morning would have had the pleasure of both hearing and seeing a very long instrument like this that we call the Poutaata. The other one is this one here. I beg your pardon, the long one's the Pukaya, this is the Putaara. What these conchels do attach to their rakao is that they communicate sound across long distances because we couldn't ring up and we couldn't text and we couldn't Skype. But an iwi in the north and an iwi in the south had their own systems of communicating. And one of them was this. That sound that you heard on Tuesday morning travelled from hilltop to hilltop to hilltop. And there were many there were many many many different ways of communicating sound it was all audio at this point in time because they'd settled for a wee while before they got to the next so lots of ways of communicating traditionally. We're just suggesting that we don't forget that we had our methods of technology, traditional methods of technology. And maunga, partly the talking mountains. Where we went to the tops of hills and lit fires and you know and today we tend to the poets to put a flag in the ground and say nocute the fenua this is my piece of dirt and Taranaki Maunga a very clever tuppuna of mine is called Tahu Rangi. Interesting name Tahurangi he climbed up Taranaki Maunga, and this way of proclaiming that mountain was to light a fire. And it signalled to everybody within view of that fire, and Ihau. So, you know, we had our ways of communicating, and those are the things we shouldn't forget. Now the runners, the runners in the day, and those are the things we shouldn't forget. Now the runners, the runners in the day, we were probably as good as those Kenyan runners, I reckon. Those traditional trails of sending messages. They were important people in our traditional times, the runners, the ones that took messengers on behalf of our rangatira from tribe to tribe. It wasn't the technology that we understand, that took messengers on behalf of our rangatira from tribe to tribe. It wasn't the technology that we understand, but the messages and the conversations were similar. These talked about the Pukaya and the Pultatara, and even the Kowow, you know, those ta'aunga wakata ghi, there's a little bit more, you know, those co-wawawo's a little bit more, henea, and tutankai, those romantic, you know, gets all the romantic juices flowing when you listen to that kawau, but it has a story, it has a message. Of course, the seaways were our highways. We didn't have the main roads. Now, koreiroeroa manu, the tui, tui, tui, tui, tui, tuia. The birds that pulled us together as a people, and it's portrayed in our caranga, in our waiata, in our faikorero. We use that analogy a lot of the tui that is joining us together and we believe that those sorts of elements are still relevant in the online space manu ote you know those those amazing kite old kites that had a little bit more of a wai-wa about them as they as they dipped and dived with a winds of taffiri Mati and told different messages, spiritual messages. And those are the ways that we could. Some of the ways that we communicated in many ways, of course, but those are some of the ways that we should not forget because the way we communicate and how we communicate is really a part of the message that we want to share today. And so, listening to both Jason and Kevin this morning, you know, I learnt a new word. What was the, uh, etiquette? Netiquet. And an ane, ane, our own tukanga, uara, tikanga. You know, our own relationships and values that we, that we should be maintaining. And, you know, I loved what Kevin talked about, teaching our kids about some of those protocols so that they know how to behave appropriately online. Our values, our values are the same. Manehākita. How do we manaki each other online? You know, aki-aki the mana of the tamaiite. And, you know, to encourage each other to uplift each other's mana. How can we be doing that when, you know, we send those sort of real intense texts and Facebook comments? So those are the sorts of things we're here to share to you today because I heard it. I heard the message. It was in a different language. But those ticanga of ours, those who are what are those values of ours are relevant as they were traditionally. Aki-a-a-ki-a-i-to-a-man of the tangata. And you can't do that by sending messages that, facka-it the tanga. Tick, you know, we still, when we get online, those of you that are familiar with online, work with your online communities, your VLNs and webinars and all those sorts of things, we still caratia, we still mehi. You know, you might be up in Oangaree and I might be down in Taranaki but we still have to fakotau that wairua because, you know, I've probably had a domestic with my wife and tried to get the kids out of the house and all those sorts of things. So you need that caragia just like we are here, just like we did today, just like we did this morning, to fakatau that wairua. So those are important aspects, the tikanga, the wairoa, you know, you can hear it online when there's the conversation starts to get a little bit tense and sometimes we have issues but dealing with those issues in a real honest and full of integrity. And I think those are the sorts of elements that we need to maintain in an online environment um cano he kikaa can't have lovely kofanao i've got a lovely kofano i meet all of them first online all All of them. They're based all over the country. Great. We've got a beautiful wailo in our company. But what was really important to me was that when we got to do that face-to-face stuff. As much as we live online, you can never, never take away the importance of having that. You know, eyeball to eyeball, Kanohi Kitea, going to those important wanganga, those important hui, our tribal hui, our tangihanga, and all those sorts of things are as important. I went to a tangihanga in Taranaki, a kai-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-haura. Her sister passed away, and we went to her tangihanga at Nalmarae there in Kete-marai and Ha-a-kura. Her sister passed away. We went to her Tunga at Nalanga at Nauru Marai there and Kete Marai and Ha-wara. And I was up there all ready to do my flash me. This girl I met to school with, she passed away just in her late 40s. And next minute, there's this iPad in my face. And I could see this cousin of mine and he was sitting in Perth he was sitting in Perth and you know he couldn't make it back to his cousin's tangy so you know that's what's happening with it and you know what don't want to know he did I was quite comfortable because at least he was partaking in some of the Corridor but there's still the point is he can't heitita you know let's not ever take ourselves away from that importance to us as as as people really not just Māori but as people in a similar sort of vein earlier on this year they very well-respected Reverend Hone Kaa passed away and his Tangihanga he was buried the coast, his tangihanga was streamed out to the world. And the feedback that came through that of people that had been able to connect because they couldn't be there, that khanohi kita is an important one. And sometimes that khanohi means a a canoie online but when it happens physically at home you know you can have all this crying and sobbing and grieving going on but at the same time you've got all the queer's eyes wandering around to see who's there and who's not there and believe you me they remember they know if you were there they was also know given time if you were there online these as we carry on down our journey through history these things are stable Tikanga changes as language changes over time but the thinking and the processes behind these things are stable. There's another one called Mahitahi and Mahitahi means working together being together it's related to Manakitanga it's about looking after other people it's about looking after yourself and it's about I guess nurturing and holding close what you believe in. When you mahi tahi you have a responsibility to another person or another group of people. And the last one we brought up here and put it particularly in this screen because it's one that a few years ago I think the Ministry of Ed picked it up as a word for reciprocity, ACO. And yes, it is a word for reciprocity, because learning is reciprocal. But there's an awful lot more that goes with this cup ACO. That's also that we need to retain when we talk about ACO as a principle of learning. For example, ACO happened between grandparents and mokopuna, frequently, regularly, more often than it did between grandparents and their children. Why? Because they were out there in the bush cutting down trees so they could travel around, who nurtured the children. And so Aco crosses generations it crosses time the fariwananga out in the bush went 24-7 it didn't start at 9 o'clock and finish at 3 o'clock and it didn't respond to the call of the toi or the ringing of the bell so when we talk about Aku in a classroom sense as well, those are the things that we need to remember. And the final one for this screen that's really, really important is what I call the building blocks of Māori society. Every document I've seen in the last five years, education, health, justice, they talk about engaging with Fanao, hapoo and it's in NZC, it's in the Marautanga. It's here and it's there and you hear our minister talking about all the time. When I first heard that I thought, holy shimori, that's a big task and a big ask because if this is me then this thing that we call Fanao are in fact how we function as a people and so we need to get as teachers that we need to get a handle on what that looks like it's a matter of putting a block on top of another block on top of another block until you get a wall that grows into something else I've chosen to show it to you in a different way too this is the story of my granddaughter now she's eight years old she she lives in Palmerstown North and she goes to a school that's just 100 yards down, 100 meters down the road from where I live, and that's home. So she comes and goes with her two, with a little brother and with a cousin. And I just want to show you what, from her perspective, Fano looks like, because she wants to open her blog to her Fanao, but she's been restricted to opening her blog. She's been asked by her teacher to let mum and dad and nanny, because this nanny fronts up at school quite frequently, as you can imagine. Here's my wee girl. Kiyahra. I'm Maya Raukuraara. I'm Maya Rokura Thomas. I'm Nelly Nine and I live in Palmer, North. This is my brother Jake. He's five. He's pain actually. He's just started school. And I've got a wee sister tea. We call her sally. Actually you know, Nanny calls her Missy. Nanny, she calls me Missy as well. Actually, she calls my mum Missy too. And my mum, she calls Sally Missy. I reckon it's because they can't remember our real names. These two over here, I don't know them very well, they're my older brother and sister. And they were my dad's kids, and he had them before he knew my mum and they got married. But we see them, but they don't live by us. This is mum and dad. Actually I was telling them they're not really married but they're getting married in January. And this is my nanny and my kukul. And they live in Palmerston North too. And after school we all go down to their place because mum and dad go to work and even if nanny's not home, we know how to get in the house and we just make our own afternoon tea and that's my nani and koku. And this, these two, they're really special. This is my nanny nanny and my koro. Now that sounds like a funny name to you I bet. But I've got a nanny so my other nannies alive too. So we just called her nanny nanny. In fact I got a grandma and her mother's still alive so we called her grandma grandma grandma. This is my auntie Jennifer. She's not actually my auntie Jennifer. She's not actually my aunt we called her grandma-grandma. This is my Auntie Jennifer. She's not actually my Auntie Jennifer. She's my nanny sister. And this is my Uncle David, and he's my nanny's brother, and he looks in Lampia too. Auntie Jennifer, she's got three kids. So I suppose they're sort of like my cousins but they're heaps older than me so I just call little them it's Auntie Lily and that's Uncle Peter and that's Uncle Age there and they've all got kids of their own too I've got about four or five cousins over on on from Auntie Jennifer but my uncle David he um he hasn't got lots of kids yeah I can't remember how he's sound he hasn't got lots of kids. Yeah, I can't remember how he's here. He hasn't got lots of kids and we don't see them as often or we still too. Now these four over here, you know, they was telling you about my other brother and sister that I don't live with very much and I don't see very often because, you know, well these are their kids. They're really cool. Actually, one day I remember my teacher asked me how many cousins I had. Well, I don't know. They're all just cousins. Now, my granddaughter is just a normal, run-of-the-mill, everyday child that comes from a mixed heritage. Nobody is a cousin. They're all cousins. This is my cousin over here. It's also my brother over here. This is my best friend over here. This is my work colleague over here. The message I'm trying to tell you here is let's not put people in boxes and let's not presume that the way that we grew up is the same way that children grow up and the same experiences that they have. So you get that Fano of Myers for together for example and that's her Farno. Remember we started this by saying and we're asking you to engage with Fano through your school activities and then you put Aunt Jennifer's Fano next to it and then you put Auntie Lillie's Fano next to it and then you put Uncle Peter with Fano through your school activities. And then you put Aunt Jennifer's Fano next to it, and then you put Auntie Lili's Fano next to it, and then you put Uncle Peter's Fano next to it, and then you put Uncle Fari's Fano next to it, and you build a hapoo. But this is just the hapoo that I belong to. And so you put a hapoo together, and a hapoo together, and a hapoo together, and you build an iwi. And before you put a hapoo together and a hapoo together and a hapoo together and you build an iwi. And before you know it, you're looking at thousands and thousands of people. Now let me ask you again, how you're going to engage with all of that? And the answer is actually really simple before we carry on down in our historical journal. You engage with your fauna. Maya's fauna might have had 30 people in it, but in that fauna there are key ones. Her parents, her brothers and sisters, any of the other siblings, they are up the same school, but don't, let me tell you, don't ever forget nanny and don't ever forget auntie because this nanny and this aunties takes more little tippy hideys down to that school than those parents ever did. To go back to communication I love this photo because it tells a million stories the role of the Wahini the role a million stories. The role of the wahini, the role of the female, has always been the first role. It's always been the carrier of the first sounds. The voice that opens the world. The voice that invokes the taha wairua. And so the audio, and we know this, this is obvious. You know, speech was and continues to be a major way of communication. Apart from the sounds that we talked around through Pukai and Putatara, this of course was the obvious one. This sort of communication, and yes it is technology I believe, this sort of communication of course carries on to today. So we have a female role supported by a male role. What do Kevin say, but males need boundaries. Not me. Yeah, you know, again, the importance of Karanga, that ancestral voice that's just passed through the generations and communicated. They communicate the message of welcome, of those that have passed on, and their ancestral way, that is still very irrelevant today. I'm my matua, my papa, Huirangi, is still with us. The importance of Waikorero, within boundaries. Not at all. But the carrying of the message on behalf of the iwi that is still relevant today. So those forms of communication bundled up with all of those values that we mentioned earlier are things that we carry on into the age of the online technologies of today. I just want to share this little, the importance of Weaata and Haka. Let me look at this one. The President, M. Oh, my Godoomar, Oh, my God, I'm gonna'erite, we're gonna'er, black out of the matthew, why ask you, war, and I'm gonna'amara and I'm gonna'er and a man, and I'm gonna get that Ii'i'i'i'i'i' Oh, Pohmah, Pothmara, Pank'ar, F'ammer, POMAWROWS BAKERC! POMA! Bhopuraka! Woha! Wohmara! Ohpah! Ohpah! Oh myrata!... Bhopalana! Bhopalya! Oh, Kone! Rack Pohmala, and Korni and Olai! and Oleg! HECMptas! That's all right to be in a man to bea That little chap there on the far right, my ten-year-old son, quite impressed with his little Haka style. But that, if you listened, if you captured some of the words, you would have heard words like Waiapulchoro, Ibuhrangi, Pukamata, Facebook. And then Haka was composed just this year because they had some issues at their school around the online bullying stuff. And so they composed this haka in a very traditional way about looking after manaki tangata, making sure that they looked after each other and challenged each other through the composition of a haka. A couple of stories to tell off that slide. One is that haka and chant and those sorts of things still communicate important messages. You go to Matatini and Rotorua. Doesn't pay to be a minister of anything, particularly a minister within parliament, because all those issues that are relevant today, how we use the online communities in terms of learning haka and learning chant and learning waiata, but at the end of the day the best way to convey your message is that cano he kite our way is by learning way and haka as a collective and performing it in a way of here. It's captured there on image but there's nothing like having it in your face. We had an interesting little poohidi actually, I must make that little point of with our American visitors the other day that got challenged. The Nātifatu, a warrior came down the aisle and my Kevin Honeycutt's boss, Mike, was sent out to receive the Raka and he's a pretty solid dude and the knees started to shake. He didn't understand much about the ceremony, we didn't explain it, wasn't the intention but he got it. He got it. He felt it. And words didn't have to convey the message that was being portrayed here. You know, you're in my tooth and make sure you behave yourself. And I think those sorts of messages are still relevant. Can't he get it. How we portray that stuff online. You know, I want to come, I'm going to chuck a few fukataque at us at different times. He manateau tecou. You know, we have, we're beautiful orators. We have beautiful carakia, beautiful carakia. We know we talk about values, I know in NZC and a lot of the charters and the graduate profile work that we've done over the years. I've seen some of our own values, Māori values, becoming part of your school charters, particularly menarchitanga and aroha, but how do we play those things out? And same with this, you know, this little fakataque, he manatea te kupu, you know, it's no use having things written in a document as you aren't going to personify them, portray them, play them out, and how do we play them out within our school communities. These earlier comment, you know, I think those slides of Farno, and I've been hearing a lot about student and kai'ako. Within the Māori settings, and in fact not just the Māori settings it's that community. How do we grow that online accessibility presence not only within the school and for that child but with their faunao? My mara, Pariakaka's got a pretty cool Facebook page now. So it's all good at where we're arguing. The second part we wanted to talk about was just briefly as a visual communication. You know, we have the Fai-Kuo, the Moko, the Kofai, the Taniko, the Raranga, all those visual communications of narratives of stories. You know, I'm a Taranaki boy. I know all about how Taranaki arrived on the West Coast, but it's a very Taranaki-centric version where Tangaro was the cheated us out of Pianga. True, eh? You guys all agree with my story, eh? The people of Tongaero might have a different version, but I'm sticking to my version. Because Tongariru and Taranaki had that fight over Pianga. So they captured in our stories, in our carvings, in our core-fi patterns, all those narratives that are still important. And how we, you know, we see lots of these images. There's beautiful Khorero in that, forkaido. Howanga, Kordero in that, forkaido. Here hangar, gaudo. So we're moving it a little bit forward into the arrival of the new technology within the mid-1980s, the arrival of the Pakeha, and their technologies and how we embraced the written word very early on. And of course it was through that, ani, there was only one book in Māori Hose for the first 50 years and it was the Bible. And we embraced that very early in the very early in the 1800. So our Tuponah saw the mana of the kupu Tuhi. They saw the value of the written word. And of course, through Karakia, through hymns, through prayers. We learned to read and write. And we learned to engage with a new culture and a new technology because we saw value in that. So the embracing of the technologies today is no different. Our people at times are very innovative, quick to see value in other technologies that may have been quite foreign, and that's why when we treat some of these tapu tapu as Tanifatari, Ehara. And of course we started to transfer our knowledge. I've talked about wayata. This is a wayata that was written in, it's a Parihaka wayata. And it's one of those wayata that's like a lot of our wayata. We started to write them down. Waka Papa, our genealogy, we started, they have become clearly part of our sort of written record of this sort of knowledge. But what's really important to a lot of this wayata is that we actually continue to these weata. And we continue to orally present our waka papa and that we don't just leave it in this online space as stuff that we store away as an archive and that's what I'm here that I'ma here hear hear hear hear from here konga kinae kiroi o pariakana, O'rae, wakae, ere, my ticcang i, tere, by, ay, to be a t'et Poo-T T'gat, I hear of what I'ma, where I'ma a-o-e-a-a-a-a-a-a-i. I'ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- the Aukkawaru wakamomutu Ayuwanah There are Urue Ake te Tonga Kāāāāāāāāāāā Aai Aai A The point of the exercises Let's not leave our Weiata as written documents That is stored away and say, Yeah, I know that weata I've got it sorted. That particular wayata talks about the troops coming onto Parihaka in 1881. So it's got quite a different rangi and it basically is the rangy of the troops marching onto Pariaka. And that's the rang. So unless we teach our kids the weata and the Koreiro, and yes, send it by an MP4 or MP3 or whatever it is, as a sound bite, send it, but let make sure that our tamariqi know the history of those we're ways as well. And those are the sorts of things. We're encouraging us to do as Kāakao. Use the technologies, but make sure that that kanohi'i pita, ta'ringa, wakarong,ai'aqo. Use the technologies but make sure that that cano he pita, taa, wakaronga, waha'i'ena, hakaina, in these of our huthangata. And so the arrival of Europeans to New Zealand, as we know, wasn't all fun and games for any of us. Not for your Tupuna and not for my Tupuna. But there were some taunga that were picked up and run with. After a period of time when our people learned to read and write, no, let me go back a step, your ancestors learn to read and write? No, let me go back a step. Your ancestors learn to read and write in Māori and speak in Māori first. For a period there there was much more, continued to be much more Māori language spoken in New Zealand than English language. As the people got together, as they sorted out their issues, as they battled for the land that the language they did that was in Wistero Māori the written word the opening of schools policy of government all those sort of things eventually as you know meant the English language took over round about this period I've got my glasses on so I can't see what that date is right about this period we I've got my glasses on so I can't see what that date is, right about this period we had the Education Act and of course the first of the state government schools. So prior to that we had native schools and native schools were, they were interesting in themselves really and there's a whole period recorded on the internet that you can read about them. They were pretty much an effort by government to work towards faster and more efficient assimilation of Māori children into Western society. So the deal was, were to the iwi, the hapu and the Fano. You put up the land, you put up the building, we'll put a teacher in it and let's pop out a whole new generation of New Zealanders. Let's put it very, very briefly. What this did, this British syllabus, after the closure of most of the native schools, was that it designed a one model fits all. And the idea around here, of course, and it's an old idea, and we no longer do this, is that you have a square box and you open the door on one side and you file all the kids out and a few years later you open the door on the other side and you file the kids out the other way and they all look, sound, feel the same. We know and all of us in this room are still grappling with the fact that back actually didn't work because the ministry have prioritised three groups of children, Māori Pacific Island and children with special learning needs that actually don't fit the system and you know I reckon there's a lot more children out there besides those three priority groups that don't fit the system and I'm absolutely delighted to be able to be standing here in front of you today because you are the people you're the biggest change agents this country has the biggest change agents this country has and I think it's marvellous. You know, we can stand here and talk to the cows come home, really, but change in this country rests in your hands, each and every one of you, and I thank you for that. There was a well respected gentleman of his time, so Apeira Nata, and he was a Gnati Paro man. And he was a parliamentarian. As he watched history develop over his lifetime, I guess these are the words that he was remembered for on his passing. He was talking about the relationship between two cultures, and he was talking about, initially he said to our people, take what they've got, you need it, forget the old stuff, get on with the new, new way of life. But later on in his life he said this. Mautoringa to the taunga the Pākea, but your gaito, to the Atua, none of these all. Put your hand on the technology of our new neighbours. Keep your heart up there where it belongs because at the end of the day he makes the calls. Sir Apirangata. Wonderful man. And that's the same today actually. If I look at the way I behave in my community as a 21st century nanny, with all those mokos that I showed you on the screen made me, that's the way I behave today. I want to be able to do and know and see and engage in and explore everything that every other New Zealand does. But my gharākā, because he will make the final cause. And that atua, of course, comes in many different shapes and forms, speaks many different languages and must actually be transgender because he is a she, where I come from. And so then, you know, we started rushing through the different technologies in the 60s, in the 60s and the 70s, and I've focused on this because this is the period that I remember. Born in 1958, my life was crazy, but nowhere near as crazy as the life of our kids at the moment. 1862, Telegraph, Christchurch to Littleton. The first telegraph line in New Zealand. Christchurch to Littland, I suppose something about that big on the map. By 1881, there were 27 subscribers to that telegraph line. 27 subscribers. I wonder how many tweets went out in Kevin Honeycutt session this morning. Huge comparisons. By 1913 we had the automated exchange of telegrams that looked something like this. Telegrams were still around when I was young. Mum used to send telegrams to Nan to tell her that the kids were on the bus and they were arriving in a few hours time she didn't ring this generation of as Kevin talked about this morning too about the party lines is our first form of audio conferencing and those could well be my aunties because most of them did their adult years, their working lives before they got married as young women, and the telephone exchanges. I must be considerably older than many of you. Those telephones, again, and I remember this one. We called it the party line. Hey Nicole, have you been down the par yet? Nah, I've been busy getting dresses ready. Yeah, that cousin of ours got us all busy on the wedding of the century. Yeah, I'll say all the boys out diving, getting wood for the hangy, and me been hard out on the dresses, and you hear all Auntie Morainui, she's been baking the wedding cake. Mean. Yeah, it's been full on, all right. Have you seen him hear me? Nah, oh, uncle was looking for him. Yeah, he was looking for him too. He's supposed to be getting the stones for the hangi. Hey, hey, I think he might have a new girlfriend. Yeah, I think he might be right. I saw him at the pub last night and he was not alone. Ah, are you kidding, Janelle? Is that you? Are you listening to our Kordero? Get off the line now. Far out, Janelle. Isn't there any privacy these days? I was just listening. I wasn't doing any harm. Well, you would, well, you just want to mind your own business and get off our line. I reckon, no wonder I want to get out of this little town. Man, keep your knickers on. Anyway, do you want to know who he was with? Oh, hell yes. Yeah, the party line. Can you not, can you, is people that remember the party line around you? Thank you. Thank you for being brave and putting your hands up. I do remember it in rural Taranaki and you know a little it was sort of suited us as as Māori and rural you know I mean we quit at the Kordera, he we hadi Kordero. You know we were great at telling stories and embellishing stories. I gave you a little example of the mountain story this morning, but I, you know, if anything that's happened over the last couple of days listening to these presenters, haven't they been great storytellers? Telling personal stories and applying those stories to real education settings and context and things that we can relate to, different language, different twang toang, but the same, the same messages. And the storytelling, I love some of the digital storytelling that's going on amongst our kids. But you know that, sitting around the fire, sitting in the Ferekai, in the Fere Nui, and telling the stories in that way as well are part of what we need to be grasping hold of with our tamariki. Being able to tell the stories of our, of their rivers and their lakes and their mountains. Those stories we cannot lose them and being told not just online but in a real way. Ehoama, quite a teethe of our fukharata yeah for sure use those tools but let's not forget that we told stories and yet as I say I think we embellished them a little bit and there's nothing like a good storyteller. And then we got introduced to that. He remembers in 1960s. The first television in the house. And, you know, I mean, I was very young. It was about five years old, but I can all remember us sort of walking out the house and going down to the neighbours. And we all sat there and we watched, you know, Lassie, Mr Ed, which has made a reappearance on Māori TV now. The Real Māori, Mr Ed, that's interesting. You know, some of the programs, you know, Bananza and all those sorts of programs. And it was almost like a communal thing. You know, some of the programs, Bonanza and all those sorts of programs, and it was almost like a communal thing. And of course in the 1970s, same color TV appeared. The good thing about the 60s in that early time, we didn't have to fight over the remote, did we? And we all became really staunch Coronation Street followers that was the only soap opera going but you know it changed it started to change the lifestyle that we live and now taking you know sometimes in a good way sometimes and not such a good way the brick I don't normally get hang up on television but I have to tell you that the famous people that I knew in my lifetime I remember two who when they passed away I cried one of them was Prince Tuiteka and it was because his music just got to me, but it was also because I'd done so much work with introducing his music to my children in school. The other one was Anna Sharples. I haven't told many people that, but I remember her. She was wonderful. When Fari and I were at Masi, as Māori advisors, at Massey in those days there was one car between 20 advisors and there was one brick, the very first of the early cell phones. And Mr. My Boy thing, but the boys took it out all the time and the girls could have a book it. And it was just as well because it was ten times heavier and 10 times bigger than my present laptop case. It was enormous. And we could be standing on opposite sides of the streets in Wanganui, for example, trying to have a conversation on this great big thing like this and not hear each other. They weren't terribly successful, but they were the beginning. I was also teaching at that time in Palmerstown North when these very early computers came into school. And Kevin asked it this morning, who do you remember? I thought, oh I've got that on my slide. From what I remember of it, we called it an Apple 2E. It had a green screen. I don't remember anything clever like a mouse or anything like that. You weren't, the children were not allowed to touch it. It had a lifespan of about 30 minutes only every day when the teacher was allowed to turn it on. So it was almost like you turn it on, the kids all gather around, you look at your green screen, and then you turn it off and you go back to do. And that was probably advanced, as advanced as computer technology got when I was in the classroom. And then we saved anything that we did manage to do on that great big floppy thing. I also remember the first time I decided that I needed to get on board with this technology stuff that everybody was talking about that was pretty scary. And I went down to the local computer shop and was trying to tell the man what it was that I wanted to purchase. And I guess it must have been exactly the same as the story when the woman goes to buy a new car and the salesman asks her what sort of car does she want and she says the red one well i went down to buy my very first computer and he said to me what do you want and i said um well i'm a teacher so i need one of those ones that has big typing on it like this so that i could make stickers for the children's desks. It's a bit shameful really. All these new technologies did they find favour with Māori? Absolutely. Absolutely. Because they allowed us to keep in touch with each other, to stay connected. Do they still find favour with Māori? Absolutely. But I think as the technology advances the issues get a little bigger, the access gets a little harder and I'm still talking about Māori and I'm thinking about communities like the community that I call home, really. The downside, of course, of these early technologies, and I think perhaps that this contributes to the loss of the almost extinction of Tidel Māori, is that all these ways of communicating followed by the British syllabus that we talked about were monocultural, monolingual and added to the complexity of maintaining your own language in your own home. It was what happened at the time. There is no shame and blame in history anymore. What we need to do now is say, this is where we're up to, this is how we're going to move it on. And luckily for us, Tira Māori took, as you know, took a huge lift and revitalisation and is where it is now. Our people were very great at going tutu Far Far Ha'ah Haida. They used like to play with things. So the early 1990s 200, for me, they were infancy periods. They were periods that my grandchildren would laugh their head silly if they could see what I was attempting to do with my technology. I remember the day Fari and I first managed to get on email to each other from Taranaki to Palmerston North. It was easier and quicker, you're laughing, to get in the car and drive for three hours to tell them. The lessons that we had to have about where to put the plus sign when you're using a search engine. Actually, what the heck was a search engine? And so on and so forth. Today, of course, we have a whole lot more toys that connect us quickly, programs that connect us instantly. I can now talk to Mum. No, I can't because she's not online. I can talk to Faris' mum at the drop of a hat through all these sort of things and so these sort of programs we're saying to our people you go for it because it's through these sort of programs and applications that we can be ourselves as a people I can't tae'a te'a te'a te'rae, the koro, and I guess this fakotiki supports Fari's earlier one, he manateau te cupu. In the good old days, back in the day, the handshake was my word and was my honour. We shake hands on it, that's it, nobody goes back. The same in Māori custom, the word given, could not be taken back. If I say my Iwi's going to come and stand alongside your Iwi when we trash that Iwi over there, I couldn't go back on that. The ta'iaha can be parried, but the kippu cannot. And we stick with that and we need to encourage our children to do that too. Again, I said to Kevin after he came off the stage this morning I said, you know, most of your slides and your koreiro are what we wanted to talk about, but he's a bit flasher at doing it. What he was talking about and and what this reiterates, is helping our children to learn to make good decisions before they push the like or before they push the send button. I think many people in this room, and I certainly know that I have been caught out by that. You write something in the heat of the moment, often in anger, and then you push send and as soon as it leaves your screen you go, oh, once it's gone, it's gone. I was going to say to my shame, my grandchildren are better at this than me, but actually it's not to my shame at all. I asked her one day just recently, what's the internet darling? What is the internet? And she said, well, it's like this big system in the sky that you can't see, but it's always there. And then my next question was, so what would you do without the internet? And she said, I don't know, I suppose we'll die. Because for these culture, and of course there is no life without the internet doesn't exist. It's incomprehensible. And so I'm not sorry that I'm not shamed that she can do more than me. My role as a grandparent is to go through these with her and make sure that she knows what she's doing. What she's doing when she's on Facebook and she's not on Facebook, but what she is doing online, who she's messaging, she can ring me from my cell phone when I think my cell phones in my handbag. The amazing things that these kids can do. And I think too that really we have all these wonderful technologies but they are only as good as the way that the user engages with them. So you can get a koretaki old nanny like this one, and you can get a sharp, bright little button like this one, and the worlds are miles and miles apart. For me, when I get to the stage where it's just too hard, I just cannot work it out and I haven't got time to text Ellie because she's Googling over here and Skyping over here to somebody else, I give it up. And that's the bit that's Sue my shame. I do, I give it up. Do you know if anything happened to me today, I was sitting up here, I am sitting up in my room, attempting to put the finishing touches on this presentation for you, Luton. And the slide that I got up to that I was playing around with was talking about the effectiveness of technology is really only as good as the user who engages with that technology. And I think that we know as adults, if things don't work the way you think they should work or it's a little bit too complicated, then it's easy to give up and find an alternative, whereas the kids of course will persevere and persevere and persevere and persevere. What I was trying to do was take four movie clips from Philly's computer and put them into this powerpoint. Three have been transferred over really easily. The fourth one though, the file and then the transfer the file changed and it couldn't be read on my computer. I packed away his he fit and consequently as a result of that I can't show you that video clip it's proof and do you know sitting in this room in this conference with 2,000 people that are IT savvy and way up there and I was too embarrassed to go and ask anybody how to do it or if they could fix it for me but I'm not as bad as this. But I'm not as bad as this. I hope I'm not as bad as this. I've bought something from your last week and I'm very disappointed. Oh yeah, what's a problem? Yeah, well my blackberry is not working. What's about any run out of juice? Oh no, it's completely frozen. Oh yeah, I see that? I'll tell you what. Let's try it on orange. That's got a few black spots, you see. Oh dear, yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah. Well, now I do to get my blackberry working. Well, it could be an application issue. But where'd you stall that blackweed? Which on my desktop. Well, you could try using a mouse to drag the blackweed to the trash. And after you've done that, you might want to launch the blackweed to the trash. Then after you've done that, you might want to launch the blackbee from the desktop. Well, I've already tried that few times. I mean, all it did was mess up windows. Well, it might be worth... Thank you. I don't know how it's your don't know these things about these things, but my wife's about these things, but my wife's seen a few dougals in their time. And she says, it'll be on the small side. I'm afraid there's not a lot I can do, right? Tell you what, let me try boozing him. That he's crashed. Anything else like to come? Well, honey I'll get my grandson's birthday soon. Okay. Now, it's already got an apple and a battery. I mean, have you got anything else? He might be like, well, if you're doing an expensive offer on these, I mean, I can't make and or tailor them might be like, well, if you only expected off on these, I mean I can't make and tailor them for the keeps team like at Xbox. Exbox. There's a, there's some delightful little clips like that out in cyberspace about people and their funny experiences with IT. As we all know, many of us, particularly those of us in rural communities, are anxiously awaiting ultra-fast broadband. For my wee community, over there by that, by Parikawa that I showed you, there's still a dial-up. And much of the community doesn't engage because it's a community without money really. Of my 210 relations over there, I guess 209 of them are unemployed. And so the idea of ultra-fast broadband to our school is so, so exciting. Part of my responsibility as a good member of that Farno, that hapoo, of that school support system and hopefully a friend with the ministry is finding a way where we can open that to the member of that fauna, of that hapoo, of that school support system. And hopefully a friend with the ministry is finding a way where we can open that to the community by allowing access for the community into the schools. But we'll see, that's another story and it's a bit of a watch that space on that story. Ultra fast broadband will connect our people. If we can make it do what we need it to do. The other part of that we coastal community is that they don't actually get what everybody else gets. They're last on the list, by the way. When I first asked my colleague Douglas, where does the school fit into the big picture plan of the rollout? He couldn't even find them on the list, which seems a bit unusual, because they're only half an hour at Wai Pooka-Doo. As it turns out, they're on the very last on the list, and they're going to get satellite instead. My aunties and my cousins don't know the difference between fibre and satellite and actually anything else to set dial-up and have a AC on the old party line. So they're excited, and that's a really good start. Connecting people and keeping communities connected is what we need to do. Do you want to come out? So the access, Dee's talked about the access and I think we're, particularly those of us that are, you know, in the rural areas but of course we had particularly those of us that are you know in the rural areas but of course we had a bit of an access problem here in the heart of Tamaki this week but our use of the hardware and the software and getting our people very familiar with those sorts of challenges but you know I think these made some good points today around us just not being afraid to ask and engage and use people that are close to us I think we were we were sort of on the downside in terms of time and preparing but it's interesting to see how some of these technologies have been used and some and how our tamariki can actually teach us in so many ways, our own tamareki within our own homes. I wanted to introduce you to this queer from a place called Or Maya down in Tecaha. And she's actually my mother-in-law, and she's actually a really, she's nothing about the mother-in-law that you can imagine. She's actually really cool, she's nothing like the mother-in-law that you can imagine. She's actually really cool. But check this out. With this modern technology, it's so good to be able to sleep and touch so to speak on the Skype and email. But in my opinion, that personal face-to to face match is so important. It's my idea. A nice little clip. She's just really impressed me. If you've ever been to Tikaha or mile, but about 60 odd case, east of Apotiki and Fakataania. She uses this, particularly she's become a crazy Skype. And so she's got, you know, like all of us, tamariki in relations all over the world, so suddenly she can just connect that whole franoangatang stuff. And, you know, she's starting to get familiar with Facebook. So she's really taking up that challenge and she really relies on her tamariki and her mokopuna. We wanted to talk about rangatiratanga and the ability, again, that technology provides us to sort of determine our own destinies here. Yeah, there's been issues in terms of our access and all those sorts of things in the past and I like what Kevin said earlier about making sure that the tools don't manage us, we manage the tools, that we, if we can facilitate good language programs using our tools. I've got these three beautiful women that played out the party line role play a bit earlier. Very efficient. We're running Fokapikereo. Language enhancement programs, blended e-learning programs online. These are all sorts of ways that we can really initiate some great work using the tools. But I'm going to bring Diat to talk a little bit more about this Arrata. If you've ever heard Derek Winmouth speak, and Derek is a very dear colleague of ours, he talks about three, I've never heard him principles, but for me they're principles. He talks about ubiquity, connectiveness, and, oh goodness makes one out of my mind. And the other that has totally gone out of my head and given me a blank moment as underpinning the way that we use technologies and so ubiquity and rangatiratanga to me are the same thing. This word here is a word that got bandied around in the radical days, if you like. Tino, Rangatiratanga, Māori reclaiming their land, their rights, they're this, they're that, and it got a bit ugly. For some people it's still a little bit ugly, but rangatiratanga is self-determination. Self-determination is being able to make good choices because I have good choices, because I can make choices. If I have in my heart, you know, when I'm thinking about what Apirrana Gata said, if I have in my heart that, if I have on the other side of my heart wherever that is the values that Māori, whole dear that my parents have instilled in me, I have rangatiratanga. I can make those choices through e-technologies. Why? Because I can choose from anywhere in the world at any time, which is Apo, at any place, at any space, and with anybody else that I like or I want to be engaged with. Can you hear that? It's very fun. And I named Seth on the line, but I'm doing the school where I mean the club and what they're favorite for me, what kind of sports do you at, and how they get to be a candidate, and how to be able to be there. And I love my sport but really, and I like to watch the highlight, it's very important to see my favourite players, and I think we've been 14 times out and then what's your other mind. We asked a little bit like this little fellow, this is our little fellow, this is Awanui, we asked Awanui, tell us a little bit about what being online and online learning means to you. And he didn't. He told us about what drives him as a young man. He told us about what he loves to do. There's a real challenge out there, isn't there? If that's what drives Awanui solely, that in breakfast by the way, drives him, how do we use what we know about him, the tools that we have access to, the world that we have access to, to up the motivation level there. Because he's a delightful little boy this one and he's been raised in his Māori values. He knows this is the way we're supposed to do things, this is how I respect my elders, this is how, but he also knows that this is how rugby and sports work, it actually that's what's more. How do you pull together the two with the big E plus in the middle so that in five years time when we came back the same boy, he's talking a different language, he's talking a different talk. I don't believe that anything is impossible in the world that we're all operating in now. I know it's not, nothing's impossible. If you take that with the idea of this 24-7 learning space, which doesn't mean that the teacher has to be in there, by the way, because the teacher's role has changed. The teacher's role is changing so jolly fast. I don't know how you guys keep up with it, to be quite honest. We're no longer teaching the children what to know, what to learn. Now we're teaching the children how to learn, how to access, how to find it out. And that's a big shift. I couldn't go back to the classroom anymore because the skills that our children, these 21st century learners that we have, the skills that they need are no longer the skills that I have. And that's a bit scary for me. I just have to hope that it keeps me going for a wee bit longer. I'm going to hand this one out to Fadi because this is exciting. This is something that you can't do online. Yeah, no, I had to throw that one actually. You know, I still think we've got to get our kids out into the elements and to places that are close. That's like on my beach about a week ago. Orcas, a pot of Orcas came, flating through as we were surfing. That's not me, I'm a little bit to the right of that guy, but we've got a visit from Orcas. And the whole point of the story is, you know, the online stuff's good. It's important. But let's not stop taking our Tamariqa into the real situations. So then the whole world, the whole world isn't just an online world. But that was pretty cool. What a day? Spiritual. One of that, you know, if we go away with anything today, and I know we're starting to sort of move on time, I want you to just think about the values, the real need to ensure that those values are played out and as our Tamariki and we ourselves work on the online space. That connection, that Fanoongatanga, that community, that Fano around our schools are really important, those sorts of things. And I'm just going to... Do you want to talk to that? things and I'm just gonna like do you want to talk to me which is really really pulling out the fire this is an illustration a diagram that I did a we while ago for a different reason but it's about connecting families it's about the power of what we can do when we all get connected through you FBs and I we put it up there today because I want you to think outside the square box of what we can do when we all get connected through UFBs and we put it up there today because I want you to think outside the square box of what a network could possibly look like because there's a bunch of people out there that know a heap load of stuff about the children that sit in front of you every day. You know a heap load of stuff about those same children. Those two groups of people with that child have got to come together. They've got to come together. And the potential of learning networks, electronically connected, is really huge for Māori communities. The potential of Māori communities getting left behind, once we get all this flash fast technology, is also very huge if we get it wrong. If you have a close look at that diagram, right in the centre is our child. In the right place, where they should always be, at the centre of their thinking around learning and engagement. The four words in the first circle, engagement, participation, decision making and collaboration. You'll notice that there's no consultation in there. I'm a huge believer that consultation went out with the Dark Ages. That engagement with Māori families is what you need to be aiming for. Engagement means that at some stage we're going to get married. When we get married, we're probably going to get into bed together. Oh, some of us might have done that before. It doesn't matter which order you do it in. Consultation means you ask them what you want, what they want, and then you go off and do something else often. Engagement means you hold hands, joint partners. In the third outside ring, there are a few ideas about what could be driving this engagement. Graduate profiles, localised curriculum, participation with Iwi and hapoo, and leadership. And all four of those are drivers in New Zealand's curriculum today. Localised curriculum is a big one. We have here in New Zealand, it's like I said an hour ago, we have here in New Zealand something that nobody else in the world has. And our kids have a right. Every single child in New Zealand has a right to know all of that. And on the outside circle, who should be in a network? Fanao, remember my as big Fanao, the kura, the school, connect to the marai, a huge source of information and knowledge, to the hapahu and iwi, to the community that are not traditionally engaged in learning through school, and of course to our students themselves. This is the very last one that we want to show you today. This week, girl, this is Maya and her big family, her little family, and she talks about everything we've talked about really. No, she doesn't. I don't have to Facebook because I'm too yadmy and my mum said no and if I did someone might put some in the appropriate stuff that I shouldn't see on there and then like I'll do, I'll say that wouldn't like when it won't be very good and yeah just thank you for me hope so thank you for me oh and here my and there are my thank you for coming in and sharing this bit of time with us. We still believe the values, the for knowingatangata, but let's go and attack that online community. T'nokotau. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Kura, well, I think one of the things that's really struck me over the last two days is that powerful message about the personal journey that we're all on. And we heard right from yesterday morning with Jason right through about how important that journey that we've had is in our teaching and remembering the journey that our children are on. I think one of the things that Deane Ferie did looking back and looking forward was reminded us of those principles and values that underpin who we are and what we do and we need to think about how we're going to use those in this new online environment that we have. And then I think they left us with a powerful challenge that we have all these new tools etc but actually we as teachers and educators out there have the power the way that they put it the power to change the way our children interact for the future so that's a challenge for you for the future and so we have a week for them which I've left down on the seat but I just want to ask you once again to thank them for the presentation."}
