Right, four minutes away from 6 o'clock. What are we going to talk about? Well, big day for supermarkets, really? Well, is it? This is the thing, is it? Because I want to know from people at home, who do you blame for cost of everything's going up? And the National Party says it's going up and the National Party says it's the government and the government says it's Russia and the supermarkets and everyone's kind of blaming each other. So I'm really interested to hear from our audience this morning. Who do you guys blame for the cost of living going up for your groceries, your petrol, whatever it might be? Do you sit around and blame anybody for it? Or are you more just worried about how you're going to pay for it all? I'd love to hear your answer to that question this morning. Feedback at amshow.co.n.z. And with all the changes that have been announced in terms of the supermarkets and a crackdown on competition, this was after a Commerce Commission report, the government has announced its response to that. What do you need in your pocket to actually make an impact? Does a couple of dollars a week cut it in terms of actually helping with your cost of living? Or are we talking big money? Are we going to like an extra hundred bucks a week? Or is that not even big money? You need to win lotto to get groceries these days. It's that bad. Do you know, I did some rough numbers, and this is dangerous, isn't it, when I do rough numbers? Oh, yeah. Fingers and toes come out. Yeah, but remember the last time I did maths on ear, and it was really embarrassing? So when you do numbers, it's probably bad, but when you do rough numbers, that really rings alarm bells. You'll take. So, $1 million in excess profits per day. This is what the government says the supermarkets are creaming in, right? A million bucks a day in excess. So that means like over and above what they should be. I mean, who decides that anyway? Whatever, this is what they said, million bucks a day. So times that by seven, seven million dollars a week. Am I right? That's okay, so we've got a week sorted now. All right. Five million Kiwis. Yep. It's $1.40 per Kiwi per week. So if the government does everything they say they will do and they increase competition in the supermarket sector and we're all getting behind it and all of the big chains are competing and prices are coming down. The best we will do is a dollar 40 a week per person. If you're a couple with four kids that's if it's a dollar 50 per person $9 a week. Something like that. I won't agree to that specifically. I've taken it a little bit further dangerously. But you know what I'm saying? At best you get a dollar 40 a week. Really? Is that going to change your life? Is that going to change your world? Is that going to get you an extra spread of butter on the toast? Probably that's all it will get you. I'm questioning your maths because that just seems staggering. I can't believe that we've got to the stage that we actually need. We've been talking about it for two years, how unaffordable groceries are, that we need a regulatory process to actually iron this out. I think that's the farcical part. All right. We've got more on this coming up this morning. Yeah, let us know what you think. Feedback at aemshow.co.n. Our supermarket duopoly has been put on notice by the government to change at pace or face regulation. Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson is with us at 740.

Police Commissioner Andrew Costa is with us at 7.10. And our immigration policymaking is being accused of having a black box approach when it comes to transparency. More on this in 10 minutes right now. News time. Talulva, good morning. It's 6 o'clock. Desinda Adirn's America trip has hit yet another obstacle following COVID cases in the delegation, the Defence Force plane they've been travelling on his broken down. News hard political reporter Amelia Wade is with the PM and sent this update from Washington, D.C. There's been another episode in this series of dramas of the Prime Minister's trip around the United States. The Defence Force plane that was meant to take the delegation and the Prime Minister from Washington, D.C. After her White House meetings and back to San Francisco, that plane has now broken down, leaving everyone scrambling to book commercial flights. The Prime Minister was meant to take a commercial flight from San Francisco back to New Zealand, but we'll have to fly commercial both ways. This comes after a very nervous 24 hours, after two of Jacinda Arden's top advisers tested positive for COVID and had to be left in San Francisco to isolate. Diplomats here scrambled to get a last-minute PCR test on the ground. Jacinda Ardern says that while it is disappointing for the two who couldn't make it to Washington, D.C., the trip is able to continue as planned. Protocols were in place and preparation in place for at any time the delegation to be COVID affected. And that's because, of course, the world is still dealing with COVID. And you will have seen that through this trip. There are still, of course, mask use in place in many places. A lot of testing required throughout this trip. And so it's something we've been prepared for. There's now just one more test at the White House to pass. Tonga is the next target for a group from China that has been sowing up deals with nations right across the Pacific. China was hoping to secure a region-wide economic deal with multiple Pacific countries, but several island nations have expressed concern. The delegation signed an agreement with leaders from Fiji on Monday following meetings with Samoa and an earlier deal with the Solomon Islands. have expressed concern. The delegation signed an agreement with leaders from Fiji on Monday, following meetings with Samoa and an earlier deal with the Solomon Islands. But Pacific reporter Edward Kavanaugh told AM early, some Pacific Islands don't want to get caught in the geopolitical crossfire. Some are very concerned about the region becoming a thesis for geopolitical contests between the United States and between China. So despite the fact there were a few of these deals that have been signed, there is a bit of reluctance in the region about deepening ties with China. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has downplayed the seriousness of these meetings, saying that China being in the Pacific is nothing new. And I think we do need to just take a step back and remember that, of course, China has been present in the Pacific and active in the Pacific and across infrastructure projects and built relationships over a number of years. What is happening right now is not new. Perhaps the pace has picked up and the engagement has picked up, but it is not new. The World Health Organization is reassuring world leaders' monkeypox is unlikely to become a global pandemic. At least 250 cases have been detected across 23 countries where the virus is not already endemic. In total, nearly 70 people have died from the virus in Africa alone since mid-December. Two smallpox spokesman Lewis says says while the numbers are distressing, they're not accelerating. We are not concerned of a global pandemic. However, we are, and that word would need to be defined in the context of an orthopox virus. We are concerned that individuals may acquire this infection through high-risk exposure if they don't have the information they need to protect themselves. A handful of countries have begun offering vaccines to close contacts of confirmed cases as a precaution. InSport, a home final remains within touching distance for the central pulse after a hard-fought 51-43 victory over the tactics. Kelly Jury continued her red-hot form as she produced another big defensive display to keep the pulse in the match. But it was Captain Tiana Mituoro's 85% success rate under the hoop that guided them home after some nervy moments in the second half. It was tight, it was a grind, and I think it may have taken us a little bit by a surprise but at the same time we kind of expected it because it was their last game. But no, it was super tight and I think I'm just proud that we managed to get ourselves out of that yucky feeling in that sort of tight situation. The victory was the Pulse's ninth of the year as they moved to the top of the A&Z Premiership table overtaking the Northern Mystics. The Black Cap squad has been reduced to 15 players ahead of the upcoming three test series against England. Wellington all-rounder Michael Bracewell will act as 16th man for the first test starting at Lords on Thursday. Bracewell is covering for Henry Nichols who's in doubt as he continues to recover from a calf injury. Yeah, at the moment we think it's unlikely that Henry will play. Obviously with the COVID, that just put him back another week or so from where we were wanting. But he is progressing really well. I think at the moment he's an unlikely starter. In an act of protest, the creme de la creme of the art world has been smeared with creme. The Mona Lisa has been defaced in a growing up swell of climate change campaigning across France. The perpetrator was a man disguised as an elderly woman before jumping out of a wheelchair to spread cream across the glass casing. Footage shows the protester yelling as he was evicted. The painting is undamaged. The same can't be said about the planet. He's got a point. That's very late. can't be said about the planet. He's got a point. That's very late. Don't condone it though. That's the ladies from News Hub 6-bast six. It looks to me like it was very much not the intention to damage the Mona Lisa because of course it has got the glass casing but knowing that putting cream on there or doing something to the casing would get a headline because it is the Mona Lisa. What I'm not sure about is why dress up like an elderly woman in a wheelchair? Because they look defenceless so you wouldn't suspect. So you can get to the front. Yeah and that no one would suspect that they are going to do something untoward. You said an elderly woman in a wheelchair. You think harmless. I guess so because you're also carrying a cream cake. You're not thinking of eco-terrorist. Why cream? Why not, you know, chocolate sauce? I don't know. I can't speak to the culinary choices. But I can tell you that an elderly woman in a wheelchair looks harmless. Holding a cream cake, because, yeah, although any other person holding a cream cake in the Louvre would be a little suspect. The cream cake would not be safe with me. There'd be nothing left. Hang on. Actually, that is a good point. Was she holding the cream cake? Or was it under the... Was it under the dress? We need to dig deeper into this way. But on a serious point, on a serious note, all of the climate, you know, it's not terrorism, is it? It's just annoyance that's going on protest. At some point, they might say, well, we're not going to let people near these beautiful artworks anymore. No, we won't let you go up the Eiffel Tower in case you're bungee off it with a parachute that says Greenpeace. You know? What did Mona Lisa ever do to him? What did Mona Lisa? Granny. Yeah. You know? It's Mona, not Rona. She did nothing to you. Mona might be a climate activist herself. We don't know. Again, some of questions. She probably upset the elderly woman by staring at her. Yeah. Don't look at me like that. Those eyes that follow you, no way you go. I have a theory that it's actually not a painting. There's just one of the security guards, it's their job every day. They put their eyes in there and they stare at everyone. You know? Climb into the back of the painting. Let's take a look at the weather now. Yes, please, let's. The weather brought to you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. Heavy rainfall and it's some tropical, lowbring weather warnings and watches for today. Heavy rain watches also in place for Bay Plenty and Northern Gisbon, Tasman, western Walthwaika and Western Fjordland, you have a strong wind watch in place. Let's have a look at the Lower South. Can expect a fine day with high cloud across the region. Othipote Dunedin, 19 degrees. Queenstown 16. To the West Coast, rain, possibly heavy in thundry, easing to showers by the afternoon. Milford Sound 16. Hooker ticket 17. Canterbury and Marlborough, it'll be fine and warm on a mostly cloudy day Christchurch or Otahee 20 degrees. Nelson 17. To the lower north, it'll be cloudy with possible showers. Winds will be strong and exposed places. Wellington 17, Masterton at 19, and to the central plateau. A mixed bag, a few shafts for most of the region. Are possible thunderstorms even hail this morning for New Plymouth, Wanganui on 20 degrees. Topor, a lot, call her on 16. To the east coast, any rain should clear by the morning to a cloudy day with light winds. Gisbon on 20 degrees, Rotorua 17. Thanks very much. And to the top of the country, don't steal my thunder. You can exceed a cloudy day with isolated showers. There'll be morning fog for Keri-Ki-Ki-Roa and thunderstorms for Fungare, Tamaki Makaro, Okilani, Auckland and Samoan, and Friang, 20 degrees. Now you can go. Thank you very much, Bernadine. Right, 10 minutes after 6. Now, the Productivity Commission wants our country's, quote, black box immigration policymaking to be more transparent. It's this morning released a number of recommendations as part of its final report called Immigration, Fit for the Future. Productivity Commission Chair, Dr Ganeshana is with us this morning. Mordena, good morning. What do you mean this black box of secrecy? Hi-a-hi-a. I want to say it's secrecy. It's just ad hoc. And what we want transparent is how the immigration decisions are connected to the other decisions of government around, for example, workforce training and skills development and the provision of facilities and investment in our infrastructure. All of those things need to come together. And at the moment, it seems like immigration policy is set in isolation to all of those. Okay. So you've got immigration policy being set. How many people can come into the country and get work visas, etc., in a silo, and it's got no relationship to how many workers we actually need, what types of work we need, the houses we have available, infrastructure, that kind of thing. Is that what you're saying? It's that kind of thing, and very much those signals should be made over the long term, so businesses and communities can plan on that basis. And that would be very helpful in terms of not only lifting our productivity, but also the well-being of all New Zealanders, including the migrants. Do we need a cross-party, you know, on some issues, like now with climate change, how all political parties basically are on board with the same singing from the same song sheet? Do we need a similar approach to immigration for certainty? It would help a lot, absolutely. I think the immigration has been a, I suppose it's been a political football for too long. And what that encourages is short-term behaviour in short-term settings, and that doesn't help. What we find is immigration has been very good for New Zealand. Migrants have contributed positively to both productivity and the creation of jobs. But what we need is that longer-term certainty so that not only can we do the investment in the infrastructure and other stuff, but we can do that over the long-term and not only help New Zealanders, but also migrants in terms of their connections to New Zealand and feel connected and contribute even more. True. Well, New Zealand First is no longer in the scene, so there's that volatility taken out of the equation, I suppose. Ganesh, I wanted to ask you about another issue, and that is this idea that we need more migrants to fill the gaps that we have now, because obviously, you know, after COVID, very tight labour market. Do we need more migrants, or can we train up people in New Zealand who currently might not be working? What's your view on that? Well, it's got to be a bit of both, and I think that's what it always has been throughout New Zealand's history, at least since the treaty. And because New Zealanders have always gone offshore. And so we've, and that's the OE, and we're not going to stop that. And so we've always needed some migrants, I suppose, to fill that gap, but also add even more in terms of being connected to other parts of the world, bringing in new ideas, bringing in new knowledge, creating new business, all of those sorts of things. And I think that's where we need to head. It's not a question of migrants or New Zealanders. It's a question of both. And so that's why we mean by connecting our migration decisions to our workforce development and skills training decisions. So we've got to put the investment in that area as well. Right. One other thing that's come up on this show a number of times from both employers and from workers is the tying a migrant worker to a particular employer. No one seems to like it, particularly not at a time like this. You say get rid of it. Absolutely. If migrants are going to deliver the productivity that we're after they need to move to jobs where they're more productive and feel better, used and valued. If employers are looking after their workers, they won't be concerned about that level of competition. Migrants should not be tied to a single worker. Once they come into New Zealand, they should be treated like all New Zealanders and be able to move and move around if they so wish. That will help not only them, but all of us as well. Even to a field of work which they didn't originally come here with the intention of performing? Well, that depends on the visa that are on. If they are on a visa that limits them to a particular industry, then that should be made clear and that's part of that transparent decision-making process. So not only the migrants know, but also businesses know how to plan, but we'd prefer migrants to be flexible because that's how we not only get them in the most productive use, but also enable them to remain in the country, contribute for your connected and deliver well-being to all of us. And get the better ones too, right? Hey, Yombe, thank you very much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Chair of the Productivity Commission, Dr. Ganesh Nana at quarter past six. Dr. Nana raises a really important point, I think, that it's not fair on migrants. If we bring them here and we don't have a plan that is communicated clearly to everybody about what we're going to do in terms of giving them the social support, the infrastructure support, because what we've seen in the past is where you have an influx of migrants to fill jobs, fill skills gaps, it then becomes this kind of animosity towards them as a blame game for problems with housing and problems with other infrastructure. It's not their fault. There just wasn't a plan. So it's really important that it is transparent. We should put that on their rival card. New Zealand government's terrible with infrastructure. Just so you know. Housing, good luck. Traffic. Do you like traffic? You know, everyone thinks New Zealand there'll just be them in a sheep, a paddock full of sheep. It's actually not like that, you know? We should be a little more honest. Be open about what's going to happen. It is lovely too. Of course, you know, and there'll be a job for you for sure. We want you to come. Please do. Feedback at amshow.com.n.com.m.com.m.com. Change is on the horizon as the government moves to break up the supermarket duopoly.

I'm now just eating one meal a day. It's usually just cheap food. Good luck saving for anything for my retirement. That will be enjoyable, won't it? Oh, Steve. Sorry, Steve. Thanks very much for writing in. And I'm sure there are unfortunately a lot of people also in your position. It's really terrible way. Part of the reason they say, supermarkets. Yeah, which we are now talking about. New Zealand's supermarket duopoly is on notice. The government's accepted 12 of the Commerce Commission's recommendations and is taking a hardest stance with the other two, but will it be enough to deliver real relief for our cost of living crisis? Thanks to our partners at Milford, I'm joined by independent economist Cameron Baggery. Cameron, good morning to you. Steve, who has just written into us on one meal a day, when do you expect after this response from the government to the Commerce Commission recommendations, when do you expect Steve will get real difference on his supermarket prices? Well, let's be blatantly clear. Yesterday's announcement is no magic bullet which is suddenly going to go see supermarket prices falling rapidly over the next sort of six to 12 months. Supermarkets like a whole lot of other industries out there are facing rapidly rising costs and probably the best they can do in the current environment is to try to contain price increases as to push prices down. But if you step back and look at the bigger picture, what did the government really signal strongly and clearly yesterday that they've got a very strong desire, emphasis on the word strong, to get more competitive pressure into the certain market industry. Now, economics 101 is that yet more competitive price. Consumers are going to be the winners at the end of the day. The big story here is that how long does that journey take before we get that more competitive pressures on the table? We know with telecom, it took an awful long time, but consumers have been the winner at the end of the day in regard to that. We're going to end up, I think, with a similar result in regard to supermarkets. It's just taking a bit of time. They stopped short of forced investments, basically selling off some of the duopoly stores to other retailers. Wouldn't that have made a huge difference in the short term? Yes, potentially. I guess if you look at where we've been in the past sort of 12 months, the Commerce Commission came out with their initial recommendation, and they stated the basic problem. We've got an issue here where there is a market structure issue. What does that mean? Well, there's two few blokes. There's not enough competition. So what's the solution? The solution is about actually providing a footprint for more market players. Now, with it in their final report, they stepped shy away of sort of divestment, and they came up with the blueprint of a whole lot of other recommendations, but stopped short of the real nuclear option. You know, what we're seeing from the government yesterday is that the nuclear option is on the table. Now, the ball is now in both supermarkets and Embes' Court to sort of chart a path to the future. You know, if I was at MBE out there at the moment, because this is a really important piece of work. You know, they need to get some skilled people with private sector experience in there to try to navigate where we're going to be over the next six to 12 months. I'll give you an example of what goes on within the likes of MB. MB's got a big team of about 60 people that will go up to SMEs. Small to medium-sized enterprises. Big issue for smaller to medium-sized enterprises is access to credit. Does MB have anybody within that 60-person team that has actually had experience working in a lending institution? The answer is no. They've got a lot of policy people. So, yeah, MB needs to gear up and get the right people in the right places to help navigate that piece of work because it is a really important piece of work. And it could take a while by the sounds of things. In terms of those two big players being able to make wholesale products available to other retailers, what they have said previously is that then reduces the efficiencies that they are able to put in place in producing that. So eventually the consumer will wear that cost anyway. Is that legit? Does that sound like that would be the case? No, I think that's a little bit of, yeah, let's look over here, whereas look at once again, economics 101. If you've got more players in a sector, then surely going to get more competition. You're saying the reverse just makes absolutely no economic sense. And the important thing here is because there's going to be a little bit of games and ship that goes on. Because you've got a couple of pretty big entities that are going to want to protect their position. Yeah, what we want to see is more competition and more competition of scale. It's the importance of getting scale providers into the market that is going to benefit middle to low income New Zealanders. Yeah, we don't want a situation where, say, the big two,, have got 40% and then you've got a whole lot of market players that have got 1% each, so say 20 of those. What is that going to be? That will be a model that's basically serving the upper end, the boutique end of time of town in regard to specialised product. You want to make a real big difference for those sort of people on the ground in regard to their supermarket bills. You've got to get providers of scale that have got a decent footprint out there across New Zealand. Independent economist Cameron Baggery. Cameron, thanks for your time this morning.

Welcome back to AM. It's now news time. To Lava Lava, good morning at 6.30. There's been another episode in the series of dramas in the Prime Minister's America trip. Following COVID cases in the delegation, the Defence Force plane they've been travelling on has broken down. Dessandra Adirn was already intending on flying home commercially, but it means another change of plans for the rest of the group. Use how political reporter Amelia Wade is with the Prime Minister and sent this update from Washington, D.C. This comes after a very nervous 24 hours after two of Jacinda Ardern's top advisors tested positive for COVID and had to be left in San Francisco to isolate. Diplomats here scrambled to get a last-minute PCR test on the ground. Jacinda Ardurn says that while it is disappointing for the two who couldn't make it to Washington, D.C., the trip is able to continue as planned. Protocols were in place and preparation in place for at any time the delegation to be COVID-affected. And that's because, of course, the world is still dealing with COVID. And you will have seen that through this trip. There are still, of course, mask use in place in many places. A lot of testing required throughout this trip. And so it's something we've been prepared for. There's now just one more test at the White House to pass. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has downplayed the seriousness of China's current presence in the Pacific, saying it isn't new. It comes as China has signed deals with Fiji, Samoa, Nui and the Solomon Islands and hopes to secure a region-wide economic deal. While some Pacific nations are saying they don't want to get caught in that geopolitical crossfire, Adirn says she isn't worried. And I think we do need to just take a step back and remember that, of course, China has been present in the Pacific and active in the Pacific and across infrastructure projects and built relationships over a number of years. What is happening right now is not new. Perhaps the pace has picked up and the engagement has picked up, but it is not new. It's understood the Pacific will be one of the main topics of discussion when Adirn meets with Joe Biden tomorrow morning. Cry Steward's police have responded to the reports of gunfire overnight. Two people have been arrested. After gons, gunshots were heard outside the turf and one good horsebar and restaurant just after 9.30 on Monday evening. Despite 11 police units being called to the Parklands address, no injuries have been reported. Investigations are continuing. There's hope immigration New Zealand will improve its processes following a report released this morning. The Productivity Watchdog has made 24 recommendations to the agency wanting to see improvement on the quality and transparency of long-term immigration policies. Commission Chair Ganeshana says short-term fixes aren't the solution. Immigration has been very good for New Zealand. Migrants have contributed positively to both productivity and the creation of jobs. But what we need is that longer-term certainty. In sport, Black Caps veteran bowler, Trent Bolt, is unlikely to take part in the opening test against England. Bolt who played in the Indian Premier League final yesterday only just arrived in London, putting him in serious start for the tested lords. The Black Caps confirmed their 15-man squad for the upcoming three test series, with the addition of Michael Brakesville as a 16th man. Braggsville will act as cover for Henry Nichols, who's in doubt as he continues his recovery from a calf injury. Fourth seed, Stefano Tsitsapas, has been bundled out of the French Open after losing to teenager, Olga Rune. Sitsapas became the highest ranked player in the men's draw to be sent packing as he was punished for a lacklustre display. The match wasn't without some fireworks with both players getting into a heated exchange over a ball that was called in before the umpai intervened and proved the Greek wrong. Rune, who had never won a Grand Slam match a week ago, dropped only one set as he became the first Danish man to reach the quarterfinals. That's the very latest from News Hub. It is 26 to 7. Thanks very much, Bernardine. We're talking supermarket prices this morning and this big push by the government to increase competition, get your prices at the supermarket down. Though if you do the mass on it, based on how much extra profit they think the supermarkets are making, if we split that extra bit, the mass on it, based on how much extra profit they think the supermarkets are making, if we split that extra bit, the cream on the top of the supermarket's coffee, between everyone in New Zealand, you'd get a dollar 40 each a week. A drop, a drop of cream. Not much. Mark says, I blame the supermarkets. Of course, there are many factors contributing to this rind. However, when the country is under pressure, supermarkets appear to pass on extra costs to the people instead of taking a hit themselves. Yeah, because we asked, who do you blame for the cost of living crisis and the price of our goods at supermarkets? Donna says, I don't waste my time trying to blame anyone for the increase in cost of living. Blaming is not going to find a solution. I'd rather put my energy into finding ways to live more frugally. To be honest, I think it's a whole lot of things that have got us here. I'm pretty much what is it is, and what it is person, just suck it up and get on with it. I kind of like that attitude from Donham. Yeah, but also, Ryan, you know, we talk about living more frugally, which, you know, but what about that earlier email, Steve, who's literally doing a meal a day, how do Ryan we talk about living more frugally which you know but what about that earlier email Steve who's literally doing a meal a day how do you tell him to live more frugally so I do accept what she's saying we need to find better ways but that is not the answer well you don't want to say to Steve you're on one meal a day suck it up yeah do you we shouldn't have to live like that it's not good enough no no it's not usually it's if you're on a fixed income this period of time is very, very difficult because you can't do anything about it. You can't work more hours, you know, if you're a pensioner or whatever. Very difficult. Anyway, your email is feedback at aimshow.com. NZ. It's 25 minutes now away from 7.

And, oh, sorry, waste management, just to go over some safety around rubbish trucks, but also wanted to make mention to, if anybody knows a guy from Fielding that used to have a big white, clear bag, used to pick up all the rubbish for, like, years. I remember him. If anybody knows in the Manuatu, mighty Manuatu, who that guy was, I think he was a big contributor to fielding, winning, like, the most beautiful town in New Zealand like 20 times. But, yeah, I'm going to be checking out all the rubbish bins, just making sure I'm going to be doing all the mahi. I've got the wee by here. I was too early in the morning. Oh, no, you're going to wake people up. Yeah, we're all going. So if you've got any questions, let us know, and we'll be asking Neville this morning. Yeah, thanks very much, William. I do have questions, actually, about how the rubbish trucks were. Turn that off. William, seriously, it's 6.38 in the morning, and there are people sleeping. We want them to wake up and watch. All right, William. We'll be back with you later on. So he's going to get on a rubbish truck. I'm fascinated by rubbish trucks. Do you always want to know what's inside? Yes.

And do they deliberately knock your bin over if they don't like you? I'm always picking my bin up and thinking, look, I've got a list, rubbish truck questions. Yes. What time are they allowed to start operating? Can they operate different hours in a commercial area? What's in the back? What's the weirdest thing you've found? What's the, annoys you most as, you know, picking up the things? What's to, you know, is it overfilled bins? What happens when there's a car in the way? You see the truck coming and there's like 10 cars, but they're never going to get to that. So many questions. So many questions. Anyway, all of them answered later in the show. After the break, though, questions over Vladimir Putin's health. Is the Russian President seriously sick? Europe correspondent Lisa Raymer is with us after the break? And then...

Right, fraudulent tickets are being blamed for the chaos that unfolded at the Champions League final in France. Police pepper sprayed the huge crowd numbers trying to see the match on Saturday night, including some families. News Hub Europe correspondent, Leesette Rayameh has a report for us this morning. Leesette, good morning. What can you tell us about this? Yes, not a good day out at all for these sports fans who showed up expecting to see an incredible final between Liverpool and Real Madrid in Paris. What more could you want? They showed up and there were tens of thousands of people waiting outside trying to get in far more than the stadium fits. And this caused major delays. The stampede started, people started pushing and that's where the pepper spray and the tear gas started to be used. Now there's been a lot of questions asked about how things escalated to that point. But the French officials have come out and blamed the situation on industrial scale ticket fraud. So they're claiming that between 30 and 40,000 fans showed up with tickets that weren't correct. They were fraudulent tickets and they were either trying to get in knowingly or had been given these fake tickets. So that is how things escalated to that point where they had this huge number of people trying to get in knowingly or had been given these fake tickets. So that is how things escalated to that point where they had this huge number of people trying to get in the door and the staff at the gates were trying to ascertain who had a real one and who didn't. So very dramatic scenes, very unpleasant for the families that had been there and very reminiscent to a great tragedy of 1989 in Hillsborough where the Liverpool fans were in a similar situation with a massive stampede and close to 100 people died. So a very unpleasant weekend for these football fans and a lot of unanswered questions still. Yeah, we were just watching some of the images there, Lucet, and there are children look like they've got pepper spray in their eyes. Absolutely horrific. President Putin, who is apparently unwell, though not according to Sergei Lavrov. Yes, you may have heard these rumours swirling. They have absolutely been escalating, at least on this side of the world. Obviously, with the war going on in Ukraine, there's been a lot of talk about Vladimir Putin and a lot of attention on him. And with all that spotlight focused on him, people have been noticing that things have been strange in terms of how he's moving, perhaps not as agile as he once was, limping and hobbling a lot at the victory parade recently. People saying that he's put on a lot of weight around the face, perhaps suggesting he's using steroids. And the overwhelming narrative has been that he may have cancer. A lot of various, you know, high-level officials from his circle and around the world have said that they have intelligence that indicates he has blood cancer. However, it is completely unverified. And the foreign minister of Russia has now been forced to come out. And was asked about it and he said, no, any sane person can look at Vladimir Putin and see that he does not have cancer. So that's the first real acknowledgement we've had of any of these rumours, but they continue to swirl, obviously, because so much focus is on Russia and their president at the moment. Yeah, absolutely. A lot of focus on a very iconic painting, and this is in Paris, we go to the Mona Lisa. We've been talking about this this morning, Lisa. I know you're struggling to contain of laughter. Why do you think he dressed as a, dressed as an elderly woman in a wheelchair? This will make you laugh. What? Oh, no. Oh, no. You think the Mona as a, dressed as an elderly woman in a wheelchair. This will make you laugh. This will make you laugh. What? Oh no. Oh no. You think the Mona Lisa is funny. Look at this. This is what happens at Jubilee weekend, okay? So the Queen's 70 years on the throne and this man's clearly very excited about it. I'm not going to ask you any questions because I feel like that's asking for trouble. I was going to say... And you've had your, and you've had, I don't even, I don't even know what language was really his first language, but he's having a ball of a day of it in the rain. See, I think that's a missed opportunity. I wanted the, um, the hot exclusive with the drunk guy. Um, as he gone? Can we move? I'm not sure that would have been much of a scoop. What's he doing? Yes. Okay. He's just causing trouble. Not as much trouble. Not as much trouble as this man in Paris who has rolled up literally to the Mona Lisa at the museum in a wheelchair, in a wig with a bit of makeup on and he has started decorating the Mona Lisa at the museum in a wheelchair, in a wig, with a bit of makeup on, and he has started decorating the Mona Lisa in cake and screaming that the world needs to pay more attention to the planet and care for it more. Now, obviously, as you say, you've been talking about it this morning, but they've come out and they've said the way he was able to get that close to the painting was by being in a wheelchair, they've got special access for those with disabilities. So that if you've got a disability, you can get as close to the painting as possible and you don't miss out. So that's the reason for the wheelchair. I'm not sure why the wig and the makeup was involved. No. Maybe he's just into that. Lesette. Thanks so much for your time this morning.

It is 7 to 7. Thanks very much, Ryan. Jacinda Ardun will meet with US President Joe Biden in less than 24 hours. It's the most important meeting of the Prime Minister's US trip that's being plagued by her delegates being struck down by COVID for some analysis on the meeting, former Prime Minister, so John Key. Thank you very much for joining us this morning. What is actually achieved at these meetings? Practically in some sense, it's not a hell of a lot, but you build a relationship and rapport and get an opportunity to get to know the person a little bit better. One of the things what we're really lucky about these days is that New Zealand Prime Ministers go to APEC and East Asian Summit and in a non-COVID environment, that's when you actually probably get a lot more face time. I mean, that's how I got to know Barack Obama so well and why we end up playing golf. But there's no getting away from the fact that a visit to the White House for any Prime Minister, it's a big deal and it's important. Significant. But there's not getting away from the fact that a visit to the White House for any Prime Minister, it's a big deal and it's important. Significant. What's the protocol in terms of the topics that can be raised? Does this have to be discussed previously, or can you just raise what you want there? In theory, everything's choreographed to an inch of its life. So there's an agenda and you don't have a lot of time. You feel like you do, but in reality, by the time you get in there and get through the pleasantries and go through the agenda, and you'll have a few things that you want to tell the New Zealand media, you know, I hit these particular points of interest. So, yeah, I mean, you can stray. I mean, it's not like, you know, there's a rapport there. And, you know, Joe Biden, I met him a couple times when he was vice president once or twice, actually, in Washington, and then he obviously came to New Zealand. So he's a very hail fellow type of thing. He's a nice guy. It's not like he won't be able to talk about particular issues. But I'm sure when I hit those particular points around trade and the Pacific and things. Yeah, and no doubt gun control will come up because it's so very much focused on the news agenda there at the moment. When the Prime Minister was in Washington, D.C., she was kind of traipsed around the Senator's offices and used very much as a photo opportunity for them. Is it wise for the Prime Minister to engage in this kind of discussion with the President? Yeah, I mean, she can do, obviously. And, I mean, most New Zealanders, I think, would sit there and go, what a ridiculous set of laws and rules they've got in America where an 18-year-old can wander along and buy an assault rifle. I mean, yeah, I understand the Constitution and the right to bear arms. I think there was the right to bear a gun in case of grizzly bear came into your log cabin, not the right to take an AK-47 somewhere or an assault rifle. The problem you've got is, it's just not going to change in the United States. So if I was Joe Biden, you know, there's only so much, you know, she can talk to him and she can say things. And 66%, you know, two-thirds of the US public are actually on the fore the side of gun control or greater rules around guns. But nearly half of them have a gun. Guns are everywhere. And it's just not going to change. The US Supreme Court will strike down, I think, any overarching moves any US President made to try and control guns in America. If we can move on to a different topic now too, because we will have obviously a lot of analysis on this tomorrow. The Chinese foreign minister has been touring the Pacific in Fiji lately at the moment. Where do the relations between China and Pacific cross the line? Because it's not like any relationship is a bad relationship, right? But there's a line. Where is the line? Yeah, I mean, I think it's where the line is all about sort of total influence and control, I suppose. So, you know, the funny thing is I saw the Prime Minister basically saying that, you know, it's not new that China's been in the Pacific. She's actually right. They've been there a very long time. In fact, funnily enough, the bigger sort of thing was competition between Taiwan and in China, and the Pacific to a certain degree. When I was PM, they'd wandered around there and built lots of different buildings and most of them weren't terribly good or up to sort of a youth standard that would be beneficial for the Pacific. So we actually tried to convince the Chinese to partner up with us actually. We built, for instance, a water reticulation plant in the Cook Islands and things like that. So I think going off to China and saying, hey, don't be in the Pacific, that's a waste of time. So you think work with them? Yeah, I think that's one thing. I think the other thing you've got to make really clear, though, to the Pacific leaders, China's been giving soft loans in the Pacific for a long period of time. And I used to say the Pacific leaders, look, I can't tell you how to run your kind of country's balance sheet, if you're like, but I can tell you this much. If you borrow money they'll want to be repaid and we're not repaying for you because I don't think the New Zealand taxpayers should be sitting there saying if Samoa or Tong or anybody else wants to go and borrow money and do whatever they want with it, we're on the hook for that. But yeah look China's going to be there. They're going to be there forever the Americans have been worried for a very long period of time. What she won't get, I don't think, is the American saying, I'm going to be there. They're going to be there forever. The Americans have been worried for a very long period of time. What she won't get, I don't think, is the Americans saying, I'm going to do so much more in the Pacific. The Americans will say, quite simply, we have the whole world to worry about, by the way, you're sitting out there, you're in Australia, it's your backyard, deal with it. Yeah, right. Okay, so perhaps don't try and go down that line. No, I don't know. Just to bring you back into politics as well. Really? I want to do that. Campaign. You want to be elected campaigns. Unfortunately, you have to be a brown and she's opposed. So, you know, we've had a nice little run, but, you know. But remember campaign periods and, you know, attack ads. I do. I do remember those. Have a look at this. This is an ad that's being put out amongst a flurry of ads that have been put out by the Labor Party. The Cost of Living Crisis, that's how we at this. This is an ad that's being put out, amongst a flurry of ads that have been put out by the Labour Party. The cost of living crisis, that's how we win this election. That one's authorised by Grant Robertson, a picture of course of Christopher Luxon. Well, that's great because... What would you make of that? Yeah, no, that's really cool. I think we should be in favour of that in National Party because it's a nice picture of Chris. And actually, Chris is really right. The cost of living is the biggest issue that Kiwis face, and the government's completely failed on that front, so good on them. Grant Robertson says it's not a game, it's not about trying to win a competition. Well, I mean, firstly, how amazing is this that you've got the government? I have no doubt probably using taxpayers' resources funneled through the leaders' office somehow where you can't find it, that are paying for these kind of ads. So, secondly, it's a sign of worry. You know, like, I mean, if you spend time talking about your opposite number, you're worried about them, right? And thirdly, you know, if anyone can theoretically control these things, it would be the government. And one of the reasons that cost a living is under so much pressure is because the government's borrowed. It would be a part of $100 billion. You've now got the Reserve Bank Governor firing up interest rates. The biggest single item that most New Zealanders face is their rental, their mortgage, and that's going through the roof, because the Reserve Bank Governor has got no option but to try and counter the spending of the government. So if they want to highlight that issue, I'd say highlight. I haven't spoken to Chris about it, but I'd say highlight it. Well, also, on highlighting the cost of living, is there any highlight, I haven't spoken to Chris about it, but I'd say highlight it. Also, on highlighting the cost of living, is there any political party that hasn't made use of a social issue to try and win an election? No, I mean, look, you think about it, every single election campaign is a campaign about ideas and about how you want to shape the country, and they ultimately always revolve around social issues. I mean, the big issues that matter in any election, the economy, law and order, healthy education, all of those issues are at the forefront of what voters want to hear about. But I just think it's amazing that you've got essentially the opposition setting the agenda. And when the opposition is setting the agenda and the government's missing in action, that might be bad news for the government. Former Prime Minister, Sir John Key, thanks very much for joining us this morning. This is AM. It's Tuesday, the 31st of May. You're with AM. Great to have you watching this morning. Coming up on the show, youth crime and gang violence on the rise in Auckland. Are police equipped to get this under the control? Do they have the tools? I interviewed the police commissioner live in five minutes. Our supermarket duopoly has been put on notice by the government for its excessive profits. So what do the smaller retailers make of this? That's just before 7.30? The Prime Minister is set to meet US President Joe Biden in less than 24 hours. So how important will this meeting be? Her deputy, Grant Robertson, is here at 735. And are you striking out when it comes to online dating? An expert will have all the hot tips to nab that special someone just before nine, but now it's news time. Tolor for Lava good morning. It's two minutes past seven. Justinda Adirne's America trip has hit another obstacle. The Defence Force plane the delegation had been traveling on has broken down in Washington, D.C. The PM was already intending to fly home commercially, but it means another change of plans for the rest of the delegation who are scrambling to book flights. It comes hot on the heels of two of Adirn's top officials testing positive for COVID in San Francisco. Adirn says while it's disappointing, the pair couldn't make it to Washington. The trip is able to continue as planned. Protocols were in place and preparation in place for at any time the delegation to be COVID affected. And that's because, of course, the world is still dealing with COVID. And you will have seen that through this trip. There are still, of course, mask use in place in many places. A lot of testing required throughout this trip. And so it's something we've been prepared for. Tonga is the next target for a group from China that's been sewing up deals with nations across the Pacific. China was hoping to secure a region-wide economic deal with multiple Pacific countries, but several island nations have expressed concern. The delegation signed an agreement with leaders from Fiji on Monday following meetings with Samoa and an earlier deal with the Solomon Islands. But Pacific reporter Edward Kavanaugh told AM early, some Pacific Islands don't want to get caught in the geopolitical crossfire. Some are very concerned about the region becoming a thesis for geopolitical contests between the United States and between China. So despite the fact there were a few of these deals that have been signed, there is a bit of reluctance in the region about deepening ties with China. The US has shut down speculation at sending long-range weaponry to Ukraine. Russian strikes continue to rain down in Ukraine's eastern territory, sparking pleas for more support. Fears of escalating tensions have stopped the supply of heavy-duty missiles to the Ukraine military. US President Joe Biden says that's not going to change. Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine? We're not going to send the Ukraine rocket systems striking the Russia. It comes as another round of EU negotiations fail to land an embargo on Russian energy, with Hungary demanding more securities around oil supply. as another round of EU negotiations fail to land an embargo on Russian energy, with Hungary demanding more securities around oil supply. 21 bodies have been recovered following a plane crash in Nepal. Four Indian and two German nationals are among the dead. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane during a 20-minute flight. Search operations have been hampered by bad weather and mountainous terrain. One passenger is still missing. In sport, Black Caps veteran bowler, Trent Bolt, and batter Henry Nichols are both unlikely to take part in the opening test against England. New Zealand has confirmed its 15-man squad with Michael Braceville added as a 16th man to cover for Nichols, who's in doubt as he continues to recover from a calf injury. Bolt who played in the Indian Premier League final just yesterday arrived in London, putting him in serious doubt for the test at Lords. We'll see how he scrubs up, but I guess I've had conversations with Trent leading up into this. It's part of the world and the way it is right now and I guess with the complexity of putting all schedules together and then you obviously have the IPL on top of that. A home final remains within touching distance for the central pulse after a hard-fought 51-43 victory over the tactics. Kelly Jury continued her red-hot form as she produced another big defensive display to keep the pulse in the match. But it was Captain Tiana Maturo's 85% success rate under the hoop that guided them home after some nervy moments in the second half. It was tight. It was a grind and I think it may have taken us a little bit by surprise but at the same time we kind of expected it because it was their last game. But no, it was super tight and I think I'm just proud that we managed to get ourselves out of that yucky feeling in that sort of tight situation. The victory was the Palsas' ninth of the year as they moved to the top of the A&Z Premiership table overtaking the Northern Mystics. It's news and sport. That's the latest from News Hub, seven minutes past seven. Thanks very much, Bernardine. We are talking supermarkets very soon. We've heard from Ned, who's a pensioner living in Auckland. After all Ned's expenses, he's left with about $123, says, I don't go anywhere, I can't even afford it so much as a coffee. If I did, I haven't brought any new clothes for more than five years. And the gold card I've had for seven months, it's not useful because you have to go out and spend money to get a discount. What little Kiwi saver I had is being whittled away. That said, I am still reasonably happy. There are a lot worse off than me. Good job, I like cheese and crackers. You shouldn't have to be on cheese and crackers. You're eating cheese, Ned, cheese. How are you affording cheese, Ned? The crackers, I can understand. No, good on you. And see, this is the thing. This is the attitude our pensioners have, because they've been through tough times before. They've had to ration things before. They grin and bear it, don't they? They get through it. It's 2022. You shouldn't be eating crackers and cheese. No, it's appalling. Let's take a look at the weather. The weather. Br to you by nature. Turned to power by Meridian. Heavy rainfall and a subtropical low bring weather warnings and weather watches for today. Here it is, heavy rain watches in place for Eastern Bay, Plenty, Northern Gisbon, Tasbin, west of Motueka, and Westland. Fjordland, strong wind watch is in place for you. Let's take a peek at the country hearts looking today this Tuesday. The Lower South can expect a fine day with high cloud right across the region. Oteipote, Dunedinidon, 19 degrees, 16 for Queensland, so the temps are quite warm. To the west coast, there'll be rain, possibly heavy and thundry, easing to showers by the afternoon. Milford's 16, 17 for you, Hawker Ticker. Canterbury and Marlborough, a little bit of sunshine there. It's going to be fine, warm, a little bit of cloud throughout the day. Christchurch, Otahe, 20 degrees, Nelson 17. To the low north, cloudy with possible shards. Those winds are going to be strong and exposed places. So Wellington, 17 and windy, Masterton, 19 degrees. Central Plateau is, well, it's a little bit of everything. Shows for most of the region with possible thunderstorms and even hail for New Plymouth this morning. Hwanganui 20, 16 degrees for Taupo and on the east coast. To any rain should clear by late morning. It's still a cloudy day, light winds. 20 is expected for Gisbon on the Mercury 17 for Rotterua. And to the top of the country, you can expect a cloudy day light winds. 20 is expected for Gisbon on the Mercury 17th Rotorua. And to the top of the country, you can expect a cloudy old day with isolated showers. There will be morning fog for Keri Keriro and thunderstorms for Fungare. Tamaki Makara, Auckland. Fitianga, 20 degrees. Thanks, Bernardine. It is now nine after seven. Auckland is facing a rising crime wave. The city's been inundated with ram raids, gang shootings, youth crime. Take a look. Communities need to feel safer. These business owners, they should not be living in fear every day. We heard these loud bangs as if someone was slamming a door. It is quite stupid. There's no room in our city for this sort of gangster behaviour. We fully support a strong crackdown by the police on them. When you live out here, you have to take what's given to us. You want to move him here? Why? It's not there for my family. We are the move or we get a gun. And I don't want to have to pick up a gun and shoot anybody It's only a matter of time before we see someone seriously injured or killed So if you think you've seen more reports of armed violence You would be right last year was a record year for gun crime in New Zealand And for those dairy owners watching Dairy and Convenience Store Thift was up at least 30% on 20%. Burglaries were up nearly 20%. I'm joined now by the Police Commissioner Andrew Costa. Commissioner Morden, good morning. Good morning. Can we start with the guns? We'll do guns and gangs and we'll do crime generally this morning. The guns, particularly the ones used in these shootings in Auckland. What sort of guns are they? We've got a variety of guns being used from high-powered rifles through to less serious firearms, but in the end they're all dangerous. We are dealing with the consequences of decades of lacks gun control. We now have the funding to set up good regulation. We have the legislation, but it will take some time to have an regulation. We have the legislation, but it will take some time to have an effect. Where did the guns come from? Where did they get them? They come from a variety of places, whether it's stolen and burglaries, diverted away from the lawful fleet by an unscrupulous license holder. We've seen a range of things. Okay. How many guns do criminals have in New Zealand? we've seen a range of things. Okay. How many guns do criminals have in New Zealand? Well, we know in New Zealand as a whole. There are 1.5 million firearms, or thereabout. Obviously, we've recovered a huge number of firearms in the last period of Operation Tofeiro, but there are clearly more to find. Australia's experience, when they tightened up their firearms control, was that it took 20 years to start to see the real benefits. And so clearly that's too long. And police is working in a whole lot of other ways to target the groups that are perpetuating this violence. So how many guns do criminals have? You don't know. Clearly we don't know. Clearly we don't know the answer to that. If we did, we wouldn't have the problem. Are you taking guns? Because I've seen your press releases. There's don't know the answer to that. If we did, we wouldn't have the problem. Are you taking guns? Because I've seen your press releases. There's a lot of congratulating going on about the confiscation, the seizure of weapons. Are you taking guns off gangs faster than they are able to procure them? Look, I believe we are having an impact here. But clearly this is a... Commissioner, how can you know that if you don't know how many guns the gangs have? Yeah, look, clearly there's a huge amount that we don't know. But what I can say is that we now have the tools that we need to tighten up, be it around who gets a firearms licence, around accountability, that if you buy a firearm today, you've still got it, unless you've sold it to someone who's allowed it. All of those things need to come through, and they will take time. So in the meantime, we have to target those who see fit to use this violence. So the problem I have with this is, as you say, you don't know what you don't know, but you keep saying that things are getting better, that the community is getting safer. You said that after the gun buyback scheme. Do you feel, do police officers feel, that the community is getting safer. You said that after the gun buyback scheme. Do you feel, do police officers feel, that the community is safer now than in 2019? Clearly we're in an incredibly challenging period at the moment. We've got, particularly in Auckland, a couple of groups who are at each other, and doing that they're endangering the public. And so what we are doing is targeting those groups with every enforcement measure we can find to send a message about their behaviour. The long-term game here is tightening up firearms control, but with one and a half million firearms in this country, we've got a huge amount of work to do before we can say that that situation is dramatically improved. Do you feel safer now than you did two years ago? Oh, look, I think everyone has to acknowledge this is a very difficult period that we are in and that we have been through over the last couple of years. So I understand if people are feeling unsafe. Commissioner, when will the period end? Because we've had you tell us that the gun buyback scheme, the $100 million that was spent was going to make us safer and make people feel safer. You've put out press releases saying how many guns you're taking off the criminals and that we're all going to feel safer. When will we actually be safer? Look, this is a long, as I said at the start, this is a long-term game. It takes quite a while to get the right controls in place and for those to have an effect. We committed to doing that. We must do that for the safety of our country. You're saying that this level of violence will continue for the next 20 years? No, not at all. I'm saying that in terms of gun control, it's a long-term game. The violence and gangs comes and goes over time. We are in an elevated period at the moment. There's no doubt about that. And we are doing the right things to target the groups to send the message and hold them accountable. You say that you've got all the tools that you need. What about, and this was an idea put forward by Nicole McKee, allowing police officers to seize the assets of gang members if they are found with an illegal firearm, would that not make your job a hell of a lot easier? Because if you're a gang member and you know that if you're found with an illegal firearm, you could lose your Harley, would that not help you guys? We are providing advice to government on tools to target both unlawfully obtained assets and gangs generally. So there's always opportunity for improvement there and we will provide that advice to government. Have you asked for something like this from the government so far? We are providing advice on a range of things, including in relation to assets and there is legislation underway at the moment that will work into that area and also in relation to how we target gangs generally. So can you be more specific about what you've asked for? No, not at the stage. Our responsibility is advice to government, but what I can say is there's always opportunity to improve the tools that we have, and we are providing that advice, and it will be a matter for Parliament as to what tools are provided. Okay, let's put that to the side for one second. Would, does this idea appeal to you? If the police could go in, see a gang member with a gun and tell them they lose their Harley, would that help you? Look, there's a real balancing act to be struck here. Balance between what? Between the rights and freedoms in a democratic country and our ability to target... The rights of a gang member to own Harley....behavior. Look, I'm not defending that. All I'm saying is those balancing acts are for Parliament. We will provide the advice that we can provide. Clearly, any tool that helps us to target gangs will be welcome. However, there's always trade-offs in that, and those aren't ours to make. Have you asked for the 24-7 tactical response teams to be, I mean, and that's your decision really, isn't it? Are you considering bringing them back? So the tactical response model for which we've received $200 million of funding in the budget just gone, will see us deploying our specialist groups right across our policing districts. It will see an increase in tactical teams who can provide the support needed. It will also see our frontline equipped in a much better way to deal with the issues they're facing. So I'm very confident about what we're doing there. Okay. Let's talk about the gang numbers. I want to play your clip here. This is from Billy McFarlane, who is a gang rehab advocate. He works closely with those who are in gangs, around gangs, on the fringe of gangs. Here's what he told us about the number of gang members in New Zealand last week. How many people, roughly, do you believe that there are involved in gangs? I think the numbers are grossly underestimated. I believe we already have more gang members in the country than we've got police. Well, the estimate is 7,000. Yeah, but I think they're counting the main gangs, but there's like around 50 street gangs on Auckland alone. Commissioner, do you know how many gang members there are in New Zealand? The numbers range here massively. If we went back in time in our NEA system, you could get a number that went 37,000 gang members. But actually, when you look into it, a lot of that data is inaccurate. You've got associates. We're working through it. The best indicator that we've got is the national gang list. That is at about 8,000. But there are a lot of other people who may be suspected of gang membership that we haven't been able to prove it out. So I saw an academic paper from Jared Gilbert that said 22,000, honestly, and what's a gang anyway? Because we've got teenagers who group up and call themselves a gang. Is that someone we should be worried about or not? I don't think of folks on numbers. When they're ramming cars into dearies, I'd think so, Commissioner. You mentioned 37,000. Has one of your staff told you that number, 37,000? Is that police intelligence? That was the number, that was, if you go back, and this is a few years back, if you said, well, how many alerts are there in our near system about gang members? You had a number of 37,000. Actually, when we've gone through that, the information was pretty unreliable. We don't aim to capture that information to provide a statistic. We use it for operational purposes. We use it for intelligence and targeting. We're focused on the behaviour. You can get tied up in the numbers, but actually we need to worry about what's happening. But aren't the numbers really important because they will determine your response to the problem. I'm looking at a report from February of last year when there was huge controversy around the number of gang members and the fact we didn't really know. Have you seriously not asked somebody for hard data since February last year? If you think about what we would have to do to demonstrate this, we've got a bunch of people who we would suspect maybe gang involved. Are we going to go and visit them all and say, are you in a gang? When was the last time you attended a club meeting? In the end, what police needs to be concerned about is the overall trends and behaviour. That's where we focus our effort, and our people are incredibly focused on targeting the unlawful behaviour of gangs. We are concerned about gangs as a problem more generally but most of the solutions to the underlying social issues outside of police's domain. Commissioner, do you accept that your change in policy on police pursuits has led to more ram raids, particularly across Auckland? No, I don't. The people who are involved in these ram raids, many of them are under 15. We need to look seriously at why those kids are not productively engaged. There are a lot of kids not going to school post-COVID. The policy we are looking at, you know, there's a real balance again to be struck here. The 10 years before the policy change, we killed 60 people through police pursuits. No one has died in a police pursuit since we changed the policy. But obviously there's a balance. And the question is, well, for what offence would we be prepared to put the public at risk by engaging in a pursuit? So you're looking at changing your pursuits policy? We are looking at fine-tuning it, but it will be in the nature of fine-tuning if there's any change. The fundamental position lines up with what other jurisdictions are doing and looks like international best practice. Is this something that you have decided to do off your own bat, or is the government telling you to do this? This is my decision. It sits with me, and it's not the government's place to dictate that. Do you feel you made a mistake changing that policy? No, I don't. I have no regrets about saving the lives that we've saved. I do find, you know, it's clearly it's massive responsibility to work out where the balance sits and we have to get it right. The reality is if we change the policy to pursue in certain circumstances, then we do increase the risk and inevitably there will be consequences. In any given case, it can be hard to justify why a certain thing happened when you have to look at that book. And there will be dairy owners and shop owners in Auckland who are literally sleeping in front of a CCTV camera saying, I'm sorry, the consequences should be borne by the person who decides to take illegal action? Yeah, look, of course, but the problem is we don't get to decide who dies when a pursuit crashes. We need to remember we are holding these young people to account too. We've laid literally hundreds of charges for young people involved in these ram raids. That in itself is not going to solve the problem. It's an important thing to do. But clearly, you're not going to send a bunch of under 15-year-olds to prison. So where are the other solutions coming out of community, coming out of understanding why these kids aren't well engaged, because we can arrest them as much as you like. In the end, if they're back out, back into the same environment arrest them as much as you like in the end if they're back out, back into the same environment that meant they went into that in the first place then that's where our problem sits. All right. Commissioner, as always, I really appreciate you coming on the programme. Thank you very much for your time this morning. Thank you. That's the Police Commissioner Andrew Costa. So a couple of things out of that this morning. One, the police are now re-looking at their pursuits policy, making some changes. The other thing that we've heard from the Commissioner this morning is that they're looking at the seizure of assets from gangs and how that relates to the seizure of firearms, something that Nicole McKee from the Act Party has been pushing for and the government has rejected in the last few weeks, 23 after 7. An update on the PM's delegation and COVID tests. We'll have that next. Also coming up, our smaller retailers celebrating this morning.

Good morning, thanks for joining us on AM. Just a very quick update. A third member of the Prime Minister's delegation has tested positive for COVID. We'll have more on that with Grant Robertson soon. It's 27 minutes past seven. Goodness me. Right. New Zealand supermarket, Geopoly, has been told it needs to change at pace or face regulation. Government yesterday sent the warning to Woolworths and foodstuffs who control 90% of grocery retail in this country. So what are the 10% of retailers outside the Geopoly think? Night and Day general manager, Matthew Lane, is with us this morning. Matthew, good morning. What are your thoughts? Yeah, very happy with the announcement yesterday. It's a practical step in the right direction and clear acknowledgement is an issue in New Zealand. Does it make it easier for an outfit like yours to expand? Yeah, well, we'll do. Also provide value to our consumers. Our goal is to spam, but it's pretty hard when you're relying on voluntary supply from ultimately your competitors. Yeah, can you explain that bit to us? You're rel relied on the big boys to get your food and drink into stores? Correct. Traditionally, we've relied on places such as Gilmores and Trents, which are wholesalers of groceries. However, their prices are considerably more expensive than what a consumer can buy the products for within the supermarket. So it makes it impossible to provide value to the consumers and subsequently grow your business to a scale required to actually take market share. Right. So they tack on a bit to what they're charging you guys to make sure that you can't get too big for your boots. That is correct. Doesn't seem very fair. No. And that's why you see a lot of the dairy owners and the light lining up at supermarkets. They're ultimately paying what the consumer's paying and trying to make a viable business out of that. Do you think any of these changes will actually lead to cheaper prices? Because if you're all paying the same for the same goods... Yeah, absolutely it will. Competition is the most effective mechanism to reduce prices. By building competition, it makes the marketplace more competitive. When a marketplace is more competitive, prices drop. We see that across every other industry. Unfortunately, there's just not enough players in the market to really, I guess, keep everyone on their toes and play that price game, which we want to really, I guess, keep everyone on their toes and play that price game, which we want to see, I guess, for the benefit of New Zealand. Have you done any numbers? Have you run any numbers? Do you know how much cheaper my grocery bill could be if night and day was able to become a big boy? Yeah, it's hard to tell at this stage. I think, you know, the best example out there at the moment on a limited scale was the warehouse. They've discounted significant essential lines and actually showed that value can be provided and on a wider scale if the ability was there. And we've seen subsequent reactions to that, such as price freezers and rollbacks on similar lines. Matthew, thank you very much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Night and day, general manager Matthew Lane. It has much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Night and day general manager Matthew Lane. It has just gone half seven this morning. That means it's time for the news. To law for lava. Good morning. It's 7.30. The police commissioner has said that some changes to the police pursuit policy could be on the way. The changes may not be major, but more fine-tuning of rules that Andrew Costa says have been working through as intended. Costa told AM he has no regret stopping the pursuits as it saved lives, but realises small changes need to be made to deter those ram rating. We are looking at fine-tuning it, but it will be in the nature of a fine-tuning if there's any change. The fundamental position lines up with what other jurisdictions are doing and looks like international best practice. There's been another positive COVID case in the Prime Minister's America delegation bringing the total to three in the last two days. It's not yet known who the person is but they returned a positive PCR test upon arriving in Washington, D.C. this morning than our self-isolating. It's just another obstacle after a series of dramas on the trip, the Defence Force plane they'd been travelling on, has broken down in the US Capitol. The PM was already intending on flying home commercially, but it means another change of plans for the rest of the group. We're all going to plan from here on. Gissandra Adirn will finally have her highly anticipated meeting with US President Joe Biden tomorrow. Former Prime Minister, Sir John Key, is one of the only people who knows what it's like to meet with the president and says Adirn will have lots of issues she'll want to touch on, but chances are not actually, will actually be achieved. In some sense, it's not a hell of a lot, but you build a relationship and rapport and get an opportunity to get to know the person a little bit better. You don't have a lot of time. You feel like you do but in reality by the time you get in there and get through the pleasantries and go through the agenda and you'll have a few things that you want to tell the New Zealand media I hit these particular points. An early morning scuffle between flatmates has caused a large police turnout in Christchurch this morning. Emergency services were called to a fight just after 6 o'clock at a residential property on Dunoon Place in Wollstone. Police say one person has been taken into custody and another has minor injuries following the assault. Police remain at the scene. There's cautious optimism. The European Union will come to an agreement on a ban on Russian oil within the week. If passed, it would be the sixth round of sanctions imposed by the EU since the invasion of Ukraine. Member states have met in Brussels with reports indicating all 27 countries agree in principle. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says they're just ironing out the details. This package, we are not there yet, but it has matured for sure. My expectations are low that it will be solved in the next 48 hours, but I'm confident that thereafter there will be a possibility. Hungary has indicated it needs more energy securities before it gives the oil ban seal of approval. In Sport, UEFA has commissioned an independent report into the incredible scenes prior to Sunday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Rail Madrid. Kick off at the start of France in Paris was delayed due to Liverpool ticket holders waiting in huge queues, with French police using tear gas to disperse crowds. French authorities blame the debacle outside the stadium what they call industrial scale ticket fraud. UEFA says a review would examine a number of factors which would include the decision-making, responsibility and behaviours of all parties involved in the final. Four-seed, Stefanoz Sitsapas, has been bundled out of the French Open after losing to teenager Holger Rune. Sitzapas became the highest ranked player in the men's draw to be sent packing as he was punished for a lacklust of display. Rune, who'd never won a Grand Slam match a week ago, dropped only one set as he became the first Danish man to reach the quarterfinals. And in the women's draw, number one, world number one, Ega Swantak, survived a scare from Chinese teenager Chin Wen Jun when she was forced to fight back from a set down to win. That's very latest from Newsup. It is 26-28. Thanks very much, Bernardine. Lots of feedback coming in about gangs, as you can probably understand. People just saying that they've had enough, they're fed up, they're sick of it, particularly those living in Auckland. And we've heard the stories. Can you imagine teaching your children how to hide from bullets, the stray bullets that might come through the window? It was on the news the other night. Just within the last couple of weeks, not even two weeks, actually, there's been around 20 shootings that are being investigated in the Auckland region, all around Auckland too, in various suburbs. So I would imagine there are a lot of people who feel not very safe if it's happened in their street. How does this play on the global scale? We've had Jacinda Adirne saying that we have banned military-style weapons, yet there are reports back home of exactly this happening. It's kind of embarrassing. Yeah. Hey, just on the rubbish trucks, William is going to join us from, you know, the rubbish truck that goes down your street. William's actually going to be on one of those and talking to us and talking to the owner of the company shortly. You're a bit jelly, aren't you? Look, you're jealous. I am. They are fascinating. I always want to know what's inside the back of the thing for a start. I mean, obviously rubbish. But I picture a big hand, just a big mincing it all up inside. But is there, I don't know. I think it just all goes into a pile. It's a compressor. It gets compressed. It would fill up, wouldn't it? Sue, if you've got a question for your rubbish man, feedback at aamshow.co.com. Su's question, when the bin gets damaged, why does it take many days or weeks to repair it? That's the council. True. Shane says, when I put my rubbish out each week, I can't believe how many used face masks are lying around my entrance. They are all over the place, aren't they? Oh, he says, even out hunting in the forest in the weekend, face masks everywhere. What do you need a face mask for in the forest? They want to fall out of pockets and things like that. Yeah, but are the trees going to give you COVID? But those hunters would be stopping at the bakery on the way home for their pine, they don't art. What a shame. Let's take a look at the weather. The weather brought to you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. Heavy rainfall in a subtropical low bring weather warnings and watches for today. Here we go. Heavy rain watches also in place for eastern bay of plenty. Northern Gisbon, Tasman, west of Mottweka and Westland, Fieldland, strong wind watch is in place for you. The low south today, let's have a little peak. Expect a fine day with high cloud across the region. Dunedin 19 degrees, 16 for Queenstown. And as we pop across to the west coast, there will be rain, possibly heavy and thundery. Easing to shawls by the afternoon, Milford Sound 16 degrees, little warmer in Hokotika on 17 and Canterbury and Malbara. Fine and warm, mostly cloudy though. Christchurch, 20 degrees, 17 for Nelson. Moving up the country to the Lava North Island at Clare Day, possible showers. Wind strong and exposed places. Wellington 17, Masterton, 19 degrees. Central Plateau. Bit of everything. Shows for most of the region. Possible thunderstorms in hail for New Plymouth this morning. Funganui 20, just 16 for Taupor on the east coast. Rain should clear by late morning. Funganui 20, just 16 for Taupor on the east coast. Rain should clear by late morning. Claree daylight wins. 20 for the mercury. Gisbon, Rotoa 17. And to the top of the country, a cloudy day, isolated showers. There'll be morning fog for Keri-Kerri-Kirrond, thunderstorms for Fungare. Tamaki Makara, Auckland. And Frianga, 20 degrees. Thanks very much, Bernardine. The government's given our supermarket duopoly a firm warning, change at pace or face regulation. So when will we see any price changes and will that help our grocery bills? Acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson joins us on AM this morning. Thank you very much for being with us, Minister. If I can start by asking, because I imagine you've done the numbers, what percentage do you want supermarket prices to come down by? Well, yeah, well, look, we haven't done a specific number like that because I think if I did, obviously New Zealanders would think, well, is that enough? Could it be more? We want to make sure that there is competition in the supermarket sector, and we simply haven't had that. The more competitors we get in, the more pressure they'll be to reduce. could it be more? We want to make sure that there is competition in the supermarket sector. And we simply haven't had that. The more competitors we get in, the more pressure there will be to reduce prices. And we think that we're addressing two of the really big issues here for a competitor, the land to actually build a supermarket, and we've introduced legislation to stop the land banking that supermarkets have been doing, and the wholesale market, the things that would, the regulations that will mean that actually a competitor can have goods that they put on their shelves. Those two things will facilitate supermarkets coming in, and that's what we'll see prices go down. Okay, so this threat of regulation, at what point then does that kick in if you don't have a kind of set target for the supermarkets to reach? We've said that we'll have that regulatory backstop in place by the end of the year if we haven't been able to get an agreement from the duopoly to open up their wholesale offering to make sure that those competitors can get in there. There's a lot of work to do to design that scheme properly and we've obviously seen some reaction from the duopoly already with some of the gestures they've made around prices, but not having a regulatory backstop like this means that we would be relying on their goodwill. We need to see action from them rather than goodwill, and if we don't see that action by the end of the year, that regulatory backstop will be in place. But it's not a definite? Well, if we can get what we need from them, a commitment and a guarantee that that wholesale market will be opened up, then we won't need to go to the regulatory result. But if they don't, and we don't see that action through the year, we're now designing that regulatory backstop as we speak. What other sectors should be worried by this, by seeing the supermarkets, the duopoly, put on notice? What other sectors should be worried that they might be next? Well, the Commerce Commission did what's called a market study, and that's why we've got this information, and all of the actions you're now seeing out a result of that. We've already done one of those in the petrol area, and the next one of those is in building supplies. Similarly to groceries, New Zealanders pay way too much for our basic building supplies relative to other countries. And so that's the Commerce Commission's next piece of work and we'll follow up on that once we get their report. Okay, I just want to turn to the Prime Minister and the delegation in the US now. We're hearing this morning that a third member of the delegation has tested positive for COVID with a PCR test. What more can you tell us about that? Look, I haven't got any further information on that. Obviously, a couple of people have already tested positive. That's not a huge surprise. COVID is very much still around in the United States, and there are strict protocols around people when they go into the White House, obviously, testing negative. The Prime Minister's had her bout of COVID. She's fine, she's there. That's obviously the most significant thing in terms of the meeting with President Biden, and I'm sure others from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and within the delegation will be there to support her. Just back here, is it still the case that the official health advice from the government is that if you're a close contact of somebody with COVID, you have to isolate for seven days? It remains if you're a close contact of somebody with COVID you have to isolate for seven days? It remains that you're a household contact. I'm not sure what you mean by the definition of close contact but if you are a household contact yeah, it is still the advice yes. Okay so the delegation that is travelling overseas that are part of making these rules here in New Zealand, a government delegation if the rules are there because of the health advice you set in your own country, why aren't they are part of making these rules here in New Zealand, a government delegation. If the rules are there because of the health advice you set in your own country, why aren't they isolating for seven days if they've been travelling very closely with people who are getting COVID? When you're in a country, you obviously deal with the rules and the regulations of the country you're in. In terms of those people returning to New Zealand, we still have the pre-departure testing regime, which means before they come back into New Zealand, they're going to need to have a clear result, a negative test. While they're in the United States of America, they're dealing with that. But those who've tested positive as far as I'm aware are isolating right now as per the protocols of the places that they're in. Do you think it makes sense that for people who set these rules then go overseas and don't follow the rules, which are based on the health advice, I guess, that they're sitting for the rest of the country here? Well, they are following the rules. They're following the rules for the country that they're in, and when they return to New Zealand, they'll follow the rules for New Zealand. They won't get to come back to New Zealand until they've had a clear test. So everybody can feel safe and secure in that knowledge. Okay. So do you think that the seven days isolation might be revised here soon? We continue to take advice from our health officials on what they believe to be the correct approach. They have continued to advise us that seven days is the appropriate and approach for New Zealand and that's what we'll keep doing. Different countries do have different rules and many New Zealanders are now experiencing that as they travel around but as I say, those who have tested positive in the US I'm aware are isolating as we speak. Gun control is likely to come up in this meeting with President Biden and the Prime Minister tomorrow, given its prominence in the news agenda over there. What do you say to several frontline officers that have written into our program saying they feel it's a bit rich for the Prime Minister to be talking about gun control and what we've done here in New Zealand when just in Auckland they're investigating 20 shootings potentially gang-related in the last couple of weeks. Look, when the Prime Minister spoke in her speech at Harvard, she was clear that New Zealand's not perfect. You know, we have our own issues that we need to deal with. In response to the March 15th terrorist attack, we did move swiftly to ban semi-automatic weapons. The presence of other weapons and indeed some of those weapons in our community is something that we're dealing with right now and we have to keep working through. So I don't think the Prime Minister was saying anything other than the fact that we do need to take action. That action needs to be sustained and that's the work that's now going on and I know you've had Commissioner Costa on the program. It's the work that the police are continuing to do to make sure that we get on top of the issues involving gangs and obviously many of them involve guns as well. And one of the issues that the police commissioner raised this morning is that there will be changes or they're looking at fine tuning the policy around police pursuits. Does that sound like a good way to tackle the spike in crime we're seeing recently? Well we have to give the police all of the tools that they need to be able to take on anyone who's breaking the law. Police pursuit policy has changed at different times over the years to make sure that it not only keeps the community safe, police safe, but enables them to catch up with criminals. So obviously, we listen to the advice on that and we'll take any suggestions that the police have on board. That's only one element though, isn't it, of what we need to do here. We have dedicated parts of our police force now focused on this. We've seen Operation Toferro, which has seen, I think, about 1,600 weapons seized and about 1,300 arrests. We just have to make sure we get on top of these gangs and that they are not causing the stress that I know that they are for many Aucklanders at the moment. I want to talk about politics, campaign politics at the moment. Lately there's been a flurry of ads on the New Zealand Labour Party page. And one of them, of which was authorised by yourself. If we can have a look at that picture, it says, you'll know this one, it says the cost of living crisis, that's how we'll win this election. There's a picture of Christopher Luxon there. What's your issue with that quote? Well, the cost of living crisis is not about politics. The cost of living crisis is about households in New Zealand who are struggling to make ends meet because we've got this massive global inflation spike. Christopher Luxon just seems to see it as some sort of political gain and I think it's worth highlighting that to New Zealanders and also highlighting at the same time that our response has been to step up, cut the price of public transport and half, cut the price of petrol, give people a $350 cost of living payment. This is a serious issue, and it seemed to us that Mr Luxon simply saw it as politics. So when Labor was in opposition and there was a housing crisis that you were trying to get the National Party to admit at that time, was it not fair to say that that was a political issue? Well, Mr Loxen's got to stand by the statement he made. He stood up at a National Party conference over the weekend and said the cost of living crisis is how we're going to win the election. Have you never used a social issue for political gain? Has the Labour Party never used a social issue for political gain? Well Mr Luxin has to stand up for those comments and we would have had to have stood up for any comments we made at the time. This is happening right now. Someone has to hold Mr Luxent to account and we'll do that. Have you never used, has the Labor Party never used a social issue for political gain? I'm in politics because I want people's lives to improve and be better. Every single day I get up and I come into this building and I go out into the community to try to do that. Of course, when it comes to election time, we have to put ourselves out there and see whether the public will support us. But right now, we have a cost of living crisis for a lot of New Zealanders. We've stepped up to the plate to help them deal with that. And we saw Mr Luxon play politics. So isn't what Mr Luxon is doing is putting an issue out there, which was the cost of living crisis, and seeing what the public responds to, just as you said yourself that you do. They're putting out the cost of living crisis and saying if the public responds, that's how we'll win the election. Mr Luxon has to explain himself as to why he sees the cost of living crisis as connected to him winning the next election. He's the one that drew that connection. I would say a lot of New Zealanders would feel that the cost of living crisis is key to the next election. I think a lot of New Zealanders will feel that addressing the cost of living crisis is important to their day-to-day grocery bills, what they pay at the petrol pump. Which would drive who they vote for? That's why we've put that forward. That's what we're focused on. That's why we've put that forward. It just sounds to us like Mr Luxon thinks it's a political game and it's not. In terms of political games and I know the Prime Minister herself has spoken a lot about previously about personality politics and when Labor was in opposition in 2017 the whole idea around the campaign was that she would be relentlessly positive. Now that you're in government does the campaign strategy change? You would have seen, as I think you mentioned, that there is a lot of material that's produced by the Labor Party for social media. Over the last few weeks, I reckon there's probably been dozens and dozens of things that promote the positive stuff that we're doing in the budget. So John King said earlier that this looks like a government that's worried? No, this is a government that wants to make sure that we get our program out there and there are dozens and dozens of the things promoting the positive things that we're doing in the budget. And there is a handful of things that are holding the national opposition to account because somebody does have to do that.

The police commissioner says there's still a lot of work to do before police can say the gun violence problem has improved. It follows a spate of shootings and gang crimes in Auckland, which have left many feelings scared for their safety. Commissioner Andrew Costa told AM, although they're doing everything they can, there's still a lot more to do. What we are doing is targeting those groups with every enforcement measure we can find to send a message about their behaviour. The long-term game here is tightening up firearms control, but with one and a half million firearms in this country, we've got a huge amount of work to do before we can say that that situation is dramatically improved. And in a new development, Commissioner Costa also told AM that changes to the pursuit policy are coming in a bid to deal with the spike in ram raids. Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says he backs whatever decision the police make. Well, we have to give the police all of the tools that they need to be able to take on anyone who's breaking the law. Police pursuit policy has changed at different times over the years to make sure that it not only keeps the community safe, police safe, but enables them to catch up with criminals. So obviously we listen to the advice on that and we'll take any suggestions that the police have on board. There's been another positive COVID case in the Prime Minister's America delegation, bringing the total to three in the last two days. It's not yet known who the person is, but they returned a positive PCR test upon arriving in Washington, D.C. this morning. They're now self-isolating. It's just another obstacle after a series of dramas on the trip, the Defence Force plane they'd been travelling on has broken down in the US Capitol. The PM was already intending on flying home commercially, but it means another change of plans for the rest of the group. Meanwhile, Jacinda Adirn will sit down with US President Joe Biden tomorrow morning with China's influence in the Pacific expected to be a key topic of conversation. But former Prime Minister Sir John Key thinks Al-Tirot should be working with China and worry about having a good relationship with the Chinese military over America. I think going off to China and saying, hey, don't be in the Pacific, that's a waste of time. China's going to be there. They're going to be there forever. The Americans have been worried for a very long period of time. The Americans will say, quite simply, we have the whole world to worry about, by the way, you're sitting out there, you're in Australia, it's your backyard, deal with it. A small player in the grocery sector is confident the cost of living crisis will ease after the government announced its plans to increase supermarket competition. Supermarkets now have to open their wholesale arms to smaller competitors, label products with unit pricing and work by a code of conduct to give supplies bargaining power. Night and day general manager, Matthew Lane, told AM, the changes will lead to cheaper prices, saying competition is the most effective tool to bring costs down. By building competition, it makes the marketplace more competitive. When a marketplace is more competitive prices drop, we see that across every other industry. Unfortunately, there's just not enough players in the market to really, I guess, keep everyone on their toes and play that price game. In sport, the black caps have reduced their squad to 15 players ahead of their upcoming three test series against England. Wellington all-rounder Michael Bracewell were acted as 16th man for the first test starting at Lords on Thursday. Bracewell is covering for Henry Nichols who's in doubt for the first test as he continues to recover from a right calf injury. Yeah, at the moment we think it's unlikely that Henry will play. Obviously with the COVID, that just put him back another week or so from where we were wanting. But he is progressing really well. I think at the moment he's an unlikely starter. The central pulse have shot to the top of the ANZ premiership with a hard fought 51-43 win over the tactics. A big defensive effort from co-captain Kelly Jury ensured the pulse retained a one-goal lead he ended the final quarter. The visitors then pulled clear of the tactics to claim their ninth win of the year which saw them overtake them all the mystics on the ladder on goal percentage. Well, we know that a home grand final is on the line and we really want that. We really want that for ourselves and we really want that for our fans. So, yeah, one more game to go. The pulse will square off against the Mystics on Friday for a chance to secure the minor premiership and a home final. Spanish canine trainers are giving doggy paddle a whole new meaning.

We are heading shortly to William, who is out with the rubbish collection this morning, and we've got a few questions about how it all works. If you do too, let us know. Feedback at Amshow.com.n.z. Now is the time to find out just how how it all works. If you do too let us know feedback at aamshow.co. Now is the time to find out just how that rubbish truck works. But we have also been receiving a lot of feedback this morning on the interview with Grant Robertson and particularly about this campaign ad that has criticised Christopher Luxon and the National Party for saying that the cost of living crisis is an issue that is going to, they believe, win them the next election. This is from one of our views. He says, this is a quote from Robertson. Mr. Luxon will have to be held to account. This viewer says, well, Mr. Robertson, we will be holding you to account at the next election. Camilla says, unbelievable comment that the cost of the living crisis isn't political. Of course it is. All political parties are making hay while the sun shines. That's just what they do, which I think most Kiwis would accept, wouldn't they? Yeah. I mean, it's pretty crude. I didn't hear the context in which you made the comments, but it is pretty crude to say, like, we're going to win off the back of this crisis. And the minister's point was that it's not a game. The cost of living is something that is serious, and it should be taken as something serious, not just a pawn and a game to win in an election. Yeah, but in saying that, we all know politicians, and we all know, like, okay, imagine that door closes on the ninth floor of the beehive for a second and cameras are gone, media's gone, all the riffraffs out of the room. We've got to hammer them on that. We've got to get them on that cost of living and we've got to get them on that housing crisis. You can imagine what they would talk like. Yeah. And I don't think standing there and pretending, you know, you're not a politician. It's not really going to wash with people, is it? Also, you've got to play the game to get into a position where you can make changes. Otherwise, why are you there? Let's take a look at the weather. The weather brought you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. Heavy rainfall and a subtropical low bring weather warnings and weather watches for today. A heavy rain watch in place for eastern bay of plenty, northern Gisbon, Tasman, west of Motoweka and Western Fjordland, strong wind warnings in place. The Lower South can expect a fine day, high cloud across the region. Oteipote de need nice and warm 19 degrees today. Queenstown, 16. To the west coast, there'll be rain, possibly heavy and thundery, easing to showers by the afternoon. 16 for you, Milford Sound. Orkittaker, 17. Over on the East Coast. Canterbury and Malbara, it'll be warm and fine. There will be some cloud around. Christchewate, Otahe, 2017 for Nelson. To the lower north, it'll be cloudy with possible showers. The wind is the problem, strong and exposed places. Wellington, 17, 19, Masterton, Central Plateau. Everything thrown at you today. A few showers for most of the region, possible thunderstorms and hail for New Plymouth. Wanganui 20, po'pour. Little cooler on 16. Over on the East Coast. Any rain should clear. We'll be cloudy, though, with light winds. The mercury will hit 20 in Gisbon, Rotterua, aiming for 17. And to the top of the country, you can expect a cloudy day with isolated showers, morning fog for Hamilton, and thunderstorms for Fungaree. Tamaki Makaro, Auckland and Fittiana, 20 degrees today. Thanks very much, Bernardine. Right, we are going to check in with William now because there have been concerns raised about how joggers, runners and pedestrians are interacting with rubbish trucks. Williams, with a rubbish truck collector and owner this morning. William, good morning. Morena, Ryan. I'm here with waste management legend this morning William good morning. Morena Ryan, morena. I'm here with waste management legend and the world's best truck driver Neville. Neville tell us about some of the safety issues in the community with the trucks. Sure, well currently we're having a few issues with people just getting a little bit too close to the guys operating out on the road so basically we're trying to promote the bin day, let's do that the safe way. These particular arms themselves have a lot of power and they're capable of taking out a power pole or lifting a fridge. So don't be tempted on your rubbish day. Give us enough room. Don't be tempted to come out with your last piece of rubbish while the guy is trying to empty the bin. So people actually come out while this is operating and put there? Absolutely, absolutely. So unless the driver has actually seen you, there could be a lot of problems there. Yeah, absolutely. And these will be kid magnets as well, children magnets. But kids come out, wow, truck, rubbish truck. Kids are absolutely fascinated. So if you can keep your kids away from the truck, obviously give us a little bit of room, then everybody, we don't want to hurt anybody. Yeah, exactly, and there's joggers as well, I do a bit of running. I don't have my air pods in, but earphones or anything, but you would get people being unaware, running past, and this is operating, bam. Absolutely. People with scooters, for example, you know, they come up on us pretty quickly. If we're operating first thing in the morning, obviously it's still a little bit dark. That tends to be quite a cause some problems there with not seeing the truck or we're not seeing the people walking past. Absolutely. So what's going to mitigate that, Neville? Just give us a bit of room, you know. If you can see the driver, if they can see you, more than likely they're going to stop what they're doing, let you pass. But they have to see you first. Absolutely. Well, let's see, you said refrigerate, let's see, let's see this in action, this raw power. I'll get out of your way. I don't want to be in amongst that raw power. But guys, as Neville was saying that, they haven't, that has enough power to jack up a refrigerator. So here we go. Here we go. Let's see that raw power in action. Look that. All right. Oh. So you mentioned coming through, coming under there, good shake at the top. But running past, bang, good night. Yeah, beauty. Cut that Neville. So there you go. That is the raw power of that arm right there, and that's going to hurt someone. So give a bit of spatial awareness. We are going to catch out Neville and have a look inside. And if you have any questions for Neville as well, we'll be happy to answer those. Yeah, cool. We definitely do. Yeah, when can we do that, William? Because we literally have a list an arm long from viewers this morning. 8.30s. We'll be back in 30 minutes time and he can answer anything you need. Okay, cool. Just one question for you quickly, William. I saw at the very beginning you wheeled the bin over from beside the car. Is that because that arm doesn't reach over the car? Oh, do the arms reach over the cars? No, they're not designed to do that. I mean, it will go, if cars parked here, for example, it will have enough reach to get past the car. But we certainly don't promote going out. So you've got to get out and move that bin? Yeah, if the bins are behind cars, yeah, sure. It's only a safe way we can do it. Thanks very much, William. That's one question ticked off, and we've got lots more coming up, so we'll see you in half an hour. See you then. Nice fun. I can think of some, you know, my old Sabaru, for example, I wouldn't mind if they had the arm over that. Right, coming up next, amid a spike in youth crime. Is it time to bring back police pursuits? Our panel discusses this next. You know all right? I'm going to see her again. Final mission, you are pushed beyond your limits. Hold on for dear life. This isn't the game. There's no trophy at the end. You're worthy or you're not. This has been the hardest decision that we've had to make. All new ISA is Australia. Wednesday, 8.30 on 3 and 3 now.

Good to have you watching. It's time to check in with our reporters around the country. Now we're going to start in Ta-Maconu, Auckland. Nats Levy. A-2, the share price has been surging. Describe to us what's behind this. Yeah, T'allof a lover, Mal. It's true. The Cynle producers of A2 are seeing a surge in share prices off the back of the US addressing their baby formula shortage. Now, the baby formula was stripped off US shelves with the main supplier being linked to a bacterial infection and the government has been working on filling the shortage with recent news that Bubbs Australia has shaken hands with the government to get their formula product in. So A2 has put in an application with the FDA to be one of the suppliers and that was announced on Monday causing a surge in share prices. And of course, A2 is hoping to replicate the success that Bubbs Australia has had with Biden tweeting that millions of bottles of infant formula would be supplied into the country seeing a 45% share surge at the close of day on Monday. Yeah, it's a huge surge. Nats Levy, thanks very much in Auckland. We'll head to Wellington now, Tia McDougal. Tia, I feel like we've been Yeah, it's a huge surge. Nat's Levy, thanks very much in Auckland. We'll head to Wellington now, Tehr McDougal. Tear, I feel like we've been speaking to you quite a bit recently about the wild weather, but it continues. Tala for Lava Mal, yes. The first part of the bad wind weather is hitting the desert road with a wind warning in place. People who travel along the desert road are very familiar with wind warnings. There it picks up dust and makes it really a dangerous to drive. So MetService have put the first wind warning there. Secondly moving south we hit the west coast of the Lower North Island. There's large swells and wind warnings in place, especially to those coastal roads. Cars and cyclists travelling along the coastal roads have been told to travel very, very cautiously. Four metre swells are set to hit those roads. And then lastly, at the top of the South Island, Nehurtueca and Tasman, there's a heavy rain warning in place. So the message is cautious commuting, cautious driving to anyone in the lower North Island, regardless of it's the wind, rain or swells hitting your area. Yeah, please take care on the roads, especially down there. Christchurch to Mitch Redmond, the St George's Maternity Ward. A lot of people at the hospital have been keeping an eye on this. When can we expect some kind of announcement? Yeah, good morning, Mel. The fate of St George's Maternity Ward will be known later on today with a decision on the facility's future expected just after 1.30 this afternoon. Now earlier this year, staff were consulted with about the decision to potentially close the facility due to staffing shortages and the facility no longer being financially viable. Now that caused uproar among people living in Christchurch with a petition gathering more than 30,000 signatures to keep this facility open. Now with midwives and facilities already hard enough to come by in Christchurch, staff are worried that the closure of this facility will put unbearable pressure on the public health system. Each year St George's Hospital is contracted by the District Health Board to deliver around 400 babies. So this facility closing would mean 400 soon to be mums will need to be shifted back into the public health system. But the union is expected to be briefed on this just after 10 o'clock this morning with the decision to become public at 1 o'clock. So fingers crossed for a good outcome. We'll keep an eye on that. Thank you very much. Mitch Redman, T. Muldugel and Nats Levy. Thanks very much for joining us around the country today. Yeah, interesting that one. Coming up a bit later on, we're going to be speaking about dating profiles. And this is because one of our producers is getting back into the dating scene that's setting up a profile. Who's that? I'll tell you later. I don't think she'd want to be outed on TV. Well, maybe she does. We better check. She might really want to. Do you want me to start listing them off? I'll just nod if it. Give me a wink. Give me a wink. It's an interesting one though because we, in talking about it, I said I tried Tinder once and I put this photo on and my friend looked and she said, that's an awful photo of you. What are you doing that? And I said, I tried Tinder once and I put this photo on and my friend looked and she said, that's an awful photo of you. What are you doing that? And I said, that's the idea that if you get somebody who matches with you that thinks that you look great at your mind and when you look bad. That's how you ended up with Casper. Under promise, I've delivered. You have a good surprise. Don't set the bar too high. But the other thing I noticed was what's with all these pictures of guys with animals? They're all posing with their fish or dogs. I can explain. And for a lot of guys, that's the only photo they have. So most guys don't take photos like girls do. And when they do take photos, it's to prove how big a fish was. Seriously. It's the only photo they've got. Because the only other photo. Otherwise, they're all with their mates. Shots her tackle. Shuttle down there. Otherwise, they're in a group with their mates at the rugby, aren't they? And you're like, well, I don't know which one it is? But I hope it's not that one. That's right.

Tonight on the hui. 20 years old and fighting a heart condition that killed her twin brother We follow Latisha Porharama's courageous battle The Huy, tonight after News Hub late on three Kitt starts again Morena, good morning, thanks very much for joining us on AM today. It's 25 minutes past 8. Look at this live shot of central Otago, high of 16 degrees in Queensland today, taking 1 hour, three minutes from Wanaka to Queensland, and 25 minutes from Alexander Cromwell. Traffic updates, the actual partner batteries are your local battery expert. 26 after 8, and that means it's time for our panel of the day today. Please welcome News Hub National correspondent Patrick Gow. Good morning. Good morning. And lawyer Chris Patterson. Morning, Chris. Qioram. Morana. Good to have you here. So we heard from the police commissioner this morning. He says they are looking at changing their pursuits policy. It's basically no one's dying from police pursuits. But boy, are people a bit more brazen with the crimes that they're committing, Patty? Yeah, look, I'm actually against the changing of the police pursuits policy. I think if they use that to try and solve the ram road policy out in Auckland here, it'll mean one thing. Kids will die. Kids will die if they change that police pursuit policy. 63 people died in the 10 years leading up to the change. None have died since. If they use it against the ram raids, kids will die. I can tell you the story right now. It'll be four kids in a car wrapped around a traffic island or a pole or something like that out in East Auckland and it'll be a disaster. But the alternative potentially is a dead dairy owner. Well, are ram raids killing dairy owners? I don't know if that's really the issue. Well, you've actually heard the police minister acknowledged it's only a matter of time before one of these things goes south. Yeah, okay, super simple solution by the police to say, well, we'll just chase them, that'll solve the problem. It's actually not, I'm with Patrick on this one. Let's think about the combination. High-powered motor vehicles that have been stolen. Young people, 16, 17, even younger, were no real experience in driving, all hyped up because they've just committed a crime and then the police turn up and then there's a chase on. Sounds like a disaster. Maybe they wouldn't be going, even trying to commit the crime if they knew the cops would chase. I mean, you asked the Herald's interview, one of these 15-year-olds, right, who's done a ram raid, and they said, I've actually got the quote here. Let me read it to you. Because I think it's interesting. He says, we get respect on the streets. Why do you do it? We get respect on the streets, and we know the police won't chase us. Yep, and that's part of it. They know that and they understand it, but when they chase, we've seen in the past, they run, they don't know how to drive. They're so young, their frontal cortex doesn't work, they think they're on PlayStation. We've, we've had this movie, we've seen it before. It ends with kids, wrapped around a power pole. They turn out to be 16, 14. I can write the story right now. One of them's never done anything wrong before. They've got good parents. They should be in care. I can do it for you. You will be covering this on the AM show when it happens. That's why we don't have it. And I noted, actually, that the police commissioner said fine-tuning. I don't think that Andrew Costa wants this kind of blood on his hands, which is what it will be, kids' blood on his hands. And I agree with you, Ron, someone is going to die out there. That's all of our fears. But that person who's going to die has done nothing wrong. You know, where is the message about consequences? What message are we sending society about consequences if we say we are willing to wear a death of somebody who is just working hard trying to earn a living? But we will do that to protect the life of somebody who's made a wrong decision. It's a balancing act, isn't it? Yeah, we'll put some more effort into it. Let's put some more effort into it. Like just saying, hey, we'll chase them. Let's put some more effort. Let's put some more resource into actually engaging with the young people who are involved there. Let's get a more holistic approach of getting the community involved. Let's protect the dairy owners through that way, not through saying, after you've been run over, we'll chase someone. That's ambulance to the bottom of the cliff stuff. Let's move on to another topic. I want to quickly show you this Labour Party ad that we've seen amongst some other ads on the website this week. The Cost of Living Crisis, that's how we'll win this election. This one's authorised by Grant Robertson. And of course, there's a picture there of Chris Luxon. This seems to be an interesting tactic by really focusing on Christopher Luxon there, don't you think? Well, I'll tell you a few things about that ad. The first thing when I look at that, I think it's actually pathetic. I think it's actually quite useless technically as an attack ad. It could actually be a National Party ad. It's not really even attacking him. And it's pretty hopeless. Yeah, it's like, okay, is that National putting that out as a good thing? Or is that a Labor Party ad? So first things first, the junior staffer who's made that thing up last night pull them down, give them a bit more training and I know that they'll be watching this. So there's a advice. It's a useless attack ad. If I was going after Christopher Loxet and they need to because they've let him get way too much momentum, he's getting way too much practice, he's got way too much high in the polls and he's been too much practice. They haven't attacked him early enough. He needs to be attacked like they attack key. He's slippery. I watch him on here. He makes stuff up on the hoof and then he backtracks on it. They need to get that sort of narrative going. I actually think that Labor needs to be attacking him harder and going harder. That attack ad is quite useless. They're scared of him. It's a bit late. He's gotten a lot of momentum and they're worried, but they need better attack ads. Chris, do you think it's fair enough for Loxon to say, you know, we're going to win through the cost of living crisis? Is it fair enough to kind of treat it as a game? Well, it is a political issue. I mean, it's the one thing that affects all New Zealanders is the cost of actually living, you know, and as that keeps going up and interest rates keep going up, September's going to rock around for next year's election fairly quickly, and it's stuff like this that is really going to affect people. So I think that he's on the right track to say, we could win an election based solely on cost of living. If people are hurting enough, then they're going to look for someone who's going to be a better team to run the economy because that will become an election issue. They're politicians, after all, aren't they? They are. It's a sport. Yeah, I mean, it could turn out to be a fact. I mean, National could win the election because it costs a living. I mean, it could turn out to be a fact. They're heading that way. They're heading that way, aren't they? Hey, thanks guys for coming in. Good debate this morning. NewsHub National correspondent Patrick Goward and lawyer Chris Patterson at 28 away from 9. It's now news time. Total for Lava, good morning. It is 832. The police pursuit policy is once again under review with some fine-tuning expected. Police Commissioner Andrew Costa told AM the current policy has saved lives but some tweaks may be needed to deter ram raiders. We are looking at fine-tuning it but it will be in the nature of a fine-tuning if there's any change. The fundamental position lines up with what other jurisdictions are doing and looks like international best practice. The Prime Minister has downplayed the seriousness of China's current presence in the Pacific saying it isn't new. It comes as China signs deals with Fiji, Samoa, Nui and the Solomon Islands, with the goal of securing a region-wide economic deal. While some nations are saying they don't want to get caught in the geopolitical crossfire, Adirn says she isn't worried. And I think we do need to just take a step back and remember that, of course, China's being present in the Pacific and active in the Pacific and across infrastructure projects and built relationships over a number of years. What is happening right now is not new. Perhaps the pace has picked up and the engagement has picked up, but it is not new. It's understood the Pacific will be one of the main topics of discussion when Adirn meets with Joe Biden tomorrow morning. An early morning scuffle between flatmates has caused a large police turnout in Christchurch this morning. Emergency services were called to a fight just after 6 o'clock at a residential property on Dunin Place in Wollstone. Police say one person has been taken into custody and another has minor injuries following the assault. Police remain in the scene. There's cautious optimism. The European Union will come to an agreement on a ban on Russian oil within the week. If passed, it would be the sixth round of sanctions imposed by the EU since the invasion of Ukraine. Member states have met in Brussels with reports indicating all 27 countries agree in principle. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says they're just ironing out the details. This package, we are not there yet, but it has matured for sure. My expectations are low that it will be solved in the next 48 hours, but I'm confident that thereafter there will be a possibility. Hungary has indicated it needs more energy securities before it gives the oil ban its seal of approval. A warehouse fire in Cuba has destroyed over 26 tons of tobacco. The blaze tore through the property incinerating the structure and parts of neighbouring tobacco works. While the cause of the fire remains unknown, authorities say they're already working on the clean-up. Cuba's tobacco industry employs a quarter of a million people in peak season. In sport, Black Caps Veteran bowler Trent Bolt and batter Henry Nichols are both unlikely to take part in the opening test against England. New Zealand has confirmed its 15-man squad with Michael Bracewell added as a 16th man to cover for Nichols who's in doubt as he continues to recover from a calf injury. Bolt who played in the Indian Premier League final yesterday only just arrived in London, putting him in serious doubt for the tested lords. We'll see how he scrubs up, but I guess I've had conversations with Trent leading up into this. It's part of the world and the way it is right now and I guess with the complexity of putting all schedules together and then you obviously have the IPL on top of that. The Chelsea Football Club has officially been sold with the consortium led by American investor Todd Bowley completing the deal. Chelsea was put out for sale in March after previous owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned due to his links to the Russian president. In a statement, Bowley said he was honoured and wanted to make fans proud as he secured the future of the club. The consortium bought the club for $8.2 billion. The proceeds of the sale will be donated to charities supporting victims of the war in Ukraine. That's the very latest from NewsHub. It is 24 to 9. Thanks, Bernardine. We are heading to William soon. He's out with a rubbish truck this morning. If you've got Tuesday Rubbish Day, keep a lookout for him. I've got questions. We also have a list of questions here. If you're fascinated by rubbish trucks like we apparently are, stay with us. It's like, I mean, obviously not quite as exciting as when Mr. Whippy comes down, you get an ice cream. But when you hear the, I always look out the window just to see. I just am interested in what they're doing. And, you know, I also like looking at, you know, the cars behind them. Are they being patient or are they trying to get round? And it's just a bit of excitement on the street, isn't it? Yeah. You might need some hobbies, Ryan. Let's have a look at the weather. The weather. Brought you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. A heavy rainfall and subtropical low bring weather warnings and watches for today. Heavy rain watch in place for Eastern Bay Plenty, northern Gisbon, Tasman, western Motueca and Westland. Fjordland, you don't miss out, you've got a strong wind watch in place. Let's have a look at New Zealand on this Tuesday. Lower South can expect a fine day. High cloud across the region. Oteipote, 19 degrees. Queensland, 16. West Coast rain, possibly heavy and thundery, easing to shards by the afternoon. Milford Sound, 16 degrees, Hokitika, expecting 17. Canterbury and Malbara, it'll be fine and warm, a little bit of clad around, otatahi 20 degrees, Nelson, 17. The lower north will be cloudy, possible showers, the winds that will play havoc, they'll be strong and exposed places. Wellington, 17, Musterton, warmer on 19 degrees. They'll be strong and exposed places. Wellington 17, 17. Musterton warmer on 19 degrees. Central plateau has a little everything. A few showers for most of the region. Possible thunderstorms even hail this morning for New Plymouth. Huanganui 20 degrees. Taupo, little cooler 16. East Coast, any rain should clear by late morning. A cloudy day with light winds. The mercury will hit 20 in Gisbon. 17 is the target for Rotorua. And to the top of Ontario, you can expect a cloudy day with light winds. The mercury will hit 20 in Gisbon. 17 is the target for Rotorua. And to the top of Aalthera, you can expect a cloudy old day. Isolated shawls, there'll be morning fog and keri-kidiroa and thunderstorms for Fungare. O'Kilani, Auckland. Happy Samoa in Language Week. Viranga also 20 degrees today. Thanks very much, Bernardine. We are heading back to William now, who is with Neville in the rubbish truck. And William, we've got some questions for you. Tell us when we can take it away, or are you going to tell us something? Yeah, first of all, Mora, Mel, first of all, I just wanted to say, Neville, thank you for inviting me inside the cab. It's a bit of a childhood dream of mine to get inside a piece of heavy machinery like this. So thank you very much for that. Yeah, shoot away, Mel. We're ready to go, me and Neville. All right. I had a couple of questions. Firstly, what time can they start operating if they are driving the rubbish truck? What time can you start operating when you're doing the rubbish trucks? There are certain areas of Auckland that were able to start quite early. So 6 o'clock is generally a time within an area 5, which is this particular area, on a main road. Otherwise the rest of Auckland will be 7 o'clock in the morning. Wow. Wow, well, there will be a habit. And also he gave me an interesting fact that there are 180 trucks around and they pick up 160,000 bins daily. So just imagine how much waste is there. And that's just in Auckland alone. Next question. Next question. What annoys you the most about driving a rubbish truck? What do people do that really bugs you? What really bugs you when most about driving a rubbish truck? What do people do that really bugs you? What really bugs you when you're driving the rubbish tracks? Say there'd be a few things. Yeah, I think the biggest one is probably the bin placement. Obviously with people putting bins behind cars. So it'll be really helpful, obviously, if you're able to put bins clear of cars. It just makes our job a little bit easier. Oh, Neville, look, I'm going to start doing that from today. So I hope you guys can adopt that one as well. This is a question from one of our viewers. I think it's Sue. Sue says when the bin gets damaged, why does it take so many days or weeks to have it repaired? I don't know whether this is actually an issue for Neville, but he might have an answer. Hey, Suez just wants to know when their bin gets damaged, why does it take so long to get the bin back to them fully equipped again? Unfortunately, I don't have any control over that. You'll obviously need to speak to the council, and they organise all the bin replacements. Okay, thanks. And just to finish, Neville, reiterate what you were saying earlier.

Okay, ma'ano. Welcome back to AIM this morning. It is quarter to nine now. Our partners. Go on. Go on. Welcome back to AIM this morning. It is quarter to nine now. Our partners... Our partner at Khoris have revealed that we're using up more data and internet than ever. We're all on our mobile phones, then throw in laptops, online streaming services and a bit of TikTok, and your internet may be struggling to keep up. So thanks to Khoris, tech expert Kurt Rogers. From Khoris has a new way to measure your data usage and he joins us now. Hi there. Hello. How much are we using? Well, we've actually, we've seen household data usage grow fivefold over the last five years. So five years ago, we hit 100 gigabytes a month as the average. Just recently, we hit 500 gigabytes a month as the average. Just recently we hit 500 gigabytes a month as the average household data usage. So a five-fold increase. And so the thing is you may not be aware that you're using so much and so you might not be quite on the right broadband plan if you keep using more and more and more like that. What's behind that? Well, there's two main reasons. One is there are more and more and more like that. What's behind that? Well, there's two main reasons. One is there are more and more devices. True. And also video. Now it's not just video on streaming TV, but obviously if you're doing Netflix or TV3 on demand, that's going to be using a lot of data, but also social media these days is full of video. Instagram, TikTok in particular, you know, scrolling through your TikTok feed, it just chews up so much data on your home Wi-Fi and that counts for your broadband. The other thing is video is the new thing really is Zoom. So before lockdowns in COVID, not many people were doing video calls. Now I think everyone's doing video calls all the time, so it's become really much the new norm. So all of those things add up. How do we make sure that we do have enough internet to cope with that? Well, one of the things we've done is we've just launched a new data calculator on our website. So if you go to corus.com.nz, look for the data calculator. Takes you a couple of minutes. You put in the number of people in your house, the number of devices, the sorts of things you're doing, and we'll give you an estimate for how much data you need and some hints around what type of broadband might be best for you. Are there some kind of general tips for people if they're thinking about how much broadband they're using? And you've got the kids, you've got, as you say, all those devices, all that video. That's right. And so we try and make broadband simple. I know megabits and gigabytes get really confusing for people, and it's full of technology. So along with the data calculator, we've got a whole bunch of tips and tricks that just try and make it really simple. So you can understand much more about what broadband is, how you use it, just to make sure you're on the right type of broadband and then you can forget about it once you're on the right type. Awesome. Tech expert Kurt Rogers. Thanks very much for being with us and thanks to our show sponsor, KORUS. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. I've always thought that I could do with some more broadband, but then I'm not actually sure what plan I'm even on. People don't even know. Yeah. But I also think, you know, you think, oh, video, I think, oh, I don't use much video. But then I forget, Zoom calls, scrolling through social media, that all counts. Yeah, all ends up.

We'll never fear, we have life coach, Jamin Fraser here to help us with some tips on what to do with your dating profiles. Jamon, thanks very much for joining us. So pictures, should they be the very best pictures of you? Should they be kind of a realistic impression? What should you do? Yeah, well, it's interesting because some of the stats say that if you go a bit too intense, you know, the shirt off look, that it comes across quite needy and that neediness is the weakest and most unattractive way you can position yourself online. So it might sound like that's really confident and very attractive, but the smell of it, neediness, you can smell neediness from a mile away, so you have to find a way to show up secure instead. And what kind of thing then, okay, so if you're not going to post the big shirtless, you know, best photo of yourself, if shirtless is the best photo, what should you be writing about yourself? What do you want to suggest to people? Look, full disclosure, right? So I've been married 23 years. I got married when I was 19, so I've never used a dating app. So my, I'm quoting the work around insecurity and how that affects your language about yourself, the images you use. The most attractive way you could ever be is to be secure in who you are, to know your value and worth, to feel that you are delightful and that another person would be lucky to share your company. And I think that then impacts how you write and the kind of image you use. Rather than the specifics around exactly what words you should use or exactly what picture, do the inner work and it shows up on the outside. And that's, I guess, important too, when it comes to meeting up because you can have these nice conversations on Tinder or wherever and get along famously. But as soon as you actually have to meet in person, you have to keep that confidence up. That's exactly right. And it's not a case of fake it till you make it because you get found out very quickly. And so insecurity seems like an unsolvable problem, but I'm convinced it is our most important problem to solve, especially as adults. So I'm convinced that's the key important problem to solve, especially as adults. So I'm convinced that's the key. You want to be attractive, you want to make this work, then you have to work on your own fear about if you are valuable, if you are worthwhile, and deconstruct some of the stories you've told about yourself about why you wouldn't be attractive. Insecurity is a very interesting point you make there, and I know you've written books about this. So we'd love to talk to you again about that specifically. But for now we have to go Life Coach and author, Jamie Fraser. Thanks very much for your time. Okay, here's what we're going to do very quickly. We've each got our own camera.
