A landmark court ruling will see Gloria Vail facing the most attention to it's experienced in decades.

Barrister Brian Henry, who led the legal challenge, told Hub News Hub live at 8, officials have been failing the community. It's all about where weren't they employees and I don't know how, but the Labor Inspector did a report saying they were not employees, and that gobsmacked me. Members will now be entitled to basic employment rights like working hours, leave and holiday pay. Myeloma New Zealand is calling out the health minister over not releasing an independent Pharmac review into the cancer and its treatment. The group claim a final report from a review panel has been sitting with Minister Andrew Little since February. Miloma New Zealand Chief Executive, Dr Ken Romeril, believes the nature of the interim report. He can only assume the final findings contain recommendations that the minister finds unpalatable. He says the review source submitsers overwhelmingly calling for changes to the Pharmac model and processes which would require changes to the organisation's statutory objectives. Almost 1,000 Auckland households are waking up without internet and could be disconnected for much of the morning. Fibre broadband has been out for 969 homes across Teatatatu in West Auckland since just after 5 on Tuesday. A note on the course website says technicians are working on the fault and the internet should be back on by 10 a.m. almost 17 hours after the outage. The network issue is reportedly due to the fibre feeder cable being accidentally cut. The United Nations believes there could be thousands of unreported deaths in Ukraine's occupied cities. The country's east has been hit hard overnight with Russia conducting storming operations on the as-of-style steel plant in Mariupol. The United Nations' latest figures indicate 3,300 civilians may have been killed in the invasion since late February. But officials are warning the estimates are conservative. In terms of the whole country, we have been killed in the invasion since late February. But officials are warning the estimates are conservative. In terms of the whole country, we have been working on estimates, but all I can say for now is that it is thousands higher than the numbers that we have currently given to you. The growing death toll is heaping pressure on Sweden and Finland, with both countries expected to announce in the coming days whether they'll join NATO. The Queen's absence has been felt at the opening of the British Parliament for the first time since 1963. 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth was forced to pull out of the event due to ongoing mobility issues. Instead, the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and Prince William took centre stage. Without addressing his mother's absence, Charles wasted no time in getting to business. My Lords and members of the House of Commons, Her Majesty's Government's priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families. The speech set out a total of 38 bills, including measures to revam Britain's high streets and crack down on illicit finance. In sport, Black Caps bowler, Carl Jameson's sweary of England's class heading into the three-match test series starting next month. The English have lost their last nine test matches.

They've got some world-class players in their team and, yeah, I guess that pass form doesn't really count for much in terms of my eyes. Like I said, they've got some world-class players. They're a very, very good team and especially at home as well. So, look, it's going to be a big challenge for us. The first test gets underway on the 2nd of June at Lords. Finally, in sports, some good news on the Warriors front. They need some, don't they, with Captain Tohu Harris to make his return after nearly a year on the sidelines. The skip has been named to start in this weekend's NRL clash against the South Sydney Rabbit toes, his first match since suffering a serious knee injury in July last year. Harris will swap back into the second row and lead the team for the first time since being officially appointed captain. All right, let's take a look at the weather for Wednesday.

Staff will go holidays and work extra hours to cover for their colleagues who are isolating. Many may be feeling close to burnout, but just how overworked are we? Here with the data is Infometrics Chief Economist Brad Olson. Good morning, Brad, so lovely to have you in studio. Welcome. Are we overworked? Well, we're certainly worried that we're getting that way. We know that people have been working a huge amount throughout the COVID-19 pandemic over the last few years to try and keep the economy ticking over. We know that the numbers are suggesting that things are in an all right position, but you worry that with so many people off work, we're sort of burning everyone out, we're burning the candle very much at both ends to keep the lights on. And what surprised us is that although we were seeing 300,000 odd people at any one time during the Omicron peak out of work, not able to go to work either with COVID-19 or having to isolate at home, we actually saw that the amount of work done in the economy was only 0.2% lower than normal. And that surprised us. It said that somehow we'd been able to keep the economy running with so many people out of work. Digging through the numbers, what we've very much seen is that other people who were still employed were still in the office, they were very much trying to pick up the slack and keep things moving. But you do worry that you can only do that for so long because at some point people are going to be too burnt out to continue. There's almost some contradictory numbers in there, though, aren't there, that if it only drops by 0.2%, you know, is that a bit of a concern? Well, I think it's the sort of thing where you might be able to do that in the short term. You know, you can get people to, you know, work extra hours and pick up those odd jobs and similar for a bit. But if you do that consistently, people are just not going to have the energy to continue. And I think what was surprising is we know that there was an obvious increase in the number of people off with COVID-19. You know, I think between 40 and 70% increases either with COVID-19 or having to isolate. But you do look forward. We know that we're having a real challenge around the brain drain and actually finding talent. So at the moment, if we're trying to use our current workforce and squeeze absolutely everything out of them, the worry is, well, do they have the ability to take time off to recharge, or are we just sort of making them run and run and run until they collapse? So what happens when they come back and they decide they want actually to take their annual leave or a break, extra pressure on employers? Absolutely, and that's the sort of thing where at some point we are pushing closer and closer in my mind to breaking point where the economy goes, look, we've got a lot of work to do but there's just not the people to do it either because they're off isolating or because everyone says, look, I need a break at at some point we know that some analysis of leave data from Australia points towards a 24% increase in the amount of leave that people have we know that are storing that up for longer because well they haven't been able to take it of course you know you've had lockdowns and similar you haven't been able to travel quite as much but increasingly everyone's going if I take a break now I I might be leaving, you know, the team out of it because they're not going to have enough resource to keep going. That affects the entire workflow. They're entitled to leave, but again, we talk about the crunch on the employers, but also the workforce in general. People won't, you know, restaurants, we know, they're understaffed at the moment. Is that going to be a long-term effect on the market, do you think? Well, that's certainly the worry without, in our minds, the ability to bring quite as many people back into the country, but also with more people leaving at the moment than coming in in general. That's a big, big shift. And at the same time as that we know there's so much intense competition. It's not just any one or two sectors. It's just about every sector is crying out for workers, wanting to try and find those staff members. And so very much the worry is you've got so many people who are absolutely tearing at the bit trying to get work done because there's so much coming in the front door that at some point you go, is this actually manageable for New Zealand? Are we overworking ourselves? Are we starting to put ourselves in that real pressure cooker environment where at some point something must give? And that's, I guess, the worry that we're now in a position where we've kept things going. That's absolutely true. The economy's in a good place. But how much more stretch has the economy got left in it? On the flip side, though, as we come to grips with the virus and perhaps we get that herd immunity, we're not isolating for the seven-day periods, it may write itself those numbers in time. Will it be a slow burn, though? I think it will be a slow burn. I mean, that's certainly hopeful that we see better things coming through. But we know that at the moment, by our estimates, there's still over 100,000 people on average that are either isolating with COVID or who are working from home or staying at home and isolating. So those numbers sort of haven't yet come back to the more normal levels or seen more people be able to get back into the office to the degree that I think we'd need to see to have that activity come back up. So we are seeing better things, if you will, but certainly the pressure is on for workers, for businesses to keep things running. And so the economic motor is very much ticking over, but you do worry if we've sort of got enough in the tank to get us the full air to the end, because at the moment we are very much running the motor red-hot. We do not want employees limping to the finish line because we all wind down to Christmas on a normal year, and we know the last two years have been anything but normal. Infometrics, Chief economist Brad Olson, lovely to have you in studio, thanks for your expertise. Well, two, international news now, and the German foreign minister will make her first visit to Ukraine. It comes after criticism of Germany being too hesitant in providing military aid. The German president had previously offered to visit but was told not to due to his close ties with Russia's foreign minister. For more on this, I'm joined by AM Europe reporter Elizabeth. Good morning to Elizabeth. Yeah, good morning. So essentially, I think to start things off, a trip to Ukraine from a representative from an EU country is nothing unusual. So yesterday, Germany's foreign minister did visit Ukraine and she did hold a press conference in a town which has been investigated for potential war crimes. And she basically came out and said, you know, we can see the atrocities that are happening here and we do stand by and we do support Ukraine. But I guess the controversial thing here is that it has taken Germany this long to get to Ukraine. So essentially every other country in the EU has pretty much been to Ukraine, shown their support, showing their solidarity with them. But it has taken Germany this long to get there. And essentially it comes down to a few things. There's a lot of diplomatic tension between Ukraine and Germany at the moment for numerous reasons. The first is that Germany continues to buy, was continuing to buy Russian oil and gas, which, you know, Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky basically came out and said, Germany, you are one of the reasons that Russia has all this money for war because you keep buying their gas. And I guess the other reason is that Ukraine thinks that Germany was far too slow to come to the party over support and initially sending kind of weaponry to Ukraine. And I guess so coupled with all of that has taken them a long time to get there. But it is surprising that they have sent their foreign minister and not the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz. It is a little unusual and there is no kind of clear reason as to why they've done that yet. But you're funny that you mentioned this in the intro that they were, you know, back in April, the German president, and actually Germany has a president, not everyone knows that, but German president Walter Steinmeyer did offer to visit Kiev, you know, way back in April with a whole bunch of other European leaders, but was basically told, yeah, don't bother because of his really close ties to Russia when he was foreign minister. So basically they're saying, you know, Germany, you're in the pockets of Putin and you've got a lot to prove before you can kind of say that you are on our side. Yeah, they're treading very carefully with that one for sure. A lot of talk about the Queen in the status of her health, Elizabeth. She watched her son, Charles, open parliament, another big event missed by the 96-year-old. Yeah, that's right. So much like New Zealand has Budget Day, the UK has Queen's speech, which is essentially a day where the Queen comes to Parliament and kind of stands up before Parliament and gives a speech and sets out the priorities for the government for the rest of the year alongside the Prime Minister. And, yeah, the big news out of the UK today was that she was unable to attend, and that her son, Prince Charles, who was also next to mind of the throne, stepped in and had to give that speech. And I guess the kind of significance of this is that this is the first time since 1963 that she has missed the Queen's speech. That's almost 50 years. And it's only the second time in her entire 70 years of rain that she has had to miss it. So, yeah, that is big news. And I guess, you know, she is 96. so it doesn't really come as a surprise that she's had these mobility issues. But it is one of numerous events that she's had to pull out of over the last few weeks, whether that's due to sickness or, you know, just something like mobility issues, which is really normal for a 96-year-old. But, yeah, it is raising questions, I think, just about an overall state of health at this time. But it is probably worth noting that right up until Monday evening, so in Germany at the moment or in Europe at the moment, it's Tuesday evening. So up until last night, she was ready to attend, and it was a last minute pull-out, and Buckingham Palace has come out with a statement saying, you know, she is fine. It's just something that happens, and she is ready to attend other routine appointments and events this week. Which should be a cup of tea in front of the TV because she is 96, she's had COVID, she's got naughty children who can't behave. Goodness me. What she needs is a beer, but maybe not one in Germany because the price is being hiked there and it's not just a small price hike. Yeah, that's right. So it's a really sad day for Germany. So essentially, in Germany you'd actually say it's super shudder. It's really unfortunate that Germany could be seeing a 30% spike in the price of beer, which is huge. I mean, if you ask anyone what Germany is known for, it's beer, and rightly so, because they're really, really, really good at making it. So essentially, yeah, because of the rising cost of inflation everywhere around the world, including in Europe, we are going to see a spike in the price of beer, and it could be as high as to see a spike in the price of beer. And it could be as high as 30%, according to the German Brewers Association. And the fact that Germany has a rules association is really funny in itself, I think. But to put it into perspective for you guys at home, you know, a pint of beer in Germany would cost about four euros, maybe a little less, maybe a little more. But that's about six New Zealand dollars. So it is super cheap. And I think if they were to spike it would have a run on effect on tourism in the country. Goodness me, wouldn't it indeed. I need the big things. I am Europe reporter Elizabeth White lovely to chat.

With over 50 years combined experience, Sam and Mike are the ones to watch. Breaking news tonight, it's been confirmed. Every night for every update. Going live now to Wellington. Deanna, what's happening? Winners of the best news coverage for three years running with New Zealand's best reporter, Michael Marr. New information has come to light. Join us. Newsup, live at 6, on 3 and 3 now. Norma, Haemey, you with Aim Early. It is seven minutes to six. Time now to check in with our reporters around the country. And first up, it is good morning to Tia McDougal in Wellington. And another big fail from our healthcare system, Tia. Yeah, the hospitals in the Lower North Island don't seem to have a very good reputation for getting patients through the emergency department well. Palmerston North couldn't do it in six hours and Fangare was having, sorry, Funganoi was having some issues earlier this year and the latest hospital is Wairarapa. It's been found that they have been unable to get many patients through the emergency department in the standard threshold, which is six hours. They let 26% of patients stay for longer than six hours, and that's the worst time they've had since 2016. So the DHP has commented saying that COVID has put in a lot of extra measures that they've never had before, but overall, not a good wrap for them. Yeah, not great numbers, and of course you feel for the healthcare workers who are doing their best. Thanks to you. Let's head to Ulta-ahe Christchurch, Mitch Redmond. Good morning to you. A new home for some wastewater down the line. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. Residents in the Banks Peninsula Town of Devotional, consultation has opened for them on the future of their wastewater treatment centre. Now, for years, wastewater has been pumped into Akaroa Harbour. However, the Christchurch City Council is agreeing with Ngaitahu that continuing to do that would be offensive. Now the council's proposed plan is somewhat of a unique one. The Akuroa Golf Club has agreed that they will take on this treated wastewater to irrigate their golf course. And looking at the finances of it is an economically viable option, costing around $13 million, making this the council's favourite option. Consultation is open until the 7th of June, but if avoiding the water on the golf course wasn't a good enough reason already, potentially this is an even better one now too. This is the right kind of water hazard, isn't it? Irrigate those greens. Thanks for that, Mitch. Let's now head to Perry Wilton and Auckland. And we're playing a game this morning, Perry. We're not playing where's Wally? It's where's the wallaby? That's exactly right, Bernardine. Authorities have been sent on a wild goose chase. They were notified of a wallaby sighting near Dargaville on Babylon Coast Road on Sunday the 1st of May and that sparked a multiple agency response local iwi dock and council contractors were deployed to find this pest there aren't any wallabies in the area so the sighting of one caused some alarm they scoured 500 hectares of land to find it they They turned up empty-handed, saying that it was probably a hare. I'm not going to lie. We've got a theme going on here, Perry. It was possums. Yesterday, cats, and today it's wallabies. Basically, you're our resident Dr. Doolittle, I think. I'm not sure how this has happened. There's plenty going on, but this is what has hit overnight. We are loving it. Thank you, Dr Perry and Tia and Mitch. That were our AM reporters around the motto. That was AM early. Time now. It's coming up to three minutes to six."}
