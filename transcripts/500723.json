One of New Zealand's most controversial murder investigations has now been deemed a miscarriage of justice. Burnout, conflicts of interest and increased workloads the challenges facing our rural police officers are laid bare. And a shock you turn from the Blackburn's coach, Glenmore quits after a damning report into culture at the elite level of women's rugby. most controversial murder convictions is said to have it overturned. Alan Hall was found guilty of killing Arthur Easton in Auckland 36 years ago. Now Crown law has accepted he was likely wrongfully convicted of the Grove murder. Kelly Callaghan today spoke with Alan Hall. Alan Hall walking alongside his brothers and soon to be free of a 36-year label as a convicted murderer. Oh, raped. Harry. Convicted for the 1985 murder of Auckland Man Arthur Easton. He was sent to jail for a crime he has always maintained he didn't do. He's since been in and out of prison, spending a total of 18 years behind bars. That was a moment that I just went, what? 36 years of this and then, boom, we'll run. Now his lawyers say the Crown has deemed his case a miscarriage of justice and will not seek a retrial. The case will now go to the Supreme Court to have his conviction formally quashed. We'll wait and see what they make of our submissions, Crown Law's submissions, but we're hopeful of getting Ellen exonerated as soon as we possibly can. A diagnosis of autism meant Alan couldn't provide a consistent alibi and account of what happened. News Hub Nation investigations two years ago also revealed other major breakthroughs, including the claim witness statements of the offender's description, were altered. Turned this case around, actually. I believe it's the starting point that turned this around. Hall was recalled to prison in 2012 after it was claimed he breached parole conditions. He was released again just last month and is focused on his second chance at life with the murder victim in his thoughts. What we have to look at is Arthur Eastern. In the way, the police handle his murder in the Eastern family. Nobody's talking about them. There are the true victims here. Victims who have no one to hold to account after 36 long years. Okay, well Kaylee's with us now live at the desk. And Kaylee, what do police have had to say about this today? Well, Mitch, police have already started a review of the investigation into Arthur Easton's murder. They're saying an important part of that would be focused on what information was assessed as relevant, who made that assessment and what was done with the information after that. Now, when we asked police, will they reopen the investigation, they had no comment to make. But talking to the whole family today, they want that investigation reopened so that finally the right person is held to account. More to come then. Kali, thank you for the updates. An investigation has been launched after a person died in a house fire in Dunedin last night. Fire crews attended the blaze in Kensington shortly after 10pm. One person was found dead at the scene. the fire is being treated as unexplained. Meanwhile, police are appealing for witnesses to a fatal crash in Queenstown. The accident happened on Kingston Road at Jack's Point shortly after six last night. One person died and another was airlifted to Christchurch Hospital in a critical condition. This takes the Easter holiday road toll to two. Meanwhile, there's concern a declining number of rural cops is leaving officers burnt out. A police officer has told NewsHub that they're struggling to keep up, his new figures show rural crime is increasing. Alexa Cook has this exclusive report. During the day, it's a quiet, rural, wider, upper road. But at nighttime, it's dangerously busy with people illegally shooting deer and farm animals from their youths. It's probably the busiest most poached road in possibly even New Zealand, I should think. Criminals take the locked farm gates off their hinges to hunt the private properties, killing cattle, deer and pigs. We see the spotlights waving around the hills and hear gunshots going off. What we do find is butchered and half-bitcher cattle beasts around the side of the road. And when Georgie and Ben Lutcheon ask the poachers to leave, abuse and threats are hurled at them. To break your legs and burn your house down and all that stuff, it hasn't happened yet. And you get used to it. They're not alone. Figures from Federated Farmers show rural crime has risen by 11% in the past five years. And rural theft claims at FMG insurance are up 19% on 2010. This rural police officer who wants to remain anonymous told News Hub the number of rural cops has declined. We've changed his voice to protect his identity. Rural areas are really, really lacking in numbers. They all tend to be in the metropolitan areas. While the numbers of police are increasing, in rural areas, it's actually dropping. Since 2010, there's been a national increase of nearly 1,500 police officers. But numbers have fallen in some regions. In Hawkes Bay, it's dropped from 243 to 230. In the Wadarapa, it's fallen from 76 to 72. And the number of police in small stations across the country is down by six, declining while our regional populations grow. Are there fewer rural cops now than there used to be? I don't think so, but no, I haven't got those numbers for you. Our rural staff are exceptional. Permanently staff stations have also declined from 311 in 2010 to 272 last year, and 65 stations have closed. The staffing numbers have stayed the same. It may be that we've just moved staff around, but the service is exactly the same. This rural cop disagrees. We really struggle rural. I personally don't think rural communities get the service they deserve. News Hub can reveal there's been more than 1,100 complaints and 1,700 allegations about small police stations since 2010. It was these complaints that led to a policing review from the watchdog, revealing 12 key issues, including burnout, a lack of support, resourcing of smaller stations, conflicts of interest, and the safety of police officers, especially when there's no phone service. Those are the sorts of challenges that need to be faced by police and need to get better. He also found that NZ police has not placed enough importance on its rural policing teams. I don't think there is, or has been to date at least, and that was borne out in much of the information that we got. This rural cop says morale is low and police bosses fail at mental health prevention. It's quite easy to burn out. I don't think it's until someone falls over and says, I've got an issue that it's addressed. The IPCA chair is backing the call for an increase in rural cops. I personally think we could have more. And many farmers aren't even reporting crimes when they happen. A recent Federated Farmers survey found that 31% of respondents didn't tell police when an incident occurred. They've just got so little faith that if they call police, someone will be there for them. I would like to see more rural cops, just generally around. To prevent poachers from shooting their stock. Come here. Later. Come up. Alexa Cook, News Hub. Just days after receiving support from New Zealand rugby to continue, Glenn Moore has resigned as the Black Fern's coach. The 62-year-old has quit only months out from a Home World Cup that comes after accusations by veteran hooker to Kudanata Airangamate sparked a damning review into the Blackburn's culture. You know, I probably don't think that I've been doing the best job that I possibly can do because of those distractions and then sort of, you know, weighing it all up and can see things will carry on a little bit yet. And Glenn Moore sat down with our rugby reporter, Olly Ritchie. You can see more of that interview later on in News Hub Sport. What's our first weekend at the orange traffic light setting and Kiwis right around the country have been out making the most of their freedom. The eased COVID-19 restrictions which started just in time for the long weekend has come as a huge relief for those in the hospitality sector. Layton Haikle has more. Indoor, unmasked and enjoying some Easter family fun. This is the new reality under the orange traffic light setting. So good. So good. I love it. I rather green, but it's still good. It's real free, yeah. And although summer's behind us, the sun was still out, making it the perfect day to spend at the beach, on the water, bombing into Wellington's harbour, or just strolling the streets. It's just such lovely weather. It's great to be out. It's nice to see everybody else out and about as well. Fantastic, and it's easing up, finally. A sentiment echoed by those in hospitality. Tonight will be the night, I'm sure it'll be pumping. That's because dance floors are back. Restaurants in bars no longer need to follow the seated, separated and single server rules. For workers at places like Auckland's sole bar, it makes life a lot simpler. Having people that are able to come in, just have a drink, have a stand at a leaner, you know, not having to run around enforcing all of these rules all the time, it's definitely going to take a lot of time off our hands, that's for sure. I don't think people, the general public, realise what a difference it is for most bars between red and orange. It's like night and day. But for nightclub owner Matt Georgianson, it may have come too late. If I had to pay all my debts tomorrow, that'd be the end of me. The hospitality sector is hoping there's no turning back so businesses can stay open and we can stay on track to green. Oh, fingers crossed. I mean, I just really don't want to have to go back to any of that stuff. Hospitality needs to just get back to normal. After a crazy few years, cheers cheers to the long weekend and our new normal under Orange. Well, Leighton's at the Auckland Viaduct for us tonight, Leighton, are people making the most of the eased restrictions? They are, Mitch. There's a really nice vibe down here on the waterfront tonight, and there has been all the day, in fact. A lot of people make their way out of Auckland over the Easter long weekend, but there is still a large number of people who stayed and are spending their nights out in town. They're really lapping up the newfound freedom that comes with the orange settings. Now, hospitality businesses we spoke to today said despite the fact that they have to shut up shop a little bit earlier tonight, they think it's a good way to ease back into these orange settings. Some good news there, Lakin. Thank you. One news hub reporter, Keisha Brownlee, is at the Riverside Market in Christchurch. Kasha, what's it like down there? Well, it's been steady all day here, Mitch, but in the last few hours it's really started to fill up because now under orange it actually can fill up. A lot of places are booked out, and bar owners are really cramming in the tables. But the hospitality sector is realistic that the easing of these restrictions isn't going to be the major boost to business they so desperately need overnight. There's still a lot of face masks around and people are still anxious to go out while COVID is still circulating and it's just as well as a warm evening tonight because a lot of people have told me they're opting to dine outdoors. They don't want to go outside and risk catching the virus. Now it is Easter Sunday tomorrow so places do need to be closed before midnight and while the celebrations will be cut short, there's always next weekend. It certainly does look like fun. Kasha Brownlee live from Riverside Market in Christchurch. Well the Prime Minister is said to take off on her first trip overseas since COVID arrived on our shores more than two years ago. She's off to Singapore and Japan with a jam-pack schedule made even more high stakes by the hefty COVID restrictions. Political reporter Amelia Wade will be following the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's recently been saying, Hiro Mai. I'm about to say Matéwa. The PM's's recently been saying, hi, Rima. And about to say, Mata Y, why, the PM's off on a post-pandemic OE after checking on her passport. I think mine have all expired. All sorted now. Good job, because there's quite a bit to do. There is a lot rammed in, and that's for good reason. We want to get great bang for Buck for New Zealand from this visit. The first stop on the four-day trip is Singapore for official meetings with the president and their Prime Minister at the Astana, a gala dinner at the epic gardens by the bay and a trip to the port. Then onto Japan to decorate pavlovers with Zespri, hit up a renewable energy event, meet the new president, check out the cookie time store, show off Kiwi Rugby and promote New Zealand at the embassy. As you can see from the program, there's a lot of activity. All that while jumping through logistical COVID hoops, including a super sensitive PCR test to get into Japan, which could leave the PM stuck halfway. There's a possibility, and so no, I'm not anxious about it. It's just a reality of travel. Of course, you'll actually have to make it to Asia first, getting there in one of our notoriously shoddy defense force 757s. Even with commercial airlines from time to time, you'll have disruptions. All this effort worth it for Ardennes after two years without overseas gripping grins. Nothing beats face to face, particularly when you're looking to grow new partnerships. Especially given how much the geopolitical landscape has changed, China will be top of the agenda for meetings. We'll share from our perspective that we are in an increasingly contested region that does put pressure on the region. Ukraine and the global response to it also front of mind. It's not the case that what happens in Europe is relevant only to Europe. But this trip won't just be about the PM. In tow are a team of top delegates, including the CEOs of Fontera and Zespri, also keen to spread the word New Zealand's open again. We're back in business. This trip is go, go, go, and we'll see the Prime Minister using her international stardust from the COVID response to promote Atearoa as a safe place to visit. There'll be international interviews, photo-ups, pavlover cuttings, and even a catch-up with her old exchange student. The Prime Minister is starting off her massive year of travel with a bang and a fair few COVID tests to boot. Amelia Wade, news up. Another 30 people have died with COVID-19 over the past two days. The Ministry of Health revealing the latest figures for today and for Good Friday. That takes our total death toll to 576. Hospitalisations are down to 500. That's now less than half the peak. And cases are also continuing to decline, fewer than 14,000 across the past two days combined. Meanwhile, people travelling over the Easter holiday break are reminded to ensure their vaccinations are up to date. Health correspondent Lucy Warhurst talked to three young people in West Auckland doing their bit in the fight against COVID-19. Meet New Zealand's youngest COVID-19 vaccinators. I'm Breeze, I'm 17 and I'm a vaccinator. I'm Telmo Kera Heppi. I'm 18 and I'm a vaccinator. I'm Thai, Haramawat. I'm 16 and I'm a vaccinator. When I was at school, my job was delivering newspapers, but these Rangitahi are a different. I'm 18 and I'm a vaccinator. I'm Thai, Haramowat. I'm 16 and I'm a vaccinator. When I was at school, my job was delivering newspapers. But these rangatahi are doing something extraordinary. After volunteering at Tefano or Waipareira vaccination centre during lockdown, they were inspired to step up. We're kind of like, oh, can we learn how to vaccinate as well? Because we learn everything else. So we're like, oh, might as well start that too. They got the support of the trust and their parents. My first one was our boss Jolie, and I was more scared than hers. My first vaccination was my mum. I think because we had heaps of medical support as well, and everyone was like supervising us. It was really cool, actually. It wasn't long before they were running their own youth Vax events and took over the trust's social media accounts. I think for younger people getting vaccinated, it's good for them to see someone of their own age and being Māori felt more comfortable with rangatahi, being there with them and vaccinating them. Now they've administered so many doses they've lost count. I think, bro, how was that? I'd say around 10,000 altogether. All of us have done over a thousand, probably. Probably 2,000 maybe. Each of you? Yeah. You've done 1,000. Oh my good. probably 2,000 maybe. Each of you? Yeah. You've done thousands. Oh my goodness. Time, Haremah Watts, now wants to study to become a doctor. Being in the medical field was always in the back of my head, but I wasn't too sure. So then being around it and then seeing it happen every day and then actually getting to do it just, yeah, it helped a lot. Rangitahi, looking after the health of Rangetahi and the whole community. Lucy Warhurst, News Hub. Well, Mikeston now with a look at today's weather, and did that rain help the paddocks in the South Mike? Certainly did, Mitch. Not often Southland is hanging out for rain, but they certainly need it. Milford Sound got 86 millimetres, and Southland got a helpful 5 to 10 millimeters. Meanwhile, Hastings had the days high of 26 degrees. Now my advice is make the most of tomorrow if you're in the North Island things are about to change with a heavy rainwatch in place. I'll have all the details after sport. Don't like the sound of that. Thank you though, Mike.

The SBCA investigated the horse's condition 15 months ago, but at the time was satisfied the owner had not breached the Animal Welfare Act. But after a new complaint, the mayor was seized the owner had not breached the Animal Welfare Act. But after a new complaint, the Mayor was seized and taken to a vet. The New Lives Animal Rescue Group says it had to be euthanized overnight. The group says the SPCA should have acted sooner. Russia has threatened to carry out fresh strikes on Ukraine's capital, Kiev, and warns of unpredictable consequences of other countries continue to supply weapons. The United States, meanwhile, has back claims that Ukrainian missiles were what sank a prized Russian warship in the Black Sea. Moscow had denied the claims. But a warning, Chris Livesey's report from CBS contained some distressing images. It was the flagship of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea, but tonight it's sitting at the bottom of it, along with supersonic missile launchers and the Kremlin's pride. The Moskva was once the terror of Ukraine's coast that infamously threatened these Ukrainian soldiers in the first days of the war, only to be rebuffed with expletives. The Pentagon confirms the ship was struck by Ukrainian-made missiles that have now scared the rest of Russia's fleet away. But Russia is still striking by land and by air, firing three missiles at the capital Keeve. This, as Russia continues to pull back its ground forces after failing to capture it, leaving behind blood-stained boot prints in its wake. The sea of the holes, the scale of holes. Ukrainian lawmaker Alexei Han Chorenko has come to the village of Havronshina to see for himself. A family of five allegedly gunned down as they tried to flee, the youngest, only two years old. A stroller for a baby. Stroller. Oh my God, look at that. And this baby was killed. Yeah. I have son, my own son is three years old. It's so hard. I mean, you can see there's food in there. Yuri Patsan is a local farmer. You live right there. He says he witnessed a Russian armored vehicle opened fire with high caliber explosive rounds, even though the car bore a sign in the back window that read children. Yuri says he tried to save them, but they died in his arms. All he could do was bury them. We're not dogs like the Russian soldiers, he says. Once the Russians left, he and the Ukrainian police exhumed the bodies for investigation. From what you know, from what you've seen, does this constitute a war crime? Yes, it's definitely war crime. Because without any reason, civilians were killed. The world should know that it is not fake. The world should know who is Russian regime. Who is Putin? Well, back home now, and the number of birds with avian botulism has doubled this year, leaving council workers in Taamaki Makoto, Auckland with hundreds of dead birds to pick up. The disease fosters in watering holes, and a warmer and longer summer has seen thousands of birds infected. Kethiki Masalamani has the story. Sitting still unable to move. This duck is paralysed from the faint up. They will look like they want to move, but they actually can't. Veterinarian Liz Murdoch has been treating waterfowl for botulism for years and says this season has been one of the worst. It started about November, the previous season, and this year it started somewhere around August, September, so we have an extra month, and it's just been non-stop, pretty much. The paralysis means birds are prone to predator attacks, parasites, and drownings, after they eat a toxin produced by the botulism bacteria, which thrives in warm water and made worse by feeding them bread. And it's still pretty warm, even in autumn. We think that's a big reason that we've had more birds this year with botulism. Bianca Atlas says bird care has treated 600 birds so far, double that of the last summer season. It's mostly ducks, geese and swans that are affected, but bird cases this year that spread to native species too. While just a handful of birds remain receiving intensive treatment earlier this year, these cages were full. At the peak of the outbreak in January, several of the birds were caged together for emotional support. Vets provide the birds with fluids and even physical therapy. So this little guy has been with us for about two weeks now and he's just starting to come around. And good news, with treatment, 95% of birds survive. We just urge anyone who sees a bird and they suspect that they may be suffering from botulism to bring them to us as soon as you can. So these little guys can get back to doing what they do best.

Tensions continue to rise across Israel and the Palestinian territories. Over the past few weeks, 25 Palestinians have died in a wave of military operations by Israeli forces in the West Bank. In Israel, 14 people have been killed in attacks carried out by Palestinian assailants. And overnight, more than 150 Palestinians were injured as Israeli forces stormed the Alaksa Mosque in Jerusalem. Channel 4's Kami Naziriam reports. One of the holiest places in the Umer, the entire Islamic world, inside the Al-Axa compound in East Jerusalem. Halfway through Ramadan, scenes that will shock followers of many faiths. Mayhem in a place of worship. For this is also the start of the Jewish holiday of Passover and for Christians' Easter weekend. Dates which coincide only once every 33 years. The land here is venerated by all three of these major world religions. Shortly after dawn and potentially in breach of international law, Israeli riot police had entered and then fought with worshippers inside. Israel said they wanted to remove stones and rocks they'd been told had been stockpiled by youths to throw at security forces. Dozens of Palestinians were arrested. Hundreds more have been injured. Around 40 people have now been killed across Israel and the Palestinian territories. As tensions have risen in the run-up to what should be a time for religious observance and contemplation. The scenario that has plagued Jerusalem for generations has once again flared up. What chance a quick return to something, anything, approximating normal life. Prince Harry and his wife Megan have made their first public appearance in Europe since they gave up formal royal titles and moved to the United States two years ago.

Our ability to forecast the likelihood of future earthquakes in New Zealand is becoming more accurate with research into a rock many of us have in our backyard. Kasha Brownley finds out why you may never look at grey-wacky in quite the same way again. Most of us have these in our garden. Grey-wacky is everywhere in New Zealand. Most of us wouldn't take a second glance. All rocks are not the same. For Carolyn Bolton, though, it's a rock that has important secrets to reveal. It's these rocks that start the earthquakes that we've been feeling lately. That's because an earthquake is caused by a slip on a fault and some of its impact is determined by the types of rocks in the fault. Earthquakes and greywacky tend to start at a single point at depth, but as they come up to the surface, they tend to branch out and use lots of pre-existing planes of weakness in the rock. It's those weaknesses that caused a record 22 different faults to rupture at the surface during the 7.8 magnitude Kaikoda earthquake in 2016. It's kind of grey, it's kind of monotonous, and it's also very strongly deformed mean that it's hard to work with. It's made up of a mixture of sandstone and shale. For years and years, people ignored it. Until now. EQC has funded research to correct the gap in knowledge. We have a really fantastic outcrop. It's got some underpinning science and information that will help inform us how faults behave and how earthquakes occur. Researchers put grey-wacky into machines to replicate earthquakes. I measure things like how strong the rocks are, what temperature the earthquakes happen at, and actually how fast the rocks move. This helps to explain why New Zealand has multi-fault earthquakes and how a quake in one region can have a knock-on effect. When one fault ruptures, it places an added stress on another fault. And we need to understand how those stress interactions sort of accelerate the timing of the next earthquake or actually decelerate. Carolyn's research has helped validate other data we already have of Wellington quakes, helping scientists to understand why they're happening and where. We will never be able to predict exactly when earthquakes will happen, but this information will help us better plan for them, people who live near faults, land use and better buildings. So look again at that boring grey rock. It's an important piece of the puzzle that makes up New Zealand's complex fault lines. and better buildings. So look again at that boring grey rock. It's an important piece of the puzzle that makes up New Zealand's complex fault lines. Kasha Brownlee, News Hub.

Climb into adventure with the new Suzuki Jimney and News Hub Sport. Glenn Moore feels he had little choice but to step down as Blackthurn's coach as the fallout from a review into his team's culture and high-performance environment threatened to overshadow the side's World Cup campaign. Moore was initially retained by New Zealand rugby, but has made the call to stand down, wary his ongoing involvement would be too much of a distraction for a team eyeing back-to-back World Cup victories. Moore sat down with rugby reporter, Ollie Ritchie. The last five months have been some of the most difficult of Glenn Moore's coaching career. Today, it came to a head, standing down as Blackfern's coach, following a scathing review of the side he led for six and a half years. It just had the ability to continue to distract me and I wanted the team to have the best opportunity to win. The review was sparked by Tukurana Ariramaate's social media post detailing how she broke down on the northern tour after missing selection. She claims Moore told her she didn't deserve to be in the team and was only there to play guitar. Did you say those things to her? I don't agree the team and was only there to play guitar. Did you say those things to her? I don't agree with what's been said there around those allegations and in particular I think the completeness of some of them and you know lack total context. What's your relationship like with her now? Oh look I've only spoken to her the ones. And did you clear things up? You obviously have a very different point of view as to what happened. You know, I wouldn't say everything's been necessarily cleared up. What was clear in the review was a lack of high performance practices while there was also a cultural disconnect between management and players. Some of the other words that were used, favouritism, ghosting, body shaming. Are those allegations true? I've never ever thought like that. They're not my words. They're not my values. They're not my beliefs. Moore admits he's read the 30-page review several times. It's been brutal and at times overwhelming for the 62-year-old and his family. It's definitely impacted. You'd be lying if you said that it hasn't. But I think the part that has the biggest toll was seeing it on your family. Moore leaves the Blackfurns as a very successful coach. For most of his tenure, they maintained a 90% winning record, won a fifth World Cup, and became the first women's team to be named World Rugby's Team of the Year. Now, he's ready for a break. What's next for you? I'm not sure, actually. Hopefully a cold beer tonight and maybe a decent sleep. Something that's been in short supply over the last five months. And Ollie Richie joins us now from our Auckland newsroom. Ollie, who's the front runner to replace more now? Yeah, well, I'm told there's definitely interest in former Blackfern's mentor, Alan Bunting. Nothing is set in stone there with Bunting yet, though those conversations are ongoing. But I'm told there is an interest in getting Alan Bunting on board in some capacity. Also interesting to note, Nicky Sir Graham Henry, his role will change a little bit as well. He'll still be one of the key selectors for the Black Ferns, but he'll also perform a coaching mentor role. So he'll oversee a lot of those assistant coaches and their new head coach to help guide them through to the World Cup. There'll also be a cultural and environment coach. Of course, that came out of that review that was released on Monday as a key area to work on. So the next two to three days are proving crucial. That's when they want to get someone on board. Ollie Ritchie, thanks for the update. It's a game that many believe has restored life into super rugby. The Blues have ended an 18-year drought in Christchurch, beating the Crusaders 2723. And both sides agree it may injects a much-needed excitement and spectacle into the sport. Here's Alex Chapman. It's the moment that saw the Blues end an 18-year Christchurch hoodoo. Blues don't need a touch, and at long last. The drought is over. A win nearly two decades in the making, delighting and relieving the visitors. It's a big monkey off the back for sure. The monkey dispatched after the Blues found themselves in an unfamiliar position, playing in front in the Garden City. Genius! Genius from Papua Lee! That helped after a red card to Scott Barrett left the Crusaders at one stage down to just 13 men. The rules, eh? He's got to be better technically and we'll see what happens this week. The captain joining David Harvelli in the Nauty Corner after he was yellow carded. But with their backs against the wall, the hosts weren't going to surrender their record easily. Here it comes, Sarah races in again. Oh, what a game we have on that. And it looked like they may sneak it before. Oh, what defense, what amazing defense from the Blues. Results aside, it's a match both coaches agree will do wonders for the competition, at a time where there's a lack of public interest in our national sport. It was like a test match, two teams with X Factor and skill and physical toughness, and that was great showcase of rugby, I thought. The Blues experienced heads thrilled, though well aware, that titles aren't won in April. We can take a lot of confidence from what we're doing and we'll carry that through the rest of the season but I must stress the importance of it's only round robin and we've got a long way to go. If only every game of footy could be that good. Alex Chapman, Newsub. Kiwi-born Ben Stokes is hot favourite to be appointed the next England cricket captain following the resignation of Joe Root overnight. Root ends his five-year tenure with 27 wins, the most of any England test skipper, but with just one win in the last 17 test matches. Former England captain Nassah Hussain says the timing is right for Root to go, and Vice-Captain is the obvious man to replace him. From what I've seen, they hang on every word Stokes says in that dressing room, and even doesn't have to say anything, they look in Stokes' direction to see Stokes' reaction. He is so well respected in that dressing room. Other contenders include veteran bowler Stuart Broad and Surrey Captain Rory Burns. The Wellington Phoenix are finally back on their home turf. The side trained at Sky Stadium today ahead of their first home game in more than 300 days and it couldn't have come at a more crucial time in the season as they push for a spot in the finals. Gordon Finlayter has more. They're back where they belong. There's a mixture of relief and obviously excitement. Everyone's buzzing for the finals. Gordon Finlater has more. They're back where they belong. There's a mixture of relief and obviously excitement. Everyone's buzzing for the occasion. And it's fair to say it's been a long time coming. There's guys that have never been to New Zealand that are currently here with the squad at the moment that we signed this season. So it's something new to them. It's a privilege for those young boys to get to experience this and the excitement is definitely building. That's because if all goes to plan, they can expect to experience scenes like this. Game over for Wellington, forget all about it. Massive, massive. The game is nothing without the supporters. And there's expected to be more than 15,000 of them in attendance tomorrow. They'll have an important role to play too. With the team arriving home on the back of consecutive wins, the next two matches at home will have. in attendance tomorrow. They'll have an important role to play too. With the team arriving home on the back of consecutive wins, the next two matches at home will have a massive impact for the six-placed Phoenix. It's going to lift us and hopefully it's the push we need to push for that top four. Tomorrow's match against the Mariners won't be easy though. When the two sides met just over a week ago, the Phoenix were pummeled 5-0. Yeah, we owe them one. We owe them a big one. I wanted to make sure the boys got back and they could actually catch up with their families and friends, but at the same time, they know that we're here to do a job. A job, which all going well, could see the Phoenix return home again come finals time. Gordon Findlater, Newsub. And I'd encourage everybody down in Wellington to get along to that thing that's game tomorrow. They're in line for the finals, so it would be great to see a real bumper crowd. And I know, Mitch, if you were down there in your yellow shirt, you'd be getting it off, swinging it around? I don't know if I'm in peak physical condition, Nicky, so I might tell and leave that one on. I'm sure you'd be just fine. Thank you very much, Nikki. Well, if you're looking to watch a film that is already out, then Kate Rogers here to help reviewing an offering that has Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, it'd be just fine. Thank you very much, Nikki. Well, if you're looking to watch a film that is already out, then Kate Rogers here to help, reviewing an offering that has Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, and Brad Pitt, all in the same movie. It's a comedy, and she had very high hopes. Miss Age, I enjoyed your book about The Lost City, and I believe you're the one who could help me find its treasure. What is this? Taken? Am I took it? Now, this is what I call a great trailer. Redder Sage? Getting you out of here. Why are you so handsome? My dad was the weatherman. See what I mean? What a great line and what a great piece of casting. In fact, I can't fault the casting. When it comes to movie stars, these three put the A, an A list. But as for the movie, it's self all I can seem to rustle up at a push is an A for average, a B for B for Bummer, and C for Can the Silly Movie End soon, so I can go home? Alan, what are you doing here? We're here to save you. I'm certified, CPR, I'm certified Crosbitt. I have snacks. Anyway, here's the story. A romance author gets kidnapped by a miniature megalomaniac on a mission to find treasure. Her cover model launches his own mission to rescue her with some help from Brad Pitt. The end. Get it on. I can feel I'm sucking my soul. I feel like a bandit. It feels like there's more holy mother of God. Look, I promise you. I did want to sucking my soul. I feel like a bad dude. It feels like there's more... Holy Mother of God. Look, I promise you. I did want to love this movie. And maybe, maybe I've been lulled into a false sense of security after a steady diet of sensational cinema so far this year. But seriously, people, what am I missing? The Loster City is front-loaded with a few funnies before what's left of the comedy is stretched thinly across the rest of the inanity. If there is any joy to be had, it's knowing how much fun they all seem to be having, making it two stars for effort. Our sneak peek this week is some sensational teasing for Stranger Things fans.

One police officer told NewsHub that rural communities are not getting the service that they deserve as a result of not having enough staff.

Northland under a heavy rain watch from 5pm tomorrow night until 11pm on Monday night is a front from the North Dump's rain. Now, that front also dampens the week ahead for many in the North Island.

Now Indiana Jones season continues with Temple of Doom. Up next on three. Tomorrow's weather might not be perfect for everyone's plans, but it's great for making power. At Moodium, we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Kiyo'a, Etti Fano, another great Easter break day today with plenty of sunshine around and some much-needed rain falling in Southland this morning. Now, this ridge of high pressure should make for a good Easter Sunday but as it moves east this low and its front is going to move into Northland bringing some rain. Some of it will be heavy from Sunday night. While in the south it stays mainly fine and the southerly changes to a northerly so we'll break it down a bit. Any showers north of Christchurch clear tonight with some of those south a bit fresh around Kikorrachurch clear tonight. Some of those south are bit fresh around Kikota. Tomorrow sees some light frost in the south, some drizzle expected around Canterbury, but it does clear for a mainly fine Easter Sunday. Another fine night on the way for the North Bar. A few showers for Auckland North and the Coromandel. Tomorrow there's a few showers. They all float around the Hawks Bay region, but mainly fine until the big blob of blue arrives around dinner time. That's going to bring the rain to Northland. Some of it will be heavy. So let's zoom in now. Showers turn to rain for Kaitaya and Fungare. You are under a heavy rain watch. Thundery falls expected from 5pm. Those southeasterly winds get a bit strong for everyone here as well. So mainly fine day for inland Waikato in the Bay of Plenty. There's a bit of cloud, but nothing that'll stop outdoor plans. Southeasterly is developed with highs here between 17 and 22. And in the east, most of you here get a light shower or two as the wind changes to a southeasterly, but you should see the sun a bit more after breakfast. High's here between 16 and 19. And bring on the Easter egg hunt for the rest of the North Island. The kids might need a jacket as the wind gets a bit chilly, but it's a mainly fine day, New Plymouth and Tomoranoi, getting to 22. Let's hop over the straits. It's a fine day for you with just a bit of cloud and some light winds. Everyone's heading for a high here of around 18, 19 degrees, not too bad. And as we head over the Alps, it's a drizzly start for everyone, but it does clear for a reasonably fine day the southerly changing to a northeasterly your high between 15 and 17. And in the south after a chilly start to the day, Alexandra down to just one tonight, things will find up. The southerly changes to a more warm northeasterly, 14 to 16, the expected highs. Happy Easter to Eden. There'll be some fog in the valleys for the early morning service, but it does fine up with northeasterly's developing, some of them fresh along the coast. A bit chilly for Christchurch with a high of just 14, 15 degrees. Now, you could see some drizzle, but it does get better with Sutherleys turning north-east in the afternoon. Kiyota Wellington, a bit of morning cloud along with your hot cross buns for breakfast, but it does fine up with south-easterly's your high expected between 17 and 19. It's a little more cloudy in Hawke's Bay with a few showers in the ranges as southeasterly develops, cooling things down a bit with a high of 18 to 19 degrees. And another great day on the way for the Tohonga region, partly cloudy conditions, some light winds, then some easterlies. Your high, quite warm around 21, 22 for this time of the year. And it's a nice looking Easter Sunday, plenty of sunshine around for the Hamilton region with a high of 22. Just make the most of it as some rain is on the way Monday. And it's pretty much the same for Auckland, another partly cloudy day with a few showers, maybe some strong winds in the afternoon with your wet weather arriving Monday as well. Okay, in Australia, Cairns, Adelaide and Hobart, get the odd shower. Melbourne should reach a nice warm 27. And in the Pacific Islands, a few showers around for Nuwe, the Cook Islands in Fiji, with thunderstorms expected for Samoa. Okay, back here now. And here's all the wet and windy weather arriving in the north on Monday, not the best for the first week of the school holidays. I'm afraid it's going to stick around all week. And that's a showery week ahead for these areas, but it does start to clear for Hawks Bay from late Tuesday. And for the rest of the North Island, you've got a few showers for Taranaki mid-week and highs of 23 on Wednesday. Now in the South Island, a partly cloudy week with rain arriving for Nelson and Greymouth on Wednesday. And as we head to the southern areas, not a bad first week of the school holidays with a mainly fine week ahead and highs of around 20 degrees. So plenty of chances to wave out to boats and bluff like Cody and Ryan did. And they tell me, Mitch, they even got a wave back from the captain. Captain Orson. Fantastic photo. Thank you very much, Mike. Well, that is News Hub Live at 6 for your Saturday. And you can get in touch with the NewsHub team at news at newshub.com. I'm Mitch McCann from all of us. Good night."}
