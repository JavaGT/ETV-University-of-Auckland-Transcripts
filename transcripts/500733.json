The man shot dead by police near New Plymouth on Saturday night had just used his vehicle to ram the officer's car. Police say they had pulled over a driver who had been travelling in convoy with the victim, Chaos Price, when the 22-year-old drove past and then turned around and aimed his car at them. Last night, Komatoa conducted a catakia with Fargo prison before Price's body was taken from the scene. A post-mortem will be carried out in the coming days. Laten Haeckel reports. This is what's left of the crime scene and it's the closest our cameras could get. A large police presence remains as the scene examination continues at the location police shot and killed 22-year-old Chaos Price. This was a tragic outcome. This is an incredibly difficult and tragic time for Mr Price's Fano who are grieving the loss of their loved one. It all unfolded on State Highway 3 heading from New Plymouth to Waitara at 9.30 on Saturday night. Police say officers pulled over an associate of Price before Price himself drove past turned around and rammed the police car. This afternoon a yellow Mitsubishi and a dog squad police SUV that had clearly been damaged were removed from the cordon. This incident has also been incredibly traumatic for the officers involved. I am extremely grateful that they were not physically harmed during this incident. But just what happened after the police car was rammed remains unclear. The circumstances beyond that are the subject of an ongoing investigation with a number of witness statements still to be taken. The officers involved have yet to provide statements too. Other than describing it as a dynamic situation with a large scene, a number of questions remain about what unfolded, like whether Price was carrying a weapon, how many officers were involved, and why it's taken more than 36 hours to release more information. So again, the scene examination is still being completed today. So until that has occurred, we will not be able to answer those questions. That will also be clarified as part of the ongoing investigation. The investigation is ongoing. We really want to be very thorough and transparent. Chaos Price was well known to police with a long history of offending. He was once described in court as a one-man crime wave. His family didn't want to speak with News Hub today, but did take to Facebook to say he will be missed. The cordon still remains in place tonight with a steady flow of officers in and out. Multiple investigations continue to establish just what happened and where the police were justified in taking the life of chaos price. Late in Haeckel, News Hub. A Russian deadline for the last Romanian-Ukrainian soldiers defending the port city of Maripal to surrender has now expired. Moscow had claimed it would guarantee the lives of any fighters who laid down their arms. But Ukraine's president has insisted their soldiers will fight to the end. Volodymy Zelensky also says around 5,000 children from Maripol had been taken to Russia against their will. Here's ITVs Peter Smith. Russia is closing in on Mario Paul. The last defenders of the city were given an ultimatum. Surrender by this morning or you will not be spared. Those Ukrainians still left have decided to fight on. President Zelensky says the situation in Mario Paul will not get better and he is concerned about Ukrainian children allegedly taken away to Russia. We heard about 5,000 children deported from this region to Russian side, because they didn't allow them to go to the Ukrainian side, I mean, the Ukrainian control side. Yet, that's it, so we don't know what is with their children. Where are they? Nobody knows. The absence of information is because Mario Paul has been cut off by Russia. No electricity, no phone calls, no internet. How are you feeling now? Well, I don't know. But we've spoken to survivors of the siege. Andre tells us what happened when he was caught taking photographs. Russian military police officer came, and that soldier just asked him, okay, what should we do with this civilian? And that guy told him, okay, shoot him. This is actually exact quote, you know. Shoot him. We already shot two civilians today. Just a miracle happened. My statement that I'm a historian saved me. Brothers Alexei and Sasha managed to get their wives and children out, but they don't know if their parents are alive or dead. The bullets are flying overhead. Will you reach the river or not? Will you get water? Will you get back to your home? It's Russian roulette. Vladimir Putin says he's liberating your city of Maripole. What's he liberating you from? Vladimir Putin, he has liberated us from our life, from our jobs, from our memories. If they call this liberation, then yes, we could say he liberated us. The full scale of horrors hidden in Mario Paul is still unknown. For now, it is the testimony of survivors, helping to shed light on life inside Ukraine's darkest city. The Prime Minister has headed off on her first foray into foreign diplomacy in trade in more than two years. It's a six-day tour of Asia. Political reporter Amelia Wade is with her and filed this report from Cairns. For the first time, since our first COVID case, the Prime Minister has officially touched down in foreign soil, though our first stop here in Cairns is to refuel the Defence Force 757. Next, it's onto our fifth and then our fourth biggest training partners, Singapore and then Japan, their collective two-way trade with $14.8 billion last year. Jacinda Ardennes has meetings booked with their counterparts in both countries and top of their agendas will be China and its growing influence in the Pacific as well as the global response to Ukraine. But this trip is as much about diplomacy as it is about promoting New Zealand as a trading partner and top tourist destination. Ardun looking to spread the word far and wide that New Zealand is back and open for business. There are just over 6,000 new cases of COVID-19 in the community today. Cases continue to trend downwards with a seven-day rolling average of just under 8,000 compared to 10,000 a week ago. But hospitalisations are up for the second day in a row to 553 with 23 people in ICU. And another 11 people have died with COVID, taking the total to 597. While New Zealand is tracking well, moddlers say the two-week school holidays could help us even more. Health correspondent Lucy Warhurst explains why. It's the great Easter getaway from the tiniest of travellers to the biggest weekend of travel since the pandemic. Whether returning from the Easter break or jetting off for the school holidays, airports were a buzz, but instead of causing a surge in COVID cases, the holidays could help bring numbers down. Because you've closed schools and you get lots of spread of respiratory disease in schools and those kids bring that home to their families and so we'd expect that to have just stopped. It would actually expect over the next couple of weeks to see slightly lower case numbers maybe. With the borders reopening combined with two long weekends in a row and the school holidays, it is a bumper time for travel. 93,000 people are expected through Auckland Airport alone this Easter weekend. You can't beat Wellington on a sunny day and it's certainly put on an Easter show. Michael Baker says it's great that people are getting out and about, but it's essential they take precautions, like masking up when visiting older relatives. We're still seeing this long tail of people dying from this infection, still are moving average around 14 a day. And that's going to add up, unfortunately, to a lot of deaths in the next month or two. And we can prevent some of those deaths occurring now. While official figures record 800,000 Kiwis having had Omicron, modelists say it could be as many as 2 million or more. We'd expect at the end of this first wave that about half of the population would be infected. And that's a little bit concerning because if we don't know how many infections there have been, then we don't know how to model for reinfections and the waning immunity coming from those infections. So it makes it really hard to do modelling for a second wave and subsequent waves. The next wave is expected in winter. Michael Baker says we need to get vaccinations up to date before that. Only 20% of a bit over 20% of children, fully vaccinated, school-aged children, and a third of adults who are eligible for boosters haven't received them yet. Something to think about, even if winter feels like it's ages away. Lucy Warhurst, News Hub. Tourism operators are gearing up for an influx of international visitors as the phased reopening of the border continues. But will the country be ready to welcome them? Rental car companies are facing a severe shortage of vehicles, while the hospitality industry warns it will take time to get back to business as usual. Caley Callahan reports. Cleaning off the rental cars ready for the return of international tourists. While these cars might be primed and ready to hit the road, there's a severe shortage in the country's fleet. We would traditionally have about 60,000 vehicles for the on season, which is primarily summer and through the summer months. At this point in time, we'd probably be lucky to have 30,000. Rental companies were forced to sell off vehicles when COVID struck, and now getting new wheels in from overseas could be more than a year away. Traditional lead times used to be about three to four months, from the date of order through to delivery. They could be anything from six to 12 months now. Rental car companies aren't the only businesses trying to get up to speed. In the first 12 months since the pandemic started, more than 300 businesses in the Queenstown Lakes District closed. That's prompted a warning from the tourist hotspot. Things will be a little quieter in the beginning. There are some businesses that have struggled to stay open during that period. There are some businesses that have had to hibernate, but they're coming back on stream. Like much of the tourism sector, restaurants and bars are struggling with staff shortages. Let's be honest, some of the service may not be top-notch, so let's ask for some forgiveness and understanding and patience. Ahead of the tens of thousands of international tourists due to arrive in the coming months. But without the cars to get those cashed-up travellers around the MOTU, the industry is worried they might choose not to come. If tourists don't think they're going to have that availability, they may go to other countries, which is a concern to us as a country rebounding. The race is on to get the country's fleet numbers up before the visitors touched down. Kaylee Callahan NewsHub. Ongoing mobility issues have forced the Queen to miss the traditional Royal Easter Sunday service at St George's Chapel. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Cade, attended with their children along with other members of the royal family. Ninety-six-year-old Queen Elizabeth also missed the annual Royal Monde service on Thursday, one of her most cherished events. A man charged with murdering a 64-year-old woman in her home has appeared at the Christchurch District Court. It's been reported Valheney was isolating at home with COVID-19 when she was killed. Kasha Brownlee was in court. Two weeks after 64-year-old Val Heaney was found dead in her Walcott Street home in Bromley, a 42-year-old man has appeared in Christchurch district court charged with her murder. The man appeared by VideoLink. He was granted interim name suppression and remanded in custody without plea until a second appearance next month in the High Court. Police initially treated Heaney's death as unexplained, but upgraded it to a homicide investigation following the autopsy. The charge sheets alleged Hini was killed on April 3rd. She was found dead the following day. Police said the man was known to Hini. Hini's family weren't in court today, but following her death, they released a statement saying they were grieving the loss of a much-loved family member. They said Val Hini's family weren't in court today, but following her death, they released a statement saying they were grieving the loss of a much-loved family member. They said Valhene was a carer who worked with people with intellectual disabilities and a community support worker, which was a testament to the kind, wonderful person she was. Police thanked the community for their support and cooperation throughout the investigation. Kasha Brownlee, NewsHub. Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery to do with extracting ancient DNA from small fossils and artifacts. As Suzette Howe explains, the breakthrough opens up a world of possibilities for museums and researchers to access the history of our smaller species in New Zealand and across the globe. This tiny ancient gecko bone might not be much bigger than your fingernail, but it contains centuries of precious data. There's lots and lots of morphological characters on these bones. But accessing that ancient DNA without destroying the sample in the process has long been a problem for researchers and museum curators. Traditionally, if you wanted to sample a bone for ancient DNA research, we would chop a chunk out or drill a hole. Now, a big bone can handle that. Small bones, like geckos or small bird bones, they can't. If you tried that, you'd destroy the whole bone, and you'd have a very angry museum curator on your hands. But University of Otago researchers discovered a new technique during a recent study into New Zealand's past gecko populations. We put our small bone in enzymatic bone bath and it soaks out the DNA and we can do CT scanning before and after this soaking out and you can't see any difference to the bone. It's completely non-destructive. It's welcome news to museum curators across the globe who've been torn between preserving the history of fragile samples and understanding the past. It opens up whole swathes of material which has been in museum collections, which curators have typically been very hesitant to allow geneticists to access for sampling. Oh no, it's very exciting. So we can now start reconstructing evolutionary history of not just geckos that we focused on, but also skinks, frogs, tuotara that we're working on in our lab. Providing an opportunity for these tiny taunga species to tell us more about their past. Susette Haar News Hub.

Doctors in Sri Lanka say lives will be lost as the country's supply of medical equipment rapidly declines. They say they have run out of life-saving drugs and are having to reuse gloves and surgical blades several times. Kethaki Maslamini reports. Doctors adding their voices to the nationwide call. Go home! Go home! For the country's president to step down after years of mismanaging the economy. For those in the medical field, it's not just a personal plea. It's a professional one. If there's no drugs or no vital drugs, the people will lose their life. Dr. Vasan Rappna Singhham is coordinating international aid and says the country is short more than 240 drugs as well as medical equipment. He says Sri Lankan hospitals have continued treating patients through 30 years of a civil war after a tsunami and even coped through waves of COVID. But the lack of funds has seen routine surgeries grind to a halt and doctors take to the streets. And for the procedures that can go ahead, doctors say they have to re-steroise and reuse surgical equipment, including blades. It makes the blade a bit dull, so the operation isn't as need. Recently, they have a shortage of a drug called neostigmin. It's used to wake up the patient after the anesthesia. If someone comes to the heart back, Godless. Dr. Sachita Vijay Ratna says drugs used to get rid of blood clots are among those the hospitals need. They're having to ask patients to source them elsewhere. The patient has to bring that drug from the outside pharmacy by paying himself. Most of it's sometimes very unaffordable for patients because these are fairly expensive. The doctors are appealing to the international medical community for help with their list of needs. Dr. Vassan says there are just weeks' worth of stocklift of life-saving drugs. The health sector will go into a language stage where, you know, it will collapse very soon. And he says they won't be able to avoid preventable deaths. Kepki Masalamini NewsHab.

Police are investigating after a brazen attack on security guards at a Hamilton Kmart. Video posted to social media shows two women attacking the security guards, one using a set of tongs as a weapon, the other pulling the hair of a female guard. The man in red shorts and wearing a red cap can be seen attempting to help staff restrain the two offenders. The women then appeared to have taken off with stolen items. Police have taken witness statements but no arrests have been made. In a time where food prices are at record highs people are looking at alternative cheaper ways to grow and source food and foraging is rising in popularity. In Christchurch it started flourishing with all the land left uninhabitable after the earthquakes and now there's a growing community of foragers. Here's Juliet Speedy. Picking. Plucking. Tasting. Ototahi Christchurch is the perfect place for foraging. Walnuts, hairs, edible weeds, chickweed, miners, lettuce, dandeline leaves. Mushroom, grapes, kiwi fruit, blackberries. The city's devastating earthquakes saw around 8,000 homes demolished or removed. But broken dreams have blossomed into large chunks of fertile land, rich in produce. Community gardens have developed. Foraging groups have formed. There's things like edible streets and there's urban farms happening and there's community gardens. Lots of people and a diversity of people using the area for food sharing and to build that food resilience. And oh how we need that. Latest figures show food prices up 7.6%. The highest increase in 10 years. Fruit and vegetables are the worst, with prices up 18%. Foraging is good for the soul and the pocket. Inga is vegetarian, and there are many weeks where she spends $0 on food. No fruit and veggies that I buy anymore. No herbs or nuts either. She either grows it or finds it. Joanna says she would save around $60 a week. I find that I don't really need to get a lot from the supermarket in terms of fruit and produce. Inge is now a foraging expert, taking workshops teaching her skills. It's when you see the seats, it's the highest nutritional value. I always wanted to be the person who passes on something valuable to the people. Forrest food is also spray-free and better for you, while also far better for the climate, as a local product with zero transportation, processing or plastic. As we go through a crisis with climate change as well, that we start, you know, really looking at where our food comes from. These days, many groups gather to forage learning new skills, especially in identifying as well that we start, you know, really looking at where our food comes from. These days many groups gather to forage learning new skills, especially in identifying what's edible, distinguishing tasty mushrooms from poisonous ones, finding the edible flowers and weeds. The term low-hanging fruit doesn't have a great reputation, but when it comes to foraging, that's exactly what you need. Unless you have a prop to get the bigger ones at the top. Grace and her mum got a good bounty today. Apples and walnuts and rosemary, sage. It's good for their mental health as well to get outside and have fun. In fact, it seems there's nothing negative about this hobby. I'm getting brilliant food and I'm not dependent on anyone. I think people need this as well. It's really good for their well-being in so many ways. Bountiful baskets for a better life. Juliet Speedy News Hub. After over a month of being stuck fast in a US estuary, the cargo ship Ever Ford has been refloated. The huge ship ran aground 7 metres into the mud on March 13. Emergency crews had to dig over 64,000 cubic metres of mud from around the vessel to free it. Last year, another ship from the same company, the Ever Given, got stuck and blocked the sewers canal for a week costing $100 billion in trade. Well, Maritime New Zealand has seen a huge increase in the number of personal locator beacons being set off accidentally. One rescue centre says they are called out to a false alarm every single day. It's an expensive exercise, so authorities are urging beacon owners to register their details so they can be contacted. Here's Alexa Cook. Logan Hughes was driving a tractor on his Alfredin farm in the Taradua district last month. When the locator beacon on his belt activated, without him realising. It had just rubbed up against the side of the seat and just pressed the button slightly. Arriving home for lunch an hour or so later, he found a rescue helicopter landing by the house. Buzzed round above the house for a bit, then just landed down on that plateau there. He'd just bought the beacon but hadn't finished registering his contact details online. So when it was triggered, they had no way of checking with him to see if it was a genuine emergency. I felt so sorry for myself. It wasn't a very good situation. He's one of hundreds of Kiwis a year that accidentally let off their locator beacons. Maritime NZ has seen a surge in Kiwis using PLBs or personal locator beacons as they become more accessible. There were 120,000 registered owners in 2019. Now there are 140,000. The PLBs are increasing in popularity because they're just so easy for people to take out on their activities. And that's increased the amount of false beacon alerts. There used to be a couple a week, but now... It's about a third of our operations inadvertent, and that kind of works out to be about one per day that we're dealing with, the inadvertent or accidental. If the beacon is not registered, then the owner can't be reached, and a rescue operation is launched, which can waste precious time and resources. Crews do get sent to ininvertent activations and that potentially could take the crews away from somewhere where they are needed. False alarms like this one in Hawks Bay where an expired locator beacon had switched on when it was dumped in a bin. Anytime we get a beacon activation, aninverting door reel, it's all hands on deck. If you own a locator beacon, you must register it online at beacons.org.nz. Otherwise, you run the risk of one of these landing at your place because the rescue centre can't contact you. Something Logan's learnt the hard way, but he's glad help would be there in an emergency. If I'm at the bottom of the hill, with my life in danger and I need saving, they're going to come and get me. And when you're handling or storing a beacon, read the instructions first. It can either be the button being pressed while testing or it can be because it's been crushed in a pack because you're storing it incorrectly. To make sure rescue crews are only called out for the real deal. Alexa Cook News Hub. Driving at speeds of over 340 kilometres now would be too much for many, but try doing it when you're blind.

The Warriors will seek formal clarification on a number of incidents they aren't happy with, following last night's defeat to the roosters. It's understood the club will ask for a please explain from the NRL's referees boss. But while they want answers, coach Nathan Brown's looking at their own costly mistakes from the 2214 loss. James Regan has more. This was one of many questionable calls. You'd hard to argue with the captain here. Little hand in there from bright. That's a penalty. I'll win this challenge. Adam Fenua Blake's challenge wasn't successful, despite Angus Christen appearing to knock the ball out of his hands. The Warriors will be seeking formal clarification from referee boss Graham Annesley on this and a number of other calls, including Jesse Arthur's disallowed try. They're saying, Reese Walsh knocked it on. Gee, I thought the ball was stripped there by... Clitch of Baker. The decisions were at crucial times in the match. Arthur's no try came at eight all. While Fanoa Blake's unsuccessful challenge was off the back of a try to bring them back in the game, thanks to some magic from Reese Walsh. How's that for a kick? Remarkable for Watanis, the winner fell over. So James Tedesco, avoiding the sin bin and the first half will also be looked at, would the club understood to be unhappy with a culmination of things? Despite the warrior's frustration at the officials, coach Nathan Brown also admits they had plenty of missed opportunities. Certainly the referee's not why we're sitting there on the losing side. We've got some things we need to worry about ourselves. We just didn't play enough football, you know, so they certainly won the yardage game, and we spent a lot of time on our trial line. After holding a lead at the break, things unravelled at the start of the second half as the roosters gained momentum. You know, to come out and I guess just leave our words in the sheds, you know, it's what we spoke about there on the field. It's probably the most disappointing thing, you know. We're saying the right things, but when you don't come out and back it up, what's the point? The Warriors left looking at themselves and the officials after a game to forget. James Regan, News Hub. Kiwi cyclist Patrick Bevan has secured the biggest win of his career after claiming the overall title at the tour of Turkey. The Israel Startup Nation rider took the lead in the standings after winning the penultimate stage, a position he held onto after the final stage was cancelled after just 25Ks of racing. Didn't think it would be neutralised quite like that, but at the end of the day it was pretty much unrideable and as soon as there was any water on the road, I think it's been so dry for so long and the city roads are oily and slippery and it was just chaos. It's Bevan's first general classification victory. Well, after finishing runners up in Singapore, the All Black Sevens team have had a disappointing tournament in Vancouver. New Zealand raced out to an early lead in their quarter final clash against Australia and they were flying at half time, up 12-0, but fell apart in the second half, suffering a 1912 defeat. Henry Hutchison pushes it wide, Morris Longbottom, put it back to Hutchison. I think it'd open up for them. They've got space too loud wide, Corey Tool in the corner. For the first time in 11 attempts, Australia has beaten New Zealand. Zealand finished sixth overall, while Argentina upsets the Olympic champions Fiji, 2910 in the final, to claim an emotional first World Series win in 14 years. Great stuff. Braden Curry will finally head overseas tomorrow to compete in a race he spent almost three years preparing for. The COVID pandemic meant the Iron Man World Championship hasn't taken place since 2019, but it's going ahead next month. And Curry wants to become the first Kiwi Mal ever to win the famous event. Gordon Finlater caught up with him. Braden Curry has spent plenty of time training for his biggest event. But due to COVID postponements, it's been much longer than anticipated. It's a good nearly three years of building towards, yeah, world champs. The cancellation of the 2020 Iron Man World Champs and postponement to the 2021 event, keeping him stuck at home in Monika. But that's finally set to change. Yeah, it's hard when your career kind of gets put on hold in a lot of ways. So, yeah, it's exciting to think that hopefully this year will be the year that things fire back up again. And in just a few weeks they will, when Curry gets his crack at the pinnacle event in Utah, moved away from its traditional home in Hawaii. It won't be as hot, but altitude will be a challenge. Definitely will make the lungs tickle when you're getting up towards the top. And although he hasn't been able to compete overseas, the pandemic did come with one positive. See, later. Returning to the event where it all started earlier this year, winning the Coast to Coast. The Coast to Coast champion. Returning to the coast to coast was really special. It's been a long time. And it was obviously the race that got me into endurance sport. The dream now to better his seventh place finish at World Champs in 2019 and go one step further than Cameron Brown in 2005 when he finished second. For me it's sort of been a dream I've been working towards for I guess the last five, six years now. If he can be the first Kiwi man to conquer it, it will certainly be worth the weight. Gordon Findlater, Newsup. Finally tonight, not only have Chelsea given themselves a chance to get revenge over Liverpool in the FA Cup final after losing a tense Carabelle Cup showdown on penalties, but their 2-0 semi-final win over Crystal Palace has given the Blues an opportunity to win their first piece of silverware since the club was put up for sale. ITV's Chris Scudder has the action. If it was down to Cup heritage, no contest. The footballing royalty from the King's Road had won it eight times. The pretenders to the throne from the palace, not once in a century and a half of trying how their fans dreamt of a first cup coronation. At the helm, figurehead coach Patrick Vieira five times a cup winner as a player. Gone was Chelsea's blue for yellow and Havert's blatant dive brought him a matching card. Chances were few and far between when they came, Palace crucially missed theirs. It's a great chance. And you sensed what might be coming. Chelsea were not so wasteful. Squares it might come back to Ruben Lofton's cheek. Chelsea lead. It's a first goal for Ruben Loftus cheek in three years. 1-0 soon became two. He got the touch. Mount for the first time in his career, he scores in three successive games. And for Palace, what might have been. Anderson's made a massive miss. What a chance to get back into the game. It could have been three for Chelsea, but no matter after a disrupted season off the field. On it, they're heading for a third cup final in a row where Liverpool will be waiting next month. Yes, they will, Mitch. But let me tell you, there is no chance of Chelsea upsetting Liverpool's hopes of doing the quadruple, if I may say so. Well, I know you are a Liverpool fan, Norel, so there might be some bias there. I don't know about that. Norel, thank you very much. Well, for most visually impaired people, the opportunity to drive a car, let alone break a world's speed record, is the stuff of fantasy. But as Steve Harpon from CBS found out, such things are possible. And similar stories of dedication and perseverance can come pretty close to home. You're welcome to listen in. But I chose this week's story mainly for an audience of one. This 12-year-old named Ted. Yes. Ted is my nephew. Very hard. And he says sometimes his blindness feels insurmountable. I see. I thought like I was doomed. That does sound a little immature, but. What was me kind of feeling? Yes. I really want to be like everybody else sometimes, you know. And that's why when I heard about this drag racer attempting to set a new world speed record, I thought Ted and others like him had to meet the driver. In 2012, Dan Parker of Columbus, Georgia, got in a crash. He suffered a traumatic brain injury so severe it blinded him. I never imagined I'd be back in the seat of the race car. But I've been a racer in my whole life. I just had to figure out another way to do it. A machinist by trade, Dan got adaptive equipment so he could make parts. Two point nine. And then designed this entire race car. Everything in this car? Yeah, pretty much, yeah. That just amazes me. What does he look like? Mustache and a beard? I have a mustache. You have a mustache? See? Whiskers? I hope nobody sees them. Oh, don't worry about it. That won't be an issue. Anyway, back to our story. Last week, Dan and his crew came here to Spaceport America in southern New Mexico to attempt a Guinness record. Fastest car-driven, blindfolded. Of course, no blindfold was needed. But he did have a special audio guidance system, and for safety purposes, a sighted driver next to him, hands hovering over the steering wheel just in case. It wasn't necessary. Dan went 211 miles an hour, set a record, and more importantly, an example. Ted, I want you know that blindness is not what is stopping you. Surround yourself with believers and go for your dreams. You can make the excuses or make it happen. Dan says inspiring the Ted's of the world is the main reason he did this. And if my nephew is any indication, it was well worth the drive. If you can do that, well then I think I could easily pursue my dream. What about flying plane? That's exactly what I wanted to come from this. Well, many international events have returned since the pandemic eased and that includes International Pillow Fight Day. New Yorkers took the chance to heave pillows at each other to mark the occasion. According to the rules, participants must swing their pillows lightly and use soft pillows only. Some cities even ban feather pillows but others encourage them. The first International Pillow fight day was held in 2008. Our top stories tonight. The man shot dead by police near New Plymouth yesterday had just used his vehicle to ram a police car. A Russian deadline for the last Romanian-Ukrainian soldiers defending the port city of Maripal to surrender has expired, but Ukraine's president has insisted their soldiers will fight to the end. And the Prime Minister has taken off on her first international trip since the start of the pandemic, a six-day tour of Asia. Well, coming up, NewsHub weather and more warnings and watches issued in the past few hours, Mike. Yes, Mitch, the orange warning remains for Northland until 3 a.m. with a warning out of the Coromandel Peninsula through to 3pm tomorrow.

Turn it to power by Meridian. Kiora, good evening. Rain in the north, sun in the south. It was a day of two halves weather-wise, and tomorrow sees another wet day for the upper half of the North Island, as these fronts bring thundery downfalls. Meanwhile, this big high over here leaves a ridge over the lower North Island and much of the South Island, meaning a fine Tuesday for you. Heavy rain will arrive in Fiordland on Wednesday. Okay, a mainly fine night for the South Island tonight with a bit of cloud and some showers in Fjordland. Okay, a mainly fine night for the South Island tonight with a bit of cloud and some showers in Fjordland. Tomorrow, a mainly fine day for everyone, apart from some areas of morning and evening. Cloud, Fjordland and Westport areas, you'll see the odd shower with a heavy rain watch in place on Wednesday. In the North Island, it's not too bad for the lower half with a fine night. Periods of rain remain for the upper half with heavy falls expected for Northland and Northern Auckland and also Coromandel. Tomorrow it's fine in the south with thundery downfalls spreading to the Bay of Plenty. Let's take a closer look now. Occasional showers and thunderstorms for places Auckland North with downpours expected in the morning. Fittiyanga gets periods of rain, heavy rain warnings and watches have been issued for those areas. Further south in Taupil and Tokoroa have a mostly cloudy day with light rain at times but that rain a bit more occasional for Rotor and Fakitane. Now heavy rain watch in place for the Tohanga region. A drizzly start for the Gisbon and Hawks Bay areas with light rain during the day Danny Verk gets in Clowell while Masterson should say nice and fine on 22. And what a way to start the short week for those in Manawatu, Kapiti Coast and Wellington, a sun-filled day with light winds, New Plymouth and Tomorunu, you get a few spots of rain in the morning. Let's get on the ferry, put the sunglasses on because the sun is out for everyone here after some early morning fog. A bit more cloud develops for Nelson, highs here in the early 20s. And in the east, Blenheim gets to 24 with everyone else. Around 20 degrees with a fine day, could be a bit of fog around for Christchurch in the morning. And another day off with Southland Anniversary Day tomorrow. Well planned. Now, there's a few northerlies and maybe a shower or two for Stuart Island, but mainly fine here with highs between 17 and 20. Looking at the metros now, a fine Monday for the Dunedin region with high cloud, the northerlies will pick up along the coast in the afternoon. Upstate Highway 1 to Christchurch now. Pretty good Tuesday on the cards for you with just a bit of morning and evening. Cloud highs here between 18 and 20. Hello, Wellington. Again, the place to be with a fine day for you. The sun is out all day with light winds. Expect a high between 21 and 23. A little more damp for Hawks Bay with some patchy rain or drizzle and some northerly winds. Hastings and Napier, both reaching a respectable 21 degrees. And as we head further north, the track up the mount's going to be quiet tomorrow with periods of rain expected, along with thunderstorms and some heavy falls, heavy rain watch in place for you. Inland now to the Waikato region and it's a mostly cloudy day with a few light showers. Twenty-two, you're expected high for Tuesday and take the brolly if you're walking to work in Tamaki Makoto, scattered showers with the odd heavy fall and thunderstorms expected especially north of the city. Overseas now and Sydney and Adelaide get showers with rain for Melbourne, but it should be mainly fine for everyone else and in the Pacific Islands. It's a mixture of showers and sunshine for everyone, the Cook Islands, seeing the most sunshine with the high of 27. Okay, back here now, and let's take a look at week one of the school holidays. I guess it's the indoor plan for you with wet weather most of the week. And unfortunately, here we have it again, a wet week ahead for these areas. But for those needing rain, I guess we notch it up as a good week. And for the rest of the North Island, Wednesday is looking okay for Palmerston North and Hwanganoi, but showers will dominate. Under the South Island hour, after a good start, the wet weather arrives for you from Wednesday. And wait for it. A few more peaks of sun in the south, especially for Christchurch and Dunedon on Wednesday, with sadly showers predicted for the rest of the week. So a wet week ahead with potential thunderstorms in the north tonight, so be careful if you're on the roads. A far cry from the beautiful view on the heafy track this morning, Mitch. Looks just like summer. Thank you very much, Mike. Well, that is News Hub Live at 6 for your Easter Monday. You can get in touch with the NewsHub team at news at news.combe.com.
