It is pretty, pretty blim and cool. All right, it's just going six o'clock, so here is Chris Chang with your news. Thanks, Jenny May, Kyoto. A deadline for Ukrainian forces in the besieged city of Maripole to surrender has passed, despite being vastly outnumbered by Russian forces. While an agreement for a humanitarian corridor has meant some civilians have managed to flee, more than 100,000 still remain trapped in the city. The BBC's Mark Lowen has the latest. Marjupol once a thriving port city besieged and broken. The last bastion of Ukraine's resistance is the Azov-style steel plant, perhaps a few thousand soldiers and civilians in its bunkers and tunnels, a patch of land holding out against one of the world's biggest armies. And now a rare voice from inside the nightmare. This is our appeal to the world, says Marine Sadhi Volina. It could be the last of our lives. We are probably facing our final days, if not ours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. But today again, they refused Russia's latest surrender deadline. Ukraine's president said he's offered Moscow an exchange of Russian prisoners of war for safe passage out of Marupol. Across the country in Kiev it's all quiet on the western front. So from a volunteer center they send supplies to the east, first aid, food and preparations for battle to those repelling the Russian assault. Among the staff is Ollena Nikolina, whose cousin Max is one of the last fighters in the steel plant. There's a pride of Russian army here. They've gathered spoils of war from an invasion that's not gone Moscow's way. Or back here New Zealanders could see inflation at its highest rate in more than 30 years. The latest consumer price index figures will be released later this morning with predictions inflation could hit 7% higher than it's been here for more than three decades. And we'll take a closer look at inflation later in the show to explain what it's going to mean for you. Prime Minister Justinder Ardern has touched down in Tokyo the next leg of her first overseas trip since 2020. The Prime Minister will be in the Japanese capital for two days to discuss business, tourism and trade. Of course, the New Zealand delegation travelling with Ms Arden have completed compulsory saliva testing on arrival in Japan and are not allowed to leave their hotel rooms until the results come back negative. Three delegates were unable to fly to Japan after COVID was detected in tests taken in Singapore. in Singapore. Scott Morrison and opposition leader Anthony Albanese have gone head to head in the first leaders debate of the Australian Federal Election Campaign. One news Australia correspondent Andrew McFarlane wraps up the action. Well the first election debate of the season has finally wrapped up. It was on Sky News last night and in front of 100 potential voters and really it was a bit of a fizzer. It was mainly focused on those policy points and less around the two personalities of the politicians. A wide range of topics were discussed. China's influence in the Pacific, the aged care crisis and also COVID-19 going forward. However, if voters were looking for a clear winner they probably didn't find one. Both are politicians had a pretty good sweet of answers up their sleeves. A few zingers, one or two here and there, but really it was all about their policy points as they go forward for May 21st polling day. The polls are showing and is going to be a tight one, so there are a few more debates yet for voters to have their say and see who they want to cast their ballot for. To sport and Russian and Belarusian tennis players have been banned from competing at Wimbledon. The All England Clubs Committee says it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian and Belarusian players. It means world number two Daniel Medvedev and women's world number four Anya Subalanka plus former world number one Victoria as a rancor will miss the tournament. Officials also said if circumstances change materially between now and June they would reconsider their decision. The Northern Stars have given their fans something to cheer about in their first home game of the season. The Auckland-based sides clash with the tactics was just their fourth game of the competition after COVID disrupted their opening games. The stars were pushed by the tactics right up until the final quarter that pulled away for a 56-48 win. Really stoked to finally be back at home. It feels like forever since we last played here, so really happy with that. And considering that was a way better game from both sides than last Saturday when we played them so in fact that's came out to us and I'm really glad we set our ground. The stars sit forth on the latter, bear in mind they've got those two games in hand. Right let's have a look at how your weathers shaping up around the country today starting with some warnings for heavy rain in northern and northern and western parts of the South Island and a watch is in place for Taranaki where heavy rain is expected to hit later this evening.

Not quite so nice a picture through here. A bit of gray for all of you. Showers and Tomadonui, Levin and Wellington and heavy rains coming your way later, Tananaki. Across the Cook Strait, thunderstorms could be on the way for Nelson through the West Coast. Rain also possible in Blenheim and Kekkold are later today. 23 degrees the high there. And rain to book in the day for most of you through White Tahoe and Tabri. Christish though the morning showers should clear for a partly cloudy day. You're going to get to a high of 26. And rain for all through here. That will be heavy all day in Milford Sound Sound sound should clear for a time this morning for the rest of you. 21 degrees the high for Dunedin. Nice.

One with a attorney or a lawyer out of the US who is looking to sue social media giants. Because in his opinion, it's not only actually his opinion, it is the people who he has dealt with and the impacts of social media on their families and in particular, and as right we all know about social media and how much time that it takes up with our kids but do we actually know the real dangers around social media? well his clients do and they've had enough so we're hoping to speak to Matthew Bergman who is a lawyer out of Seattle in the US so I happen to get to him in the next couple of minutes but in the meantime this morning because I was just feeling a little bit tired, I decided I'd do some cartwheels. As you do when you're tired. As you do, just trying to get the blood flowing, you know, energy going. And anyway, it was quite interesting because everybody was going, man man I can't do one. Which I was quite stunned about. So impressed though and not just that Jay May I think you came around to my desk and did that handstand thing where you walk doing the handstand and lasted a pretty long I'm sure it was like three to four meters which I couldn't even do that when I was 10. Yes that was amazing. When I get out of there just to wake up.. I just like back about about a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit to the about about about about about a bit. Like a gentleman, like, feel a bit more awake. Yeah, actually, but you know, the thing, I don't actually think it worked to be fair. No, you've just, you know, it's really bad migrain. Something like that. Anyway, it got us thinking about the things that you used to be able to do as a kid that you wish you could do now. We're talking about things like, like, like, like bars? I can't do that I could never do the monkey bars Really? Honestly, I think like honestly being tongued I'm like bottom heavy and I just didn't have the upper body strengths to carry myself To ever do that. Yeah, fold holding your legs You know, we're sitting cross the edge. Yeah, yeah, and you notice when you have kids, hey because you get down on the get down on the floor.. say because you get down on the get down on the floor and go to things like gymnastics and you go oh you have to sit down and then after a while can't do it you sitting cross that you could stand up all of a sudden the knees have gone angles have gone you know what it takes you half an hour to actually stand up in the first instance right so anyway we'd love to hear from you we must have other talents then that we can draw on what would would you all speak Chris that you think that you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you could do you you wish you could do that you could you can't do anymore. things I used to be able to do. I tell you what I used well I played the piano and obviously being a good Chinese boy, you played piano, used to play a lot, made to practice every day, that sort of thing. It's kind of one of those things if you don't use it, you lose it a little bit. Yeah, even if I try and play now my fingers don't have the same sort of dexterity need to warm up the wall. Sure, yeah. I reckon it wouldn't take long for it to come back to you. No, it's not too bad, but I mean if I looked at what I probably could do when I was a youngster, a young buck. Actually, that's a good one, because we're talking about things that you used to be able to. Languages as well, languages, you don't use it, you lose it. But there's something like that also, that you wish that you still had, that you put a lot of time and a lot of effort into it, but because you haven't actually been using it over these last few years, you know, that you haven't been able to do that anytime. anyway, breakfast at breakfast at, breakfast at TVNZ.co.oz.

No my hooky mind or welcome back to breakfast. It's 20 past six. Social media is a powerful tool, one that can be used for goods connecting users to the world and us here on breakfast to you at home. But as we know, it's also a slippery slope. Think of the misinformation, the addictive hits of dopamine, the need for constant connection, and of course, cyber bullying. for unsuspecting parents and vulnerable teens. It's a minefield to navigate. So much so one US lawyer is hoping to sue the social media giants who he says often choose profits over people. That lawyer Matthew P. Bergman from the Social Media Victims Law Center joins us now from Seattle. Thank you so much for being with us this morning Matthew. And you know here's the thing, I don't think there's any parent watching this morning's interview who will have any doubt about the impacts of social media. But I'm guessing for most of us that we actually don't fully realize all the dangers, the full extent of the danger. Can we start at this point? As an attorney, what consequences have you witnessed with your clients over the years? Well what we see first and foremost is that the social media platforms rely on a profit model geared toward maximizing their screen time. And so they devised algorithms that are singularly designed to keep kids online no matter what. And as a consequence, they are, as you've indicated through the dopamine response, exposed to more extreme material that cause severe mental illness to them. We've seen a number of cases involving children who take their lives as a result of social media addiction. Many cases of attempted suicide, eating disorders, cyber bullying. In many instances where young people, primarily girls, cyber bullying, in many instances where young people, primarily girls but not only girls, are kind of grouped by people posing as children who are actually adults to send inappropriate photographs of themselves. Matthew is this is an increasing problem that you have seen over the years? Well yes the research bears that out. In the United States, for example, there's been a hundred and forty-six percent increase in suicide in the 12- to 16-year-old category. Since not 2008, what changed the lives of teenagers? Well, it was the advent of social media in 2008 going forward. And we've seen other research involving other very significant mental health challenges like eating disorders, hospital admissions, attempted suicide, and the like. The US Surgeon General issued a report just in January talking about a crisis among teams in mental health. And from what we understand and from what I've looked at to, this is not a US-only phenomena. We're seeing this around the world. Yeah, and here in Altaero and New Zealand as well. So talk to me about social media companies and how much responsibility they are actually taking. And I'm guessing not, bugger-or-all, not much, given the fact that you are looking to sue some of these social media companies. Well they say some nice things and they've made some very small changes but fold them fundamentally they've not changed their algorithms or their profit model. And they won't as long as they're forced to do so. Look, I mean our idea of product liability is that until it's cheaper for companies to make safe products and make dangerous products, they're going to keep making dangerous products. And the fact that we have an entire generation of young people throughout the world who are having severe mental health challenges doesn't seem to sway them. We can talk about social media platforms or social media companies and the harm that they can create, the spaces that they create, but also what about the responsibility on users? What about the responsibility on parents of teenagers who are using social media? What responsibility do they have to tell? The parents have responsibility. And the problem is that these platforms are expressly designed to thwart parental responsibility. For instance, Snapchat, one reason why it's popular among teenagers, is because the messages disappear. It's very hard for parents to control their kids' social media use. If they don't know what they're doing. And look, kids will be kids. They open multiple accounts under different names. And it's very hard for parents to know exactly what their kids are doing. The only thing would be taking away their phones. But in this day and age, kids use their phones for so much stuff, including good stuff, like getting their homework assignments or doing research. So parents really are being thwarted and flummets. Look, it's always the parents' responsibility to take care of their kids, but they should get some help. You know, when I was growing up and I was hanging out with the wrong type, my parents would ground me and put me at home. And, you know, I can't imagine I was much fun to be around, but my parents would at least within the four corners of our of insurance today. I was much fun to be around, but my parents told that at least within the four corners of our home, I was safe. Parents don't have those kinds of assurances today. Yeah, yeah. Matthew, we do have to wrap things up, but I do want to finish with asking, you are the founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center. What drove you to create a space for people who feel that they are victims of social media? Well, I spent 30 years as a lawyer recovering compensation for victims, and I've had a lot of success doing that. But I wanted to develop the next part of my career to not just compensating victims, but trying to prevent them from having additional victims come to light. And I believe that what's, what's the changes that could be made to make these profit these these products safer are very doable, very easily implemented, and I believe that we can we can save our kids. And I think parents of all political stripes and all nationalities, of all cultures, religions, need to stand up and say enough is enough, and I want to help leave the charge. Matthew, you're a good man. Thank you so and on behalf of parents go well with the work that you are doing Matthew P. Birdman social media victims law centre thank you so much really appreciate your time. Thank you very much. huge topic for a lot of parents actually but changing tack here 26 past 6 is in a boat is it a plane? Well it's sort of both. Look check this out. This is a sea glider and they are coming to Althero. This new way of travel is high-speed electric so we'll cut our carbon footprint and also affordable, achieving aircraft speeds at a fraction of the cost. A newly established New Zealand-based transport business ocean flyers hoping to revolutionise travel travel here in Althe aircraft speeds at a fraction of the cost. A newly established New Zealand-based transport business ocean flyers hoping to revolutionise travel here in Aal Theor following a $700 million agreement with US aerospace company Regent. The multi-million dollar deal includes 25 passenger sea gliders and we can expect the first delivery in 2025. So here to tell us more about this is Regent CEO Billy Dalhaimens and do we have a sorry I was just wondering who we have with you is it? Oh Billy and Shah are you with us as well from Ocean Flyer? Yes. Yes. the sea air. And Billy thank you so much both for joining us this morning so I think I'll start with you. Tell me how did the sea gliders work? Well look they're using plants have known as winging ground effects so they start on their home as they gain speed they lift onto their foils and once they have full throttle they're flying 10 meters above the surface of the water. It's pretty cool stuff. Oh yeah, it's amazing. just tell me how fast they fly? Yes, sir. Look, can you hear me now? Oh, there you go. Oh, yeah. Oh, miles an hour, 50 kilometers an hour in the harbor. That's incredible. And it's behind you, right? This is a prototype. Because I do believe like the first ever sea glider prototype in the flesh. This is a quarter scale prototype.. It's about five and a half meter wing span. We're undergoing testing of this vehicle now, really working through the operations and the safety on route to, as you said, entry to service by 2025. So will these have flight attendants? How many passengers can you fit on board, Billy? I will. The shot and Flyer will be operating these. So our first vehicle is 12 passengers. Why don't you talk a bit about the experience? Yeah, look, 12 passengers for the vice-faire, which is the first model coming in service by 2020-26. We'll have a two-pro operation, and we'll definitely have someone looking up the passengers. And he's usually able to eat their favorite snacks as they're flying for this. So the big thing is, I suppose, is it affordable? Is it going to be for the everyday passenger, the everyday traveler, the commute to work? This is really meant to be a transformational mode of technology. And so you mentioned at the beginning, it is all electric, which not only means there are zero emissions to reduce the overall carbon footprint of transportation but also being all electric means we don't have the same fuel costs we don't have the same maintenance costs as aircraft and those are really the two driving costs so being all electric we expect to have the cost of the tickets for trips around the islands. I've got so many Christians going through my mind but we do have to get to the news. We appreciate you guys meeting with this this morning and also showing us a prototype which I believe is the first time that you guys have shown it to the world as well. Shah Islam. And it's... It hasn't been unveiled officially yet. It two hours. So it's amazing, it's a great thing to see this. Amazing, exciting. Look Shah and Billy, thanks so much for joining us this one. We are excited for these to arrive and not so long, a couple of years from now, which will go really fast. Appreciate your time. Thank you very much. Thanks. We've got Chris Chaying now with the succeeding now with the succeeding, the succeeding, with the succeeding, the succeeding news. Thanks Indira. Prime Minister Jacinda Arden has touched down in Tokyo on the next leg of her first overseas trip since 2020. The Prime Minister will be in the Japanese capital for two days to discuss business, tourism and trade. The New Zealand delegation travelling with Ms Arden have completed compulsory COVID- saliva testing on arrival in Japan and are not allowed to leave their hotel rooms until the results come back. Some COVID-isolation requirements are being scrapped in New South Wales and Victoria this week. From tomorrow household and close contacts of confirmed COVID cases will no longer have to quarantine for seven days, but they will need to take daily rapid antigenogen tests, wear masks, indoors and work from home where possible. Hotel quarantine for unvaccinated international travellers in New South Wales will also end this week. It's a great day for our state. It's a day to also reflect on what we've come through. It has been a bloody tough two years. The state recorded just over 15,000 COVID cases yesterday and 15 deaths. Producers of the film Rust have been fined over the fatal shooting of a crew member on set last year. Cinematographer Haley Hutchins was accidentally shot dead by actor Alec Baldwin during rehearsals with what he believed to be a safe gun. The state of New Mexico issued the maximum fine of $205,000 and published a scathing report of the movie's production. The report said the crew demonstrated plain indifference to employee safety and willfully violated the rules. to sport and Russian and Belarusian tennis players had been banned from competing difference to employee safety and willfully violated the rules. To sport and Russian and Belarusian tennis players have been banned from competing at Wimbledon. The All England Clubs Committee says it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian and Belarusian players. It means world number two Daniel Medvedev and women's world number four Aunya Sabalanka. Plus, former world number one Victoria as a rancor will miss the tournament. Officials also said if circumstances change materially between now and June, they would reconsider their decision. one Apacifica have been dealt another super rugby blow with their game against the Western force this weekend postponed. A large number of players are unavailable due to COVID inside the force squad giving them no choice but to reschedule the match. It'll be the fourth game Moana Pacifica has had postponed. The remaining super games this week will all be played in Melbourne the first time the New Zealand sides will play the Australian franchises this year. And finally a border collie and a quick-thinking teenager being hailed as heroes. The pair praised, or raised the alarm rather, after our maintenance worker found himself trapped in a septic tank in Sydney. Channel 9's Emma Partridge has the story. Channel 9's Emma Partridge has the story. Spot the dog was spot on, the 10 month old board a collie, barking and running to the rescue. He was whimpering, whining, he started howling. Spot alerting, 13 year old Kayla, after a worker fell backwards into a septic tank in her backyard at Terry Hills about midday and became trapped. We found him in the hole upside down with his legs in the air and yeah I called the paramedic straight away. Spot alerted his owner, the beautiful Kayla, who made the call to triple zero. She showed a lot of maturity. He was saying the waters rising slowly and that kind of freaked me out because I really wanted to make sure he was okay. While on the phone to triple zero Kayla and her mother fed her rope down the hole. The man in his 40s clung onto it until firefighters extracted him and paramedics treated him and paramedics treated him for minor injuries. He knew it was a dog he said without that dog he was wondering how he was going he was going to get out so he was pretty happy. I'm a lover of dogs anyway especially bored of colleagues but yeah spots pretty incredible and without him it could have been a much different story. He's a bit of a hero. He's definitely the hero here really loves people and he knows if something's wrong he'll go nuts about it. And the reward for this local lassie. Big dinner, very big dinner and he's had many treats treats. That's gorgeous. That's all would be very very happy for the big feet. He's had many treats. So it's gorgeous. That's all would be very very happy with a big feed. Yeah. There was a beautiful story. Good dog. Is that what you say here? How breakfast? Good dog. But you say like this. Good dog. Good dog. They say it. Thank you so much for your feedback. We've been asking you this morning about the things that you used to be able to do as a kid that you wish that you could do now. And I love this one from Sam. I bought roller skates at the age of 47. thinking I could roll a skate with my daughter. I'd be an amazing bonding experience. I used to roll a skater as a kid all the time at the nine night at the nine night roller skating rink and I was so excited to get going well little did I know I couldn't do it at all and you know I reckon it's the fear part the fear factor that comes in as you get a little bit older knowing the consequences of actually oh yeah that mean so all over I know the limitations of my body now those old injuries coming back the mental game so so different Angela I'm 76 old. The other day she was walking along the path, she used to skip and walk, skip and walk, took her ages to coordinate her legs and actually lived her body up in the air as you skip from one to another, very hard, but her great-grandchildren wanted her to do a cart where she did try. Angela, you're amazing. Her feet never left the ground left the ground, though. We rolled around the ground ground though. We rolled around the lawn laughing. Go, Angela, that is awesome! I remember when my mum pulled out the skipping rope one day and all the kids just went. Nana can skip. They were blown away. So she did it. There was no... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know, and then walked off staunchly. Yeah, just like a little bit. like a boss lady. I don't want breakfast to be dragged into some sort of nasty lawsuit. If anyone wants to try to do things that they used to be able to do when they were kids, could be like wear pads and just send us a video? It's not on us, but if you do have an accident, send us a video. We'd love to take responsibility for your own actions. Great encouragement, Chris. breakfast and TVZ..........

So simple, Indy could drag and drop money with a swipe. Now they just had to agree on. Whose enough? Up three. How much bigger their family should be? Okay. Manage your money your way in the B&Z app. It's banking made simple with Bank of New Zealand. the cost of living crisis and with it skyrocketing inflation. The latest consumer price index figures are being released later this morning with predictions inflation will hit 7% higher than it's been here for more than three decades. Take a look at this graph. It shows New Zealand's inflation figures for the past 50 years starting from 1970 and as you can see during much of the 70s and throughout the 80s, inflation was running at close to 20% that's due to the like the oil crisis in the late 70s and the GST being introduced in 1986. Then after 1989 the Reserve Bank was given the responsibility of keeping inflation low a task it largely succeeded at until the past couple of years when inflation got away from from our central bank. Zooming in from Wellington to explain why costs are rising and what can be done to curb them we're joined by economic and political commentator Bernard Hickey. Morning, Bernard. How are you this morning? Thanks for joining us. Your honour? Wow, feeling great. Good. I mean, look, this is a conversation that we've been having for a long time here on this show, right? so can we start right?. right at the beginning, right at the beginning, right at the beginning,,,,., from the beginning, from the beginning, from the beginning, from the beginning, can we start right at the beginning Bernard and talk about the main factors driving our cost of living increases what are they? It's mostly food fuel and rent but there is inflation pressures right across bits of the economy in part because of the problems with COVID in our supply but also because there's been plenty of demand coming from here in New Zealand, from New Zealanders who've got a lot of cash through the COVID crisis or still have good jobs. And that is pushing up from the bottom from demand. And then the supply, which is short from the rest of the world because of COVID and now the Ukraine war, is from the other side and it's a it's a perfect storm that's pushed inflation over 7%. Now we've got Grant Roberts in our finance minister is saying that inflationary pressures are coming from offshore although I had a conversation with the national leader Chris of Alakson who's putting the blame at the government's feet. So who's right here or are they both equally wrong? Well you can say they're both right and they're both wrong because it's around about half and half. Half of the inflation is coming from the rest of the world through those fuel prices which we really can't do much about and of course food. Remember we're at record high food prices and because we produce a lot of our food but they're at international prices and we don't control them, then we have to pay the international price. But there is plenty of demand coming from New Zealand and the government was partly responsible for that through 2020 and 2021 when it pushed $20 billion in cash into the pockets of businesses in the form of wage subsidies and resurgence payments and some of that was spent. But also, remember, we've had a 40% increase in our house prices, so anyone who owned a home is feeling pretty pretty juicy. You know, they've gone out and done some spending. And of course, there was, you know, a good chunk of money we used to spend overseas. Now we're spending it here. That's helping to warm things up a bit in some areas. So it is partly in New Zealand and it's partly overseas and the government has a little role to play. I don't think as much as Christopher Luxon is saying, but it's there, particularly in construction and infrastructure and housing where it's buying as many houses and as many railroads and motorizes as it can, and that's pushing up some prices there and putting some extra stress on the system. Bernard, I want to talk about what can be done about this, but before we do have that conversation, we've got a couple of community groups that are coming on just after seven o'clock who are dealing with families that are really struggling at the moment. So I guess I want to break it down a little bit and simplify it a little bit more. So what will inflation look like and feel like for these families? Because I often feel that, you know, we get tied up in the words, inflation, monetary policy, reserve bank and it's, you know, it's hard for people to digest. So what does that actually mean for households? It means that you don't have enough money to fill a tank or you might miss some rent payments or in many cases you don't have enough money for food. We've seen demand that food banks in the last couple of years dip more than double a huge increase in applications for special needs benefits from MSD, and all sorts of signs of incredible stress, particularly that low to middle income area of the market, overcrowded houses, people needing temporary housing, all sorts of signs of stress. The government has helped out a little bit with some extra income, and from April 1, there's obviously been some benefit increases but according to those people who focus closely on the costs of living for those on the lowest incomes and how much income they're getting from various minimum wage jobs but also benefits they are in many cases hundreds of dollars a week below what they need just to basically survive and you've got to remember too that over the last 10 years inflation felt and was a lot worse for people on low incomes and beneficiaries because they spend a lot more of their income on food, on fuel, on transport, health and in in particular cigarettes and alcohol, taxes have risen much much faster than anywhere else. So combined, the inflation rate for those people, this is those who own a home and have a mortgage where their interest rates have dropped a lot, and they do some saving, those people on low incomes have felt inflation much worse, and unfortunately the inflation of their last couple of years has made it even worse because their incomes and their assets haven't kept up. Yeah, you're talking about those benefit increases that come in on the first of April and I'm pretty sure that the two community groups that we're going to be speaking to after seven o'clock would say that's actually making no difference whatsoever for for the families for the families at their scene. But the other interesting part about that too is having a conversation with Bernie O'Donnell from the Monaco-Urbamari Authority who deal with Alfano on a day-to-day basis. It's the working poor that they are now starting to see the changing face of poverty that is walking through the door. So if we look at that, we look at the issues that are happening overseas, the Ukraine, the Russia war, COVID, what actually can be done about this? Well the government's done one thing, which is to cut fuel tax and it had increased benefits, although it made that decision well before the Ukraine war and you could argue they should have topped it up even more and fair future the group of analysts who look at child poverty and incomes reckon that for a lot of families they should be receiving 200 to 300 dollars a week more in benefits just to keep up with inflation and the likes. So it would be great to see more income. Secondly, the government has helped with fuel excise, but it could also be much more aggressive at pushing at companies. So it's had a go at the supermarkets a bit, but also the fuel retailers and others to say, hey, actually, we've noticed that you've really increased your profits in the last year or so. Could you be increasing your prices more than your costs? What's going on there? I know it's only a waking of the finger, but it's amazing what happens when you get a awkward phone call from the fine minister or the finance minister, and that's something that government hasn't really used its pulpit to, you know, bully a few big businesses into keeping price inflation low. Burner we've got to wrap things up but I do want to end by asking you experts are predicting around 7% inflation the announcement coming out today what are you expecting how long do you expect this to continue but also any words of advice or encouragement for those who are watching who are potentially struggling now and could potentially be struggling in the not-so-distant future. Well there is some good news here most economists are saying the peak is just about here or maybe in the second quarter so in the June quarter of this year just over 7% is what most people are expecting and then it's expected to drop down. Remember that fuel prices have actually dropped a bit from a month or two ago, thanks in part to the fuel price that would be cut, and you're starting to see prices get very, you know, out of breath, very high and starting to fall back in part because consumers all around the world are seeing exactly the same thing and when they see that they have a shock a demand destruction shock and they go I'd rather not buy that then I'm going to change the way I do things maybe I'm going to travel less maybe I'm going to go out less maybe I'm just going to eat less maybe I'm going going to, you know, buy a smaller car, get an electric car, whatever it is, do whatever I can to reduce my consumption. And I think that's helpful and hopeful for those who are thinking, gee, if 7% is where it's start and it keeps going up, that's a real problem. But for most people who follow these things closely, they're seeing inflation starting to head down through the rest of this year and by the end of the next year getting towards three percent or so. Thank you for being helpful and hopeful this morning, Bernard Icki at the Kaka.com. Always a pleasure to talk to you Bernard. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Kiyatatoinamai.

Wake Up With Breakfast, proudly sponsored by Dilma T. Today's Breakfast Brew is strong and full-bodied, Dilma English Breakfast. Welcome back to breakfast. Three minutes to seven. Wimbledon officials have made a call to ban all Russian and Belarusian players from the Grand Slam this year for more on the seats go to our sports department. Zayen Dail. More than a brother. Good morning, Indira, yeah, that's right. The All England Club Committee making the decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players just due to the war in Ukraine. It's a stance many sporting bodies have taken since the conflicts started, Wimbledon officials said they felt it was their responsibility to take this measure and also reinforce their condemnation of what is going on in the Ukraine. It means world number two, Daniel Medvedvedev will miss the tournament alongside women's world number four, Irana Sabbath Saba Sabah. Now they both have been competing on their respective ATP and WTA tours under as individuals so not under their country's flags but not even that will get them a pass into Wimbledon in coming in June. If there are dramatic circumstances that change over in the Ukraine the All- the England Club Committee is open to reconsidering this measure. Yeah can't see that happening any time soon. So can we talk a little bit of the A&S, the A&S, which you know there's been COVID through a number of the teams so they haven't been able to play but one team was pretty stoked to be on court last night. Yeah well it's been over a month since the tournament started and the Northern Stars have only played three games and last night was their first at home. So yeah, they've played three games, they've only won two last night, they've won their third game against the mainland tactics. who they beat on the weekend, they are looking quite good, but they do have two games in hand. It's been a tough start to the season for them for them because if they weren't battling COVID cases in their squad other teams were which meant their games couldn't happen. But they're back on court, the tuckenini faithful were out there midweek supporting the Northern Stars there and they finally got a win. And I guess it sets their season up well because they do have games in hand and should they win they'll be fighting for a spot in the top two. A Zion did you actually go out? No I was going to but to be honest with you Jenny May after the big Easter weekend I'm still sort of recovering a little bit so I'll have a bit of an afternoon that. Awesome Zion. Thank you so much Zion. yeah no doubt we'll catch up with you a little bit later. thanks. thanks Zion. on, yeah, no doubt we'll catch up with you a little bit later. Thanks, I on. harder for families already struggling. It means you don't have enough money to fill a tank or you might miss some rent payments or in many cases you don't have enough money for food. We've seen demand that food banks in the last couple of years dip more than double. a huge increase in applications for special needs benefits from MSD and all sorts of signs of incredible stress. Overseas evacuation corridors are operating in Maripol allowing some civilians to flee the besieged Ukrainian city. More than 100,000 people remain trapped. Officials were hoping to evacuate 6,000 but say not that many have been able to leave. A Russian deadline for the last Ukrainian defenders in Maripole to surrender has passed with forces continuing to resist Russian attacks, but one Ukrainian commander has appealed for help. This is our appeal to the world. This could be the last appeal of our lives. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy at outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks. Scott Morrison and opposition leader Anthony Albanese have gone head to head in the first leaders debate of the Australian federal election campaign. Our one-use Australia correspondent Andrew McFarlane wraps up the action. Well the first election debate of the season has finally wrapped up it was on Sky News last night and in front of 100 potential voters and really it was a bit of a fizzer it was mainly focused on those policy points and less around the two personalities of the politicians. A wide range of topics were discussed China's influence in the Pacific, the aged care crisis and also COVID-19 going forward. However, if voters were looking for a clear winner, they probably didn't find one. Both our politicians had a pretty good suite of answers up their sleeves. A few zingers, one or two here and there, but really was all about their policy points as they go forward for May 21st polling day. The polls are showing and is going to be a tight one. So there are a few more debates yet for voters to have their say and see who they want to cast their ballot for. Two sport and one Pacifica had been dealt another, super rugby blow with their game against the Western Force this weekend postponed. A large number of players are unavailable due to COVID inside the force squad, giving them no choice but to reschedule the match. It will be the fourth game One of Pussifika has had postponed. The remaining super games this week will all be played in Melbourne the first time the New Zealand sides will play the Australian franchises this year. Let's have a look at how your weather is shaping up this morning, starting with some warnings for heavy rain in northern and western parts of the South Island, and the watch is in place for Taranaki. Heavy rain expected to hit later on this evening. Let's start on the North Muggy overnight, thanks to that humid northerly flow this morning. You can expect some showers. Those will get heavy from the afternoon..... You can expect some showers. Those will get heavy from the afternoon. 23 degrees the high for Fangare and Kaitehaiya. And a cloudy start of the day for this group. A few showers possible this morning, but those should really set in from the afternoon and evening. A high of 22 degrees for Taureangar and Fakatane. A pucky fine day over the East Coast. some northerlies for all of you, and expect the cloud to roll in later today in Masterton. You're getting to a high of 25 degrees and not quite so nice through here. A bit of gray for all of you, showers and Tom Nenui, Levin and Wellington, expected heavy rain for Taranaki. As we shoot across the Cook Strait, thunderstorms could be on the way for Nelson to the West Coast. As we shoot across the Cook Strait, thunderstorms could be on the way for Nelson through to the west coast. Rain is also possible and Blenheim and Kikeolda later today. You're getting to a high of 23 degrees. And rain to start and finish the day for most through Canterbury. Christchurch though, the morning showers should clear. You'll be left with a partly cloudy cloudy day. 26 degrees the high for you. And rain through here that'll be heavy all day for Milford Sound. Should clear for a time this morning for the rest though 21 degrees the high for Dunedin. Thanks for that Chris Chang. It is four minutes past seven. Now just a few minutes ago just before the seven o'clock go we heard from Bernatiki this morning about what's fueling the steep rise and inflation and now we're continuing that conversation with charities all too familiar with the reality of the cost of living crisis and how it's affecting those already doing it tough. Here with us in studio is Anna Ica and analysts with the Salvation Army. And zooming in from Kere-Kere is to race with with Bob from the Bald Angels Charitable Charitable Trust.. Zooming in from Kere-kerei is to race Wickbaum from the Board Angels Charitable Trust. Maureen Okoro, thank you both so much for joining us. Tarace, I'll come to you in a minute. I just want to start this morning's conversation with you. And I thank you so much for coming into the studio. So talk to me about the families that the Salvation Army is dealing with. And we're talking across the country, right? Right. across the country right? Yeah, more than that Jeni May, thank you for having, thank you for having me. The Salvation Army support over 140,000 Fano right across Altero, I mean so what we're seeing come through our doors, and with the majority of Fano they are already on limited and tight income and so when you have the price of living continue to increase and that creates a strain on the already limited income. I mean so what we're seeing coming through our doors is that Alfano have to make trade-offs, they have to make difficult decisions that they need to go out go without filling up the car or getting fruit and vegetables or being able to access food, food prices have increased by 7.6 percent and fruit and vegetable has increased by 18% and so that has real consequences for Alfano and the limited income that they have to be able to make those purchases for daily living. Torese can I bring you in here because I can see you nodding and I know we've had these conversations over and over again with some of the families that you are dealing with up in the far north as well. And the interesting thing for me is that we spoke to Bernie O'Donnell from the Monaco Urbanari Authority a couple of weeks ago and I used the word crisis in the introduction and he actually got a bit annoyed with me because he said we keep talking about this crisis. There's been families living in poverty for a long time now it's been a crisis for a long time it just hasn't appeared overnight. So what are you experiencing, Tarras? Moreina. Moreina, thank you for having me. Yes, yes, crisis sums it up for me but but crisis also feels like in here and now, and this is, this has been going on for as long as I've been here. I find it really distressing what's happening now, you know, families are already finding it incredibly tough. So many families are living without running water and electricity in the basic necessities already. And what will happen now and what we're seeing happening is as Bernard said, and as Anna said, they have to cut back somewhere when prices continue to rise. And what and we are cutting back is on things like car appears paying their power bills if they have power, children aren't going to school. It's because they don't have the clothes or there's simply not three dollars for a bus fare. But when you know what happens is it's a vicious vicious cycle and mental health is such a huge part of this if a family cuts back on car abuse and this we see this over and over daily then the car's not warranted they don't pay the redo they continue to drive the car unsafe because there's no other option, there's no public transport. Then they get, they might get a fine, and then they don't pay the fine because they simply don't have the money. And then they're getting so stressed, they're arguing, and then there's potential for increased drug abuse and violence and family harm and just complete breakdowns inside Fano. And the thing that really really concerns me, Jenny May, is that the children are growing up witnessing this learning by this behaviour. This becomes normal. I mean it is normal. It just is normal. But when we have inflation like this, it's going to increase all of these problems. It's going to exacerbate the already huge crisis we have here in New Zealand. It's actually, I find it completely unbelievable that our children are growing up with this type of normal. And parents are feeling like they're letting their families down, they're blaming themselves, they hate themselves, they're isolating more, they're losing sleep, so mentally, physically, socially, the whole system is breaking down inside Bano. And this is this this is the cycle that you're talking about right to race. So Anna we're talking about we're talking about families also with a whole lot of other issues, not just the financial ones that we're talking about, but a whole lot of other issues, right? So you know, complex needs, I guess, is what I'm trying to say? Yeah, absolutely. And we completely echo what Torees has said, you know, the financial hardship that Alfano were facing is just a fraction of the realities, you know, a know, a lot of our family that come through the doors come in with other challenges that they're facing. Like Terry said, we're family harm and addictions and financial hardship and crippling debt and housing issues. I mean, so I guess for us at the Salvation Army we're quite best to whether we have quite a wide array of services that we're able to wrap around. Our partner that walk through the doors, but the reality is when Alfano a living on these limited incomes, they don't have that financial buffer that a lot of families would have. And so, like to read when car repairs happen or an expensive dental cost, when a tungi happens, our fano who already in red pushed further into red and so they're accessing food banks which you know we have a lot of food banks in the community to support but then also we're seeing a lot of fano because they're pushed to their brink they're accessing loan sharks and so that creates a crippling debt that has that takes years and years for us to be able to support our fun out of their financial freedom. But yeah because financial hardship is just a fraction of their complex needs. It has the ability to be able to perpetuate the you know addictions and family harm that they're facing and so if we can try to prevent that by addressing these financial hardships from the beginning then we try to do as much as we can. Yeah and I guess that's the... I want to end this conversation on what solutions that we could possibly put forward in order to help our families to help our finding lifting them out of poverty and I know that on the first of April benefits went up and we had social development Minister Carmel Sepulone say on breakfast that she said the benefit increases that kicked in at the start of April will outweigh the cost of living crisis and I imagine that the response from both of you is going to be it's making bug or all difference I mean you tell me yeah I mean from the Salvation Army's perspective it's made no difference for our Fano, the cost of living has outweighed welfare increases and we acknowledge, you know, the we egg recommendations and we support that. And we're disappointed that it's come this late, but it's not enough, our families, it's not making a difference when you're looking at the price of food, the price of gas, the price of housing. Yeah, so I guess for us here at the Salvation Army, it's not enough. Torese, I want to get you to respond to that. And I mean, you know, I said bugger all, but I mean, it was something, right? so we have to acknowledge that in the first instance, but is it making a difference for the final that you're dealing with the families? Look everything every little thing that's done to help is worthwhile and it's acknowledged but it's nice in theory you know like way raising the minimum wage. It's lovely in theory and on payday it might look better but at the end of the week nothing left because when we raise the minimum wage for example all the costs go up so you know it's it's not doing anything all we're doing it just moving everything up yeah and it feels deceptive I don't know how to explain it but But you know, for Bald Angels, just in the last six months, well actually just since February, we have distributed over 2,000 items of warm clothing and bedding, just in the far north. We paid for car repairs, so moms can get to work. We've provided mental and support for Fana and Rangatahi and food parcels over 400. Yeah I can see Anna's here in the studio and she's she's nodding her head at the same time and you're both dealing with the same issues with our families. I'm really sorry we're going to have to finish our conversation here and we didn't even get to the solutions but I do want to talk solutions so I'd love to have you both back because again you are on the front line you were both dealing with our families and so I know that you have both dealing with our families and so I know that you have ideas around solutions so in the first instance I just want to say thank you so much for being here and being the voice for for those who don't for those.

People coming to New Zealand on working holiday visas are now being welcomed back. The hospitality and primary sectors in particular are experiencing worker shortages right now. And it's hoped that opening up to working holidaymakers might ease the pressure. Workers from countries with uncapped schemes are all welcome now, and those from countries with capped schemes are progressively being welcomed back. Working holidaymakers who previously had a visa to come here, but were blocked by our COVID border restrictions, can now get a 12-month working holiday visa.

A record $1.9 billion investment was committed to addressing New Zealand's mental health crisis back in 2019. And just last month, the Mental Health and Well- Being Commission reported services are not changing fast enough for young people. Mari and Bassifika. So here's what Mental Health Foundation's Chief executive Sean Robinson told us about that yesterday. We really have not got the systematic change that we're looking for and a lot of time has been wasted. We are starting to get some traction now but you know, out of my it's been nearly three years since those commitments were made and you know frankly there's being too many drop balls. And it's got the National Party calling for the order to general to look into the government's mental health spending leader Christopher Lixen telling us yesterday what he would do to fix the system. I personally want to have a dedicated mental health minister Matt Ducey who's a mental health practitioner build his career in that way because I think it needs really dedicated focus in New Zealand. It's been a lost agenda I'd say for 30 years in New Zealand. So to respond to all of that I'm joined now by health minister Andrew Little, more than a minister, Mr thank you for your time this morning. This was, I do want to acknowledge the well-being budget, the record $1.9 billion investment, this was always a four to five year plan. The government has always said that from day one. But we are three years into this commitment and you heard from Sean Robinson himself. He didn't even see a glimpse of the systematic change that the industry, the sector, the sector, really needs at this moment. it's not just what national party saying or what people in the sector is saying or what people in the sector, or what people in the sector, the sector, the sector, the sector, the sector change that the industry the sector really needs at this moment. It's not just what National Party is saying or what people in the sector are saying. I went on social media last night just to take a look at some of the comments to the interviews you've been making in the past couple of weeks. And what people have been wondering is how that money was spent. So what assurances can you give the New Zealand taxpayer as to how effectiveness, how effective that investment has been so far? Yeah, so look there were a number of elements to that package but the centerpiece was the work we're doing with primary care so we funded currently now over nine hundred four-time equivalent roles in primary care so that are people in GP clinics, community health clinics, copper and mighty health providers, Pacific Health providers and youth health services. And they are there to be a free service for people with mild to moderate mental health issues. That was what the report in 2018 said the Haredordana report. They said the biggest gap is for people needing help with mild to moderate mental health issues. That's what we focused on. That's the priority we've given. We are part-way through as you've acknowledged that rolled out. We've not got another sort of a couple years to go. We have a courage at the moment of an enrolled patient population of about two million. So that is happening, that's real. I get around I meet the people, I meet the people doing the receiving end of the stories of the differences that they're making. I've even met some of the people who have been on the receiving end of those services and they talk about what a difference that it's made just being able to have something to talk to or to give them guidance on the stuff that this sort of has overtaken their lives or their thinking whether it's their weight whether it's traumatic, the they've dealt with more recently, that stuff is happening and it's real and it's making a difference. Well what do you make of the comments in the report though? The report certainly showed statistics that have gotten worse since 2016, including wait times for young people. And that's despite, you know, the policies like the child and youth well-being strategy that the government put in place to prioritise young people. Another really concerning statistics was the number of Maori in solitary confinement, which has gone up since 2016, and they're sitting at 48% I think it is, which that just screams of injustice. So two things there. We know that I talked a lot about the primary carrying, so the end that when people go to the doctor that's that stuff people who do get seriously unwell with mental health issues who do need specialists and acute help it is true to say that look we haven't put a lot more investment in that area we're build rebuilding some facilities but that is in the area where there's ongoing work needed which is what I think the mental health and well- Commission was saying. On the issue of young people look we we put more resources into schools we've doing the work now to lay the foundation to to roll out the program called Mana, which we put into Christchurch and Kolkata into more places right across New Zealand. So we are addressing those needs for young people including quite quite young people, because we know that those issues are growing in our schools at the moment. That stuff is happening, the foundations have been laid for that. That is part of the ongoing work that we're doing. Speaking of that ongoing work, can you say that you are addressing these needs, but with all due respect, Minister, since this record 1.9 billion dollar investment was announced 1235 people in New Zealand have died of suspected suicide and I'm not even counting figures from the last 10 months with which are due to come out in a couple of months from the coroner's office so is there a sense of urgency with this rollout? There absolutely is and that's that's why we've embarked on it. That's why when we came into government in 2017, mental health services had been neglected. Pretty much for the whole previous term of the previous government, the independent monitor of mental health services, the mental health commissioners at the end was abolished in 2012 by that government. They just turned their back on it. We commissioned the report, we got the report, it said give priority to those with mild to moderate mental health needs because if we provide the support there, then we prevent people going on to the more serious end of mental health services. It doesn't mean to say we need to do more of that more serious end, but we need to kind of nip things in the bad way we can. That's what we've done. We put more into schools, we put more into helping young people, more into Marty and Pacific Health Services. All that stuff is happening. This is all being reported on too by the way. Interesting, the National Party wants to go to the Auditor General. In addition to the nearly 2,000 questions that Matt DC's asked me, written questions and got a heap of information, a heap of information, down, including by the Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission and the Department of Prime Minister Cabinet's Implementation Unit, reviewing what has been happening, saying that it's on track, saying that it's achieving what was needed. So there's plenty of independent reporting on just what is being done. Can I just make a note to you, Minister, that breakfast asked for records of how the 1.9 billion dollar was a budget was spent starting from February last year it took about eight months to get even a breakdown of where all that money has gone and even in the records that we have there is a significant lag between the money that has been allocated and committed to and compared to the money that has actually been spent on the ground with service providers. How much of the 1.9 billion dollars has actually been spent on the ground with service providers how much of the 1.9 billion dollars has actually been spent on the ground to date Well because the money was spaced over four years, so there's money that was spent in you know in the various financial years and we're in the Third of those financial years and the way because most of this work is worked delivered by other organizations is not necessarily delivered by DHPs or those in the kind of full part of public sector. Are those providers and even the DHBs? Are they reporting to you regularly as to how they're spending that money? Yes they have to but but the point I'm making is that you sign a contract for the delivery of those services, at that point you're committed. So we regard that as funding that is committed. It might be paid out on a monthly basis, on invoice or whatever, but we're not going to get out of that contract. We're not going to cancel it, and we're committed to that. So that's the basis on which it is reported. Right. Minister, just quickly as we go, this is the last question, but what is happening with the five capital health projects being managed by the DHBs? I know has construction even begun and when do we expect those services to be up and running? Yes, they have done. And there's the last big project that has yet to have their design completed or finally approved. There's the one in Y culture,el was the biggest of the project, about $100 million. That cost will have gone up now but where we'll meet that extra cost. That is due for approval in a matter of weeks. Construction will then commence if it's not late this year, it'll be the early part of next year. But those projects are all well underway. These were facilities that had been long neglected, long-needed rebuilding and were in the process of doing that. Minister, Minister of Health Andrew Little, thank you so much for joining us this morning to respond to that. We will be right back with your 730 news after the break.

Salvation Army analyst Anna Iika says the rising cost of living is having a big impact on the lives of their fano. What we're seeing coming through our doors is that Alfano have to make trade-offs. They have to make difficult decisions that they need to go without filling up the car or getting fruit and vegetables or being able to access food, food prices have increased by 7.6% and fruit and vegetable has increased by 18% and so that has real consequences for Alfano. Prime Minister Jacinda Arden has touched down in Tokyo on the next leg of her first overseas trip since 2020. The Prime Minister will be in the Japanese capital for two days to discuss business, tourism and trade. The New Zealand delegation travelling with Ms Arden have completed compulsory COVID-saliva testing on arrival in Japan and are not allowed to leave their hotel rooms until the results come back. Officials say far fewer civilians then hoped have been able to flee the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariopole. More than 100,000 people remain trapped. Authorities had initially planned to evacuate 6,000 people in buses. A Russian deadline for the last Ukrainian defenders in Maripolto surrender has passed with forces continuing to resist Russian attacks. But one Ukrainian commander has appealed for help. This is our appeal to the world. This could be the last appeal of our lives. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks. Some COVID isolation requirements are being scrapped in New South Wales and Victoria this week. From tomorrow, household and close contacts have confirmed COVID cases will no longer have to quarantine for seven days, but they will need to take daily rapid andogen tests, wear masks and doors and work from home where possible. Hotel quarantine for unvaccinated international travellers in New South Wales will also end this week. Great day for our state. It's a day to also reflect on what we've come through. It has been a bloody tough two years. The state recorded just over 15,000 COVID cases yesterday and 15 deaths. Producers of the film Rust showed plain indifference to employee safety according to an investigation into the fatal shooting of a crew member on set last year. Cinematographer Haley Hutchins was accidentally shot dead by actor Alec Baldwin during rehearsals with what he believed to be a safe gun. The state of New Mexico issued the maximum fine of $205,000 and published a scathing report of the movie's production. The report said the crew willfully violated safety rules. A US lawyer wants to sue social media companies for choosing profits over people. Matthew Bergman says the dopamine response a person's brain gets from social media is equal to a bump of cocaine. He says social media companies are taking advantage of the addictive nature of their products, causing severe mental illness. We've seen a number of cases involving children who take their lives as a result of social media addiction. Many cases of attempted suicide, eating disorders, cyber bullying. According to Bergman, an increase in teen suicides in the US since 2008 coincides with the rise of social media. To sport and Russian and Belarusian tennis players have been banned from competing at Wimbledon. The All England Clubs Committee says it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian and Belarusian players.

Manchester City had the chance to regain top spot on the English Premier League ladder this morning. City set two points behind Liverpool but a win over Brighton this morning will put them back in the lead. Both teams remain scoreless heading towards half-time but it's been a high scoring first half between Arsenal and Chelsea with the score locked at two or... I locked his cheek setting up the chance! I'll see a look at how your weather's shaping up around the country this morning, starting off with some warnings for heavy rain and northern and western parts of the South Island. A watch is also in place for Taranaki. Heavy rain expected to hit later this evening. Right, but start on the north with this pretty jazzy lounge music. I like it. Muggy overnight for many of you here thanks to the humid northerly flow. This morning you can expect a few showers. Those will get heavy from the afternoon. 23 degrees the high for Kaitaya, Fangare, and Auckland. And a cloudy start here as well. A few showers possible this morning, those should really set in from the afternoon an evening, a high of 22 degrees for Todangar and Fakathani. Fine day over in the East Coast. Some northerlies for all of you, and expect the cloud to roll in later in Masterton 25 degrees the high for you. It's not quite so nice through here though, a bit of a gray day for all of you. Showers and Tomarawi, Leven and Wellington, heavy rain expected later in Taramaki. Across the Cook Strait, thunderstorms could be on the way for Nelson through to the west coast. Rain also possible in Blenema and Kekoda later today. 23 degrees you're high. And rain to start an end the day for most of you through White Tahar Canterbury. Christchurch though the morning showers should clear you're left for the partly cloudy day at a high of 26 degrees. And rain in the deep south that will be heavy. All day in Milford Sound should clear for a time this morning for the rest of you 21 degrees the high for Dunedin. Nice Chang man, your reading of the weather that is as opposed to the rain for most of the country. Thank you so much for your feedback this morning.

But we had a big mass of hill that we used to go down and I don't know if you guys remember the roller skates obviously the wheels on but there was a big rubber stop. Yes. In the front. Yeah. When you're going at high speed you didn't want to put your foot down. Oh especially going down a hill.. Oh especially going down a hill. Yeah a few few excellence.

It is coming up to quarter to eight. Periods are a pain. Pun intended, the cramps, headaches, hormones, and on top of all of that work. It's a lot. And for the first time in Ottawa, a company's policies are recognizing that. Pacific Media Network has just implemented a menstrual leave policy for employees. So for more we are joined by the woman behind this initiative, to Union delegate and broadcaster, Lucia Petella, welcome, sister, and congratulations. Thank you. So take us back to how this all started. This started back in mid-21. So it started as, got together as an union collective and before we have a bargaining session with management, we sit down, we're like, hey, what do we want to ask of management? What is it we need? What is it that we want? And this just happened to be one of the claims that one of our sisters brought forward and it was weird because in my mind I was like how did you even come up with that like you know but what happened was she is an announcer herself she had called it all about it on air and a colleague's family member happened to be listening and they asked them what does your work do about you know periods in general and they were like I don't know so it kind of led from there she introduced it in this meeting and then my job from then onwards was cool like let's fight for this and get this menstrual menopause leave so when you had that hoey before you took it to the board or before you took it to your boss and your colleague brought it up what was the what was the feeling like in the room at that point in time? Because I could imagine people go, what? You know, what is this? It was actually mixed, because some were like, what the heck? And some were like, oh my God, that's so cool for me, like because I was sitting there as a delegate. I was just like, how am I going to do this? I'm going to do this? You know? I'm looking at a room of people who are putting their faith and trust in me to do this money. And so I was like, okay, but the best thing I remember about being in that room that day was our brothers, our uncles, our men in the room, they were so supportive. Like they were like, go for it, like we fully support you. and my right hand man is the delegate is my co-host on the rush is Henry Hedon-Hoehenberger and man he let me tell you he stood up for women all over the world in their negotiating room because I couldn't have asked for a better partner to fight for this fight with me so yeah, mad love to Henry. Shot Henry and so then you had to take this proposal to your male boss. How did that go down? Initially it was like, puh-pah-puh, it was rejected. I mean leading up to it as well, like both management and myself and my team and Eugene who represents the air to union who looks after us. We all, everyone did their homework management, ourselves, we reached out to GP doctors, I know our management reached out to Modi Bode in Australia, they're like, Iowa, here in Ottawa. And so, you know, everyone did their own homework and when we came into that meeting room, announced like this is the claim, excuse me, when we came back for the next meeting, that's when I got the no. And honestly, as Don was talking to me, in my head I was like, I'm so annoyed. Like, you know, just my mind is like, he's saying this and this is my response in my mind, of course. We break away, we came back, and you know, one of the reasons that I felt that I needed to share was as a media company, you know, we, like yourselves, like you share everybody's amazingness around the world and if something's breaking or is exciting and just has an impact on our community, we share it on 531 PI and Newfoundland, and I thought why are we sharing other people's, you know, work if we're not going to be... advocate for ourselves. We talk about breaking stigmas and taboos and we have to call it or about it on air but we are not doing something about it in our own space and I think it's important that as we went along the way it was important to make sure that space was safe as well. I know Don, Don man, he's a good man, good boss. So how did he come around in the end? Man, honestly I have to say it's teamwork because everyone, as I sit here and do these interviews, you know, I know as much as I was part of the journey, I, Don Henry, you, and you run, it was definitely teamwork and I believe that the yes came because the reasons I gave back were from my heart. It started as I did this for the women of the union collective at PMN. In the winter, man, this is bigger than the collective. It's PMN, the brand. And then I was like, damn, this is for women. Like, you know, as people are saying to me, we're like, there's no other company in New Zealand. if there is, that's what got the win. We're all like, there's no other company in New Zealand. If there is, that's amazing. We just haven't heard that they have. And so I spoke from the heart. That is the honest truth. When they said no, and I was just like, I was frustrated, supported. And yeah, I think that's what got the win. You're also talking about your own experiences, experiences, of other women in your life as well. So the policy is that you now have 12 days leave during the year. Let's try. Yeah, let me tell you when when I asked for 12 and they said yes this was my face. I just thought my jaw opened for like ages but yes it's 12 days just like a normal sick day you know you contact your manager and if you offer a few days and they're like wait for too long so you know medical so if required. But yeah but this time it just means our women sisters aunties get to use that if because of Metro or Menopause related. Well watch other organizations in Althoro follow suit for the change that you have made and so proud of you and congratulations you for getting that across the line not just for the women in your company but also I think this is going to make a difference for a lot of women everywhere. Lucia Petello, a broadcaster and Etshu Union advocate from PMN. Thank you for joining. Thank you ladies.

That's a record number of kids needing food, clothes, shoes and more. So to see how they're managing Isaac Gonson's heading back to school, visiting a Koyangario in Christchurch where the need is more pronounced than ever. More than Isaac! a whole lot more or a whole who-hoo-hoo. A beautiful early childhood education center here in Ototahi Christchurch. Today is Thursday and at around 9 o'clock Tamariki will flood in here. Same with tomorrow. But on Monday there'll be a few less here, probably. Probably, obviously public holiday, notwithstanding. To explain a little bit about why Mondays are a little bit quieter. We're here, to be joined by Alicia who's an administrator here at this Kohangarer. More than Alicia, how are you? I'm Mahil Tata, Isaac, I'm Katoiro. Tell us a little bit about Mondays. What are they look like here? Why are they a little less busy? So on Mondays we usually have 75% of our mokupano attending and that's due to their far no, their caregivers working or studying full-time. And so having to earn a little bit of extra money and just this all's you know having them not coming in on on a Monday that's you know one fifth of the week that's one fifth of their weekly education. What sort of impact is that having on Tamariki here? I mean we would prefer to have our mokopono in full time but yeah just with the current economic climate some some Fano just aren't able to. Yeah and we're talking about the cost of living there aren't we? Is is it becoming too much for Fano here? I wouldn't say too much but it is definitely a strain personally for myself. It's a strain. Yes. And so we just heard in the intro there that KidsCan is supporting a record number of schools nearly a thousand across the country. There are 11 schools I believe are on the waiting list and 32 early childhood education centres. That includes you, doesn't it here? Yes that does. So we've been on the waitlist since October last year and we're not quite sure when we will be able to get a support from Kids Can, to be able to support Afano within our Puhan. One of the most interesting things that I heard from Kids Can was that they're saying that they're not a hundred percent sure that where they can rely on support support anymore because for the first time in a very long time they've actually had less support coming. If there are people watching thinking I would love to support kids' care because it would help early childhood education centers like yours or schools, what would your message to those people be? It would just simply be to get a hold of kids can go on their website and get contact details and speak to Sarah. Yeah I think it's an awesome copappa that should be fully supported, fully funded so that we can get kai in the puku of our Tamariki. And what would it mean, you know, here, how much of a difference would it make in the classroom on a sort of daily basis? would the classroom feel? For me personally as a working Fano member and we have two times incomes where both parents work it would just be a massive reprieve for myself not having to provide a certain aspect of their of my kids daily learning whether that be clothes also just the preparation and planning and organizing as a working mother yes that would definitely give myself and some of our fun a bit of a pre from that. And what does it look like at the moment do you find yourselves having to go a bit above and beyond to look after Tamari here? I think we to go a bit above and beyond to look after Tamari here? I think we always go above and beyond. I mean the Kohangar ourselves with our Kaai Mahe. We treat all Kohangar as if they were our own. We love them as if they were our own. And that's something that has been a staple within the Kaipapa for over 40 years. Aliciaa we can't thank you enough for joining us this morning and if you can help Kids Can do reach out to them that some of their support has fallen in recent months but obviously in a time like this when the cost of living is so high the support that they can offer to schools in early childhood education centres is so important. nice ten o'clock where Isaac and you can go to Kidscan.org.Nz if you can help out. We've been talking feedback this morning, thank you so much, as always, for giving us a bit of a laugh actually this morning, because we've been talking about things that you used to be able to do when you're a kid, that maybe you can kind of still do or you can't do at all we've had roller skating has been a big one this morning from many of you talking about doing that as a kid and wanting to do that now but actually you can't. A lot of gymnastic pursuits as well aren't we've people splitting, jumping, can't we half, flipping, splitting and half. I love this by Shannon as a mom who's given birth three times can totally relate. She goes, running, seriously, running as an adult after nursing three babies is not good at all, even with the best support. Cheyenne just don't go tramplinging like I did. Oh, not the game. Clean is slowing on the grass, sunbathing and then being able to get up about having to go get up and fire a brigade. Ah yeah, it takes me about half an hour to get back up off the ground. Thank you so much for your feedback. We're loving it this morning and keeping it, keep it coming, and breakfast at TVZ. dot co.anzids.. Let's say the eight o'clock here is Chris Changang with the news. inflation is expected to hit 7% later today, higher than it's been here for more than three decades. Economic commentator Bernard Hickey says it will make the cost of living just that much harder for families already struggling. It means you don't have enough money to fill a tank or you might miss some rent payments or in many cases you don't have enough money for food. We've seen demand that food banks in the last couple of years dip more than double. A huge increase in applications for special needs benefits from MSD and all sorts of signs of incredible stress. Despite 1.9 billion dollars of funding the government is being accused of not doing enough for for mental health. The funding was announced as part of the 2019 well-being budget. Three years on there are accusations that not much has changed. Health Minister Andrew Little says primary care was the main focus of the 2019 budget. We funded currently now over 900 four-time equivalent roles in primary care so that are people in GP clinics, community health clinics, Kappa Pamati health providers, Pacific Health Providers and youth health services. And they are there to be a free service for people with mild to moderate mental health issues. overseas evacuation, Corrid was operating in Mudiopole, allowing some civilians to flee the besieged Ukrainian city. More than 100,000 people remain trapped. in Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Zalenski has made another plea for military aid. It is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing for years. If they have the weapons Ukraine needs, if they have the ammunition we need, it is their moral duty to help protect freedom. Prince Harry has spoken about his surprise visit with the Queen in an interview with American TV. Relationships with other members of his family may be strained, but Prince Harry is still on good terms with his grandmother. While the Prince admitted he doesn't know if he'll return to the UK for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June, he told the NBC he's trying to ensure she's protected. It was just so nice to see her, you know, she's on grateful. We have a really special relationship. We talk about things that she can't talk about with anybody else. She's always got a great sense of humor with me and I'm just making sure that she's, you know, protected and got the the right people around her. said to welcome a new means of sea travel, but it's not what you'd expect. A 700 million dollar deal will see 25 sea glider passenger planes come to New Zealand, which fly 10 meters above the ocean surface. Regent CEO Billy Thalheimer says the electric gliders could revolutionize our carbon footprint. It's really meant to be a transformational mode of technology. And so you mentioned at the beginning it is all-electric, which not only means there are zero emissions to reduce the overall carbon footprint of transportation, but also being all-electric means we don't have the same fuel costs. We don't have the same maintenance costs as aircraft, and those are really the two driving costs. A team of MIT-trained X Boeing engineers are developing the game-changing sea glide at the first batch gliding into Altaeroa by 2025. Two sport and Juanapasifika have been dealt another super rugby blow with their game against the Western Force this weekend postponed. A large number of players they know are available due to COVID inside the four squad, giving them no choice but to rescheule the four squad giving them no choice but to reschedule the match. It will be the fourth game one a Pacifica has had postponed. The remaining super rugby games this week will all be played in Melbourne. The first time the New Zealand sides will play the Australian franchises this year. The fight for the top spots in the English Premier League is heating up this morning. it's been a high scoring affair between Arsenal and Chelsea. The gunners are pushing for a spot in the top four, while Chelsea sit comfortably in third. Minutes into the second half, Arsenal lead three two. Taking on Sar this time. Eartha guard......... coming on to it is Smith Row, it is a brilliant finish. nicely done by now, good Pauline, it's too too. And Manchester City have a chance to regain top spot. They remain scoreless against Brighton with the second half about to start. Yeah, Moana Pacifica cannot catch a break, can they? I know. And it's like, I don't know, the whole, the integrity of the competition, it's kind of like, you know, it just feels, it feels like a bit of a fizzard, isn't it? It's a couple of good games lately, but... And like, but this is the times that we're living it, right? with one of the team members or management getting it so it means oh well there's no game for a week which you know it doesn't help in terms of having a week off where you are not able to do anything in terms of training and then turn up you know a couple of days later and then have to have to play it it's just it's just the things that we have to deal at this point in time. especially gutting though I think with Monoposific this was their entry into Central Rapids. So exciting. Yeah. Yep. It is at times. I love the look of these sea gliders though. I know right. I see Peter Berlin Blair chook maybe helping those as they sail into New Zealand. Well he was talking about foils and all of that it sounded really quite similar. 10 meters above the ground. We. We don't have the America's Cup here anymore but sea gliders. Yeah, get a few of those. Yeah, that freaked me out. Yeah, really? Yeah, well of course we're talking about gliders that sit not far above the water, right? So cruising along technology that we're probably going to see in a couple of years time, fully electric. as well. this is a conversation you had earlier this morning, in Dera, yeah, no, yeah, cool, yeah, you do you, Boo. They take a while to charge, so if it's fully electric. Just make probably swim, I'll just get on the ferry and cruise across. How do you weigh in a couple hours? Yeah, I'm all good with that. All good with that.. Anywho. Changman, how's having our weather? I would, I'd, on whether I would wonder how they would go and weather, bad weather for instance, yeah, I'm certain to being above the clouds, questions for these news. They are the fairy. All right, let's have a look at your weather for today, starting off of some heavy rain and a western and, you've got a watch in place for the clouds, questions for these news for these news. They are on the fairy rain is expected later on this evening. To the north muggy overnight for many of you thanks to some humid northerly flows. This morning though a few showers in store they're going to get heavy from the afternoon, 23 degrees the high for Kaitaya Fangaray and Auckland and cloud through here as well with those showers coming as well this morning. They should set in again from the afternoon and evening a high of 22 degrees for Todangar and Pokatani. A pucky fine day over the East Coast. Some northerlies for all of you and expect the cloud to roll in later today and masterton. It's 25 degrees the high there. It's not quite so much of a quite so nice of a picture through here though. A bit of a gray day. Showers and Tom Anui Leven and Wellington. Heavy. Heavy.ven and Wellington, heavy rain expected later in Taranaki. Across the Cook Strait, thunderstorms could be on the way for Nelson through to the west coast. Rain also possible in Glenham and Kekhala later today. 23 degrees, rather, the high for Kekkoda. And rain to bookend of the day for most of you through White Tahoe Canterbury. Christchurch though, the morning showers should clear. then you left with a partly cloudy cloudy cloudy day getting to a partly cloudy day getting to a high of 26 and rain for all of you through here that will be heavy all day and Milford Sound should clear for a time this morning for the rest of you 21 degrees the high for Dunedin. Thanks Changman. Eight minutes past day we are heading across the Tasman now where the the Australian federal election is heating up Larissaissa Howe has the fallout from the leaders debate. Slugging it out in front of 100 undecided voters in Brisbane, Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese have faced off in their first leaders debate. You're always looking for a division. Not looking for an accuracy. No, no, I'm just looking for the accuracy and the truth. Taxing questions on aged care, housing and the economy. Our debt has risen because it had to, because we all know when we went into the pandemic, we were facing the biggest economic crisis we had seen since the Great Depression. This government have held us back. You've got to, you can't be scared of the future, you have to shape the future, otherwise the future will shape you. But it took 25 minutes for the two potential p.m. to get into a spat, Mr. Albanese stumbling over his immigration track record. Now what we have the same position on as well is accepting the deal that was there from New Zealand that has been on the table since Julia Gillard and John Key all those years ago decided it a decade ago. I'm sorry, we were not proposing... I'm sorry, we were not proposing... You were not... Turn back to our policy before the 2013 election, I was the shadow immigration minister. Scott Morrison, not without slip-ups of his own. I have a four-year-old autistic son. Can you please tell me what the future of the NDIS looks like? Kenne and I have been blessed. We've got two children that haven't had to go through that. And so for parents with children who are disabled, I can only try and understand. Giving voters plenty to think about before they head to the ballot boxes next month. Lewis Howey One News. Also watching the debate last night was Australia correspondent Andrew McFarlane. We will bring him in now for all the analysis. Morena Andrew, I was hoping that we'd get some kind of spicier grabs given this is a first debate, kind of exciting, but what was your take? Was it a fizzo? Yeah, Morena Indira, I have to agree. I think it was a bit of a fizzo. And I mean, we're quite used to some pretty good debates in Al-Tiaroa between our two leaders when it comes to an election. And especially with as being the COVID election for Australia, I think most people were expecting this one to be, as you say, spicy, right? But it was really quite focused on the policy, when they, you know, it's like, we often get caught up in the personality of the politicians and we all quite like it when they you know fight it's like you know us cheering them on from the ring but the reality is they were focusing on their policy promises and that might have been a good thing however I don't think anyone really came out as the number one winner out of that one it all seemed really really pretty civilised. And we saw some people there sitting there in the debate. These were a hundred undecided voters. They had 90 minutes to try and win this debate in front of them. First of all, how are these undecided 100 voters chosen? Well, it's a pretty wide selection and these ones have all come from Queensland. That's proving to be the place where where the election is going to be hard fought. In 2019 that was the place that really swung it for Scott Morrison. So they're coming from a place which is really going to weigh a lot in the election. Of course every vote counts but these are the people in last general election here, sorry the last federal election, those are the people who really counted the most when it came to polling day. and as they were asked at the very end of the debate last night who they thought one. So the pundits can have their say and everyone else, you can probably hear some very noisy birds here in Australia right now. The pundits say what they say on who they thought one, but actually it comes down to those 100 people in the room, right. And surprisingly, 25% of them a full quarter of every run in that room was still undecided after that debate so still a lot to play for but the other people really Anthony Albany came out as number one there in that room and I think possibly a few of the political editors and annala people doing the analysis over here thought Scott Morrison had taken away just by whisker. Right So what are the polls saying? Well polls recently have certainly tightened. We've started to see Anthony Albanese's popularity poll drop a little bit. Polls can't be trusted here in Australia though. No one really wants to commit to those being the Bible. Right. Last time in 2019 they were all saying Bill Shulton was going to win the election and then Scott Morrison came out with what he called a miracle right. So the polls are saying Anthony Albanese is likely to win from a party perspective but his personal popularity has dropped a bit. Whether last night's debate though will have influenced many people is also another question. Surprisingly the two leaders faced off on Sky News. Now it sounds like it's a pretty big channel but actually not many people have it over here. It's a pay TV channel and not many people are paying for cable TV here in Australia these days. So actually the proportion of people who were physically watching along with that debate would be quite small. It's going to be a little bit later on when the the big networks over here say nine and seven have their versions of the debate and those ones I think are really where people will be tuning in. Andrew Scott Morrison has only been Prime Minister since 2018 he's had just over a term and before that there was a lot of people will remember a lot of change with the political leadership there in Australia is there an appetite in Australia for a change this soon? Well that's kind of the cornerstone of Scott Morrison's campaign. You've got two versions of this right, you've got Scott Morrison who's only had one term as leader but his party has been in power for quite a while. They've been in power I believe for around a decade now. So the question he's trying to pose to voters, do you want to stick with me? He's calling that stability and confidence that you know who I am, what I'm doing as I go forward, or do you want to risk the change and the risk of a new leader who you don't know so well? On the other hand, though, Anthony Albanese, he's using that as a cornerstone of his debate right, saying you've had three years of Scott Morrison, you know what he's like, why not change it up? not much as known about the leader of the opposition from this end in Altheioo. So Skoma versus Albo, tell us about Anthony Albinizi, what's he like, what's his background, where he's come from? He kind of likes to paint himself as a man at the people, right? So it's quite often you'll see him doing the rounds, wearing, sometimes the cowboy hat, as you see on the campaign trail, you know, in a farming situation, but it's all about, you know, he wants to appeal to the working class photo. That's what Labour's all about obviously. And Anthony Elbinee, he says he comes from, you know, a single mum household, he knows the value of work and that's the message he's trying to drill in, especially as the pressures of the economy sort of the economy sort of start to buy. Especially as the pressures of the economy sort of to buy an average Joe right now with inflation. He wants to paint that picture, he's trying to drill in, especially as the economy, as the He may not know the OCR or the unemployment rate as he was caught out in that interview, but he's trying to send this message that he is in tune with average Australians, but Scott Morris is trying to do that as well, but Anthony Albanese is really having a bit of a PR issue here. He's been Deputy Prime Minister in the past, you've got to remember, he's not a totally unknown political figure. He has really worked in Canberrara for some time time but people still don't feel like they know him and he's really trying to push back on that assumption. Andrew McFarland, our wonderful Australian correspondent, thanks always so much for joining us and getting up this early as well. Go and enjoy the birds in the nice weather there in Australia.

What have you talking about roller skating as well? Although nobody has mentioned skateboarding. No. No, no. Nobody's mentioned skateboarding as we know, which I think this moves in nicely to where we're heading to now. it is the school holidays right and you know as a parent some of you could they might be driving you a bit nuts maybe possibly probably okay so let's bring in Abby Wakefield who may have something for us parents oh look at you shot Abby you got to stay humble you got to stay humble morning guys so good though when you go to the skate park and there's lots of boys there and you've got to freak out a little bit. So I'm actually joined by Tessa Hills who runs a community group in Tydafadi, Gisbin. Tessa, why talk to me about your community group? Yeah, so I started a skate kind of school thing in Gisbin with my sister called Shulley Skate and it's where we just encouraged lots of girls and like anyone really just to get together and come down the skate park and skate together because it can be quite and yeah like used to like an intimidating place and like getting together it just makes it a lot easier a lot more fun to get down there you just skate yeah and how's that going how many girls have you seen come through that um the numbers kind of fluctuate sometimes but I'd say like I've I've everything we've got around like around like 20 members and then they kind of just like come and go each week, but it's still fun. That's the, that's what I love about it, is like the freedom. There's no, it's just all up to you. You make your own rules. And do you think that's changing in terms of, you know, skateboarding being a guys thing? a girls giving it more of a go now? Yeah, I've definitely noticed like over the past few years and like running Shulis Gate there's been so many more girls and we're lucky enough to be able to hold a competition each year that we do and in Shulikin it's the biggest group of girls that you see down at comp so it's definitely like going up that year.

Thanks, Indira. Queenstown is experiencing a widespread power outage caused by a lightning strike. Aurora Energy says the outage could be affecting more than 1,000 customers, including the airport, the remarkable ski field and the Queenstown gondola, and could be out for a number of hours. The New Zealanders could see inflation hit 7% later today, higher than has been here for more than three decades. Salvation Army analyst Anna Iika says the rising cost of living is having a big impact on the lives of their fano. What we're seeing coming through our doors is that alfano have to make trade-offs, they have to make difficult decisions that they need to go without filling up the car or getting fruit and vegetables or being able to access food, food prices have increased by 7.6% and fruit and vegetable has increased by 18% and so that has real consequences for Alfano. Prime Minister Jacinda Arduin has touched down in Tokyo on the next leg of her first overseas trip since 2020. The Prime Minister will be in the Japanese capital for two days to discuss business, tourism and trade. The New Zealand delegation traveling with Ms Arden have completed compulsory COVID-saliva testing on arrival in Japan and are not allowed to leave their hotel rooms until the results come back. Evacuation corridors are operating in Maripol, allowing some civilians to flee the besieged Ukrainian city. More than 100,000 people remain trapped. Officials were hoping to evacuate 6,000, but say not that many have been able to leave. A Russian deadline for the last Ukrainian defenders in Maripol to surrender has passed with forces continuing to resist Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Zalenski has made another plea for military aid. It is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing for years. If they have the weapons Ukraine needs, if they have the ammunition we need, it is their moral duty to help protect freedom.

The All England Clubs Committee says it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian and Belarusian players. It means world number two Daniel Medvedev and women's world number four, Anya Sabalenka, plus former world number one, Victoria Azaranka, will miss the tournament. Officials also said if circumstances change materially between now and June, they would consider, reconsider rather rather their decision. Well Manchester City are on track to regain top spot in the English Premier League after a scoreless first half against Brighton. Riyadh Marez broke the deadlock for the sky blues and moments ago Phil Foden added his name to the score sheet. The city currently leading two nil midway through the second half and they will go one point clear of Liverpool if they hold on. which you'd imagine they would do. And finally a border collie and a quick-thinking teenager being hailed as heroes. The pair raised the alarm after a maintenance worker found himself trapped in a septic tank in Sydney. Channel 9's Emma Partridge has the story. Spot the dog was spot on the 10 month old border collie barking and running to the rescue. He was whimpering, whining, he started howling. Spot alerting 13 year old Kala after a worker fell backwards into a septic tank in her backyard at Terry Hills about midday and became trapped. We found him in the whole upside down with his legs in the air and yeah I called the paramedic straight away. Spot alerted his owner, the beautiful Kayla, who made the call to triple zero. She showed a lot of maturity. He was saying the waters rising slowly and that kind of freaked me out because I really wanted to make sure he was okay. While on the phone to triple zero Kayla and her mother fed a rope down the hole. The man in his 40s clung onto it until firefighters extracted him and paramedics treated him and paramedics treated him for minor injuries. He knew it was a dog he said without that dog he was wondering how he was going to get out so he was going to get out so he was pretty happy. I'm a lover of dogs anyway especially board of colleagues but yeah Spots pretty incredible and without him it could have been a much different story. He's a bit of a hero. He's definitely the hero here really loves people and he knows if something's wrong he'll go nuts about it. And the reward for this local lassie? Big dinner. Very big dinner. He's had many treats. Heck of a lot going on in this story wasn't there? Yeah, incredible though. Yeah, what are the chances and yeah lucky him. They were just going for a walk at the right time. Hanging upside down. I know guilets in the air. With the water rising. Not a good way to be is it? No. Far from ideal. No. no. Anyway, I think we should move on. Chang-Man. Probably why isn't it? Are you all right, Manny? Is it something cool, no, no, I'm good. No, no, I'm good. It's all good. Happy and good. Happy and everything. Everything worked out. to heavy rain in northern and western parts of the South Island. And watch is in place for Taranaki. Heavy rain expected to hit there later this evening. To the north, Muggy overnight for many of you here, thanks to that humid northerly flow. All of you can expect a few showers. They're gonna get heavy later, sorry. 23 degrees the high for Kaathaya and Auckland. a cloudy start of the day here. a few showers this morning. Again, those should really set in from the afternoon and evening, 22 degrees the high fourth Tarangya and Fakatane. And a fine day over on the East Coast, some northerlies, and you can expect the cloud to roll and later today in master and get into a high of 24 in Napi and Hastingsings. Oh, quite so nice through here, a bit of a gray day all-round showers, Tomarouhi, Lavinnui, Lavin and Wellington, and heavy rain expected later in Taranaki. That's shoot across the Cook Strait. Thunderstorms could be on the way for Nelson, through to the west coast. Rain, also possible in Blenemem and Kai Kala, and 23 degrees you're high. You've got rain at the start and end of the day for most of you through Waitaha Canterbury Christchurch though the morning showers should clear you're left with a partly cloudy day. Nice mild temperatures though 26 degrees and more rain for you through here that'll be heavy all day in Milford Sound. should clear for a time this morning for the rest of you 21 degrees the high for Danedin. Namakhi Kiyakui Chang, it is 23 minutes to 9. Let's take a little mental vacation to Auckland's Waike Island home to beautiful beaches, stunning scenery and a very special Wotap group chat. Yes, restaurants, bars and cafes on the island have banded together to combat pandemic pressures. To tell us more we're joined by the group chat founder and manager of Finise restaurant, Will Thompson. Morning, well how are things on the rock? How are you going? Yeah very good thank you. Yeah nice to be here. Yeah the rock's looking, it was a lot cloudy this morning but yeah blue skies. So yeah it's always beautiful over there. Hey Will tell us tell us about this check because this is your baby right and so as a business owner on Waihiki Island tell us about how this all started. Yeah so basically after the last pandemic the last omnichron wave when we when we came back to reopen we're obviously a lot of restaurants were hit with a lot of challenges so we just thought it would better to communicate better on the island so I've sort of known quite a lot of the owners and the managers on the island been here for sort of three and a half years and then yes I just decided to just contact them and just start creating a little group together so we could not only battle sort of the COVID-ish related issues but also opening times as well. So we felt it I just sort of felt it was quite important that we didn't all sort of shut on those Mondays and Tuesdays. We could also look at those Tuesdays and Wednesdays or Wednesdays and Thursdays or whatever it it might be to keep the island open sort of every day of the week. So what was the response from the business owners that you connected in with? Because I guess the other part of that too is the fact that you don't want all be open at the same time. Because there weren't people coming in the doors, right? Yeah, exactly. And if you're all sort of open on those, all open on the same days of the week, you do miss those days of the., actually, for us in particular for Finitcho, Monday nights now actually become a very busy part of our week. So we're shut Tuesday and Wednesdays, but everybody who's on board with the group is very positive. It's sort of evolved now from sort of just being opening times to now what we're. We're communicating whether the fairies are full or the restaurant is fully booked who can take this table of 10 and if your appliances go down for example as well we can post our contacts that we know on the islands that can go and help maybe new businesses or businesses with new management as well. That's a brilliant idea because I'm thinking about other smaller communities obviously you guys you know are on the rock on the island itself but there'll be a lot of communities, smaller communities around Al-Tairoa that would actually benefit from something like this. The communication between all businesses and it's not just about particularly in the times that we're in it's not just about competition actually it's about survival. Yeah definitely it's about being together I think the number one thing here is we'll be stronger in numbers so all the small businesses on the island is where you know even though the island's quite small we've got restaurants obviously an oni roa and onitangi in Ostland and Southdale and we've sort of got eyes sort of everywhere but the knowledge is is sort of key so anywhere in New Zealand can adopt this it's quite easy to do you just need someone to go around literally knocking on the doors of the businesses that are related to yours but then you can even open it up into maybe not just hospitality but into like retail and other businesses as well so you you sort of all as a community for the businesses you all sort of come together and can tackle whatever challenges that you may have. What about residents who live there on Waahiki Island? How have they responded to this? Because again, I think of different experiences of places where they've had to shut their cafes or restaurants. And so the locals themselves aren't being serviced, so to speak if they haven't had places to go on a Monday night when they'd really like to be out on a Monday night etc so how have locals responded? So I think it's been sort of a challenging inconsistent time is the way that I would like to put it is because what's happening for the locals is that everybody sort of at the beginning everybody was sort of chopping and changing the opening time so for them it was actually probably quite frustrating but for now we can see a little bit more consistency in light at the end of the tunnel that businesses now are sort of you know becoming a little bit more and stable as were. We can see, you know, overseas travellers coming over, but we want to, you obviously want to see more, but then also staffing as well, we want to see more staff come over and help the businesses and that will effectively help businesses say open for seven days for the community. And how is business at the moment we've gone into the orange seating of the traffic light setting, which means that, you know, we've got unlimited numbers, etc. So how are things on the rock? Yeah, yeah, so we just obviously had Easter and Easter was very positive, as in particular, from the feedback I got from the group as well, everybody seems to have a good Easter on the island. as in particular, we had one of our best, one of our best days on Easter Monday, well since I've been there anyway. So yeah, that's super positive. And yeah, we're coming into Anzac Day this weekend as well. So there's a little bit more of a buzz on the island. But yeah, just come over on the ferry and come and see what Waheke has to offer. Yeah, it's an absolutely beautiful place. The other thing I want to ask you about, Will, is around how you see this, the group that you have created a business, of local businesses on Waheke Island, that group chat that you've got going, can you see that having other potential, not just with what you're doing at the moment, in terms of coordinating times to open whether other businesses can take patrons if your restaurant is full. Is there any other ways that you believe that as a community you could use this way of communication? Yeah, no, I don't know definitely for sure. I think the the next sort of stage where we'll be sort of sitting down after the Agazack Bay period, but I think the biggest next sort of stage where we'll all be sort of sitting down after the Anzac Day period and but I think the biggest the biggest one would be sort of staff sharing and is is quite big so using it as a more of a sort of recruitment tool but there's very sort of touchy areas around there and the the other one would be an accommodation tool as well. So for us in particular on Waike accommodation is very very low. So people that are, we do need more staff, but there's going to be a housing problem there as well. So if people, if we can use this tool in the hospitality sector, say like, look, does anybody have a spare room or whatever it might be it can instantly go out to all the sort of venue owners and the managers and the do have a spare room they can put them up we do have Facebook groups on Waiji but if it's hospitality specific I think it would be get more of a more of a hit yeah that's absolutely brilliant well thank you so much for your time this one hey before you go for niche for niche for niche restaurant that's absolutely brilliant. Well, thank you so much for your time this morning. Hey before you go for niechae, for niechae restaurante. That's yeah, yeah, it's for each a yeah, not not for nieks. Sorry, mate.

So we do really good pizzas, pastas. Oh, do love a good pizza. getting over there and having a little bit of a toky tour around it's yeah it's easy to do if you're if you're living in Tamiki Makoto. Hey Will thank you so much really appreciate your time and it's bloody brilliant man this you know it's what started off as a simple idea has actually tuned into quite an amazing business tool so go you.

So yeah, so kids if you're watching at home, grab your skateboard, I've got a different one, I've learned how to do an Ollie, because the wonderful Tesser has been teaching me how to do one. So yeah, so kids, if you're watching at home, grab your skateboard, I've got a different one, because apparently my other one didn't have enough street cred. So Tesser is going to teach me how to do an Ollie, and we're going to teach me how to teach me how to do an Ollie and we're going to teach you through the magic of television. Okay, so, Tessa, first of all, what is an Ollie? So an Ollie is just like your first basic track on a skateboard where your feet are popping and it looks like this pretty much. So your back foot should be on the tail in the middle with your toes on the tail and then your front foot is going to be just behind the bolts here so just like that just yeah just behind the bolts and as you flip up or as you jump up your front foot is going to roll over and slide up the nose of the deck and yeah and as yeah basically like without the board it kind of just looks like that, something like that. So, like jumping off the back foot and doing all this. So can you show up for full movement? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I give it. No pressure, you're just on live TV, no pressure. Yeah, yeah, no, this is probably not going to be good, but... You got this Tesla. Oh, yaw!! Oh, look at there, did you see that, did you see that, That was so good. All right, now we're gonna give the rookie you go. And hey, kids, look, if you're a beginner like me, there's no shame in wearing your helmet, your elbow pants. No, no, that's right, Eddie. safety.

I forgot my mouthguard................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... you're going to hold me because this is fine. If you have a buddy this is really good because you lose your balance a little bit so um casey make sure you focus on the skateboard I don't want them to miss my cool trip. All right ready. Yeah, three two one. Yeah! That was actually good. Do we do one more one more? Do we get full air there? Yeah! yeah! I'm going to try it by myself. Yeah, you got that. Okay. And Tessa, you go around and do some actual tricks, and I'll just, I'll just stay here, and you guys can commentate. Yeah, we need to see the wheels coming off, off the ground. I'm not really sure what the qualifying our standards are, how it works when you're doing Ollie while you're skating. Yeah, I'll try it next to you. I'm not really sure what the qualifying our standards work for the world. Nice, nice, Abby! Nice recovery there, Amy. Here goes Tesser. Thanks, and there we go. Nice, Tesser. Well, yeah! It's really good. Hey Abby, what are the tricks? Well no, I've been giving him a little. I can probably try. Yeah, sorry, what was that?

Wow what about you? Chang men? one thing that I hadn't done for a while for a while which I probably do more of now is a bit of drawing actually. Really? Yeah like when I was at high school I used to do caricatures of my of my teachers and my mom would go to my mom would go to my mom would go to the parent teacher interviews and she would know all the teachers from all the caricatures. Really? And now obviously with kids you do lots of drawing and stuff so yeah that's something I've been getting back to. Did you did you ever show your caricature drawings to your teachers? At the Leavers Assembly I put them all on OHP's that's overhead projectors for kids out there and but put them all through so yeah love that you'll have to show us sometime do a like do a breakfast caricature a champion.
