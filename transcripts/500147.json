Protected by Parliament, the legendary dolphin Polaris Jack delighted thousands of travelers as he guided their ships past Polaris Sound to and from French Pass for nearly 30 years. In that time he gained a worldwide reputation, which lingered on long after his mysterious disappearance in 1916. From French Pass to the Hokieanga Harbor 40 years later, in the summer of 1956, where the few residents of the tiny seaside town of Opinoni took the protection of a new dolphin into their own hands. What's the way to Opanone? That was the question asked by curious sightseers from all over the North Island as they flock to the Hokieanga, drawn by reports of a tame dolphin called Opo, which every weekend drew hundreds of cars and buses and a traffic cop to Opanone Township. Crowds thronged the beach. Business boomed and overseas tourists changed their minds about mud pools and headed north to Opa Noni. Thousands came to see a friendly dolphin. Opo, classified as a bottle-nosed dolphin, initially thought to be male, was to see a friendly dolphin. Opo, classified as a bottle-nosed dolphin, initially thought to be male, was discovered at the end of a short life to be female. She was first noticed when she approached launches and dinghies. The beginnings of her friendship came when it was discovered she was playful. She liked a tickle under the chin or a scratch on the back. Growing bolder, she headed closer into shore. There a 12-year-old local girl, Jill Baker, took over the job of training. Opo appointed herself Jill's swimming coach, and Jill, in her turn, helped the dolphin overcome fear of human beings. From beginning to end, Opo kept Jill at the top of her list of popular humans, responding to Jill's every gesture like a household pet. With gentleness, Jill paved the way for a friendship between man and wild sea mammal that was in a few short weeks to become famous, as Opo Growing Tamer learned to play. patting and tickling the dolphins soon became a national pastime. Oppos' popularity grew as the news told New Zealand's best fish story in years, like the popular song written by Auckland composer Crombie Murdo. I'm opo the crazy dolphin, the kids think I'm mighty when I give them all a fishy bag right and a game of fall in the swishy tide I'm one fish that'll never get fried Unserved in battle for tea And I live at O'Panone by the sea Poo pooh, pooh, pooh, Everybody loves him at O'Panone Bay He's such fun for old and young, They all want him to stay. He's old for the crazy dolphin. He's friendly as can be. If you should want to learn to swim, you couldn't do better than learn from him. Very soon get you in trim. And he's giving instructions free down the good old open only by the sea. Some people just have all the luck I never thought I'd come out of a pup and see a bottle-nosed dolphin tossing a bottle H Opo's version of water polo through the crowds. Toss and dribble. Easy when you're a dolphin. Here, you have a go. Here, you have a go. Retired pensioner Frank Druitt was made Opo's official custodian. He kept an eye on the crowds, but only to see they weren't too rough. Opo liked the game of ball with friendly swimmers. Opo's specialty, a double fin-flip back-loop slam. Who's going to get the ball? The dolphin wins hands down. The human race just isn't in the race. Through all one warm summer, sunshine and laughter by the sea, Opo excelled herself in building up a repertoire of entertainment for those who came to watch and play. But these were to be her last days. Soon the sea was to claim back its own. Opo, the dolphin friend of thousands of New Zealanders, was to be found dead, stranded on rocks near Opanone, a friend for a summer, already like Polaris Jack, a legend."}
