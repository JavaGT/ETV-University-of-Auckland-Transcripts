RNS News at 6 o'clock, more in a call Anna Thomas Tanne. New Zealand and Japan are set to negotiate an agreement, which will see the country's share more classified information on international security issues. Both country's prime ministers, Jacinda Arderne and Fumio Kashida, met in Tokyo overnight. Speaking afterwards, Ms Arder noted the world was at a critical juncturecture and there is a need for more cooperation. This will support closer engagement in support of peace, stability and security in the Pacific and in the wider Indo-Pacific region. It's not yet clear what sort of material might be exchanged, but a spokesperson for the Prime Minister says it will not be intelligence. A family friend of Chaos Price who was shot dead by police on Saturday night says it's clear they did not need to kill him. The 22 year old was shot on Saturday night on State Highway 3 on the outskirts of New Plymouth after a run-in with officers. The police admitted yesterday Chaos Price was unarmed. Police say Mr Price was trying to hijack vehicles from members of the public after ramming a police car with his vehicle. Stacey O'Carroll, a family friend, was shocked. Police shot him when he did not have a weapon. He says the police had other options to stop him, including physically restraining him or using a taser. The United States is to send another billion dollars worth of military aid to Ukraine. The US President says the nature of the warfare on Ukraine's eastern front means different equipment is required. Joe Biden says the new aid, including heavy artillery weapons, ammunition and tactical drones, will be sent directly to what he called the front lines of freedom. He says the United States is also helping other countries to deliver assistance to Ukraine. On top of these direct contributions from the United States, we're facilitating the significant flow of weapons and systems to Ukraine from other allies and partners around the world. We won't always be able to advertise everything that our partners are doing to support Ukraine and fight for freedom, but to modernize Teddy Roosevelt's famous advice, sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large javelin. Joe Biden also called for humanitarian corridors to allow people to leave the steel works and other areas of the besieged city of Marjupo. The civil construction industry is calling for a big increase in worker training. A report by the Civil Workforce Forum and civil contractors New Zealand says infrastructure projects are booming and contracting companies cannot find enough skilled workers. Those projects include building roads, laying pipes and internet cables. The report calls for better entry-level courses to prepare newcomers to the industry and more links with schools. It says the civil construction sector is still developing the sort of training and apprenticeship systems common in other industries. The Ministry of Health is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees fighting families that care for their disabled children. The court cases revolve around whether the carers are employed by the ministry or by their disabled family members. Disability advocate Jane Kerrigan says three matters all which still have a long way to run through the court system have already cost the government more than six hundred thousand dollars. There's no will to change things it's just disgusting in this document this OIA just reinforces that happy to spend the money but just not on the people who warrant it. Why pay? Why pay care is when you could be paying lawyers? If the Ministry of Health is the employer it could mean compensation for lost wages and holiday pay. Towns north of Wellington that were once thoroughfare mean compensation for lost wages and holiday pay. Towns north of Wellington that were once thoroughfares for State Highway 1 are now quiet seaside settlements.

The co-owner of Greedy and Co- Coffeeove, Caravan, Sarah Kirkpatrick, says the reduction in traffic means that Pukurua Bay has become a destination. And in Pekariki, some residents say it's now much faster to get out onto the highway, and despite no heavy traffic, capp√©s and businesses in the village bustling. British MPs have agreed to set up an inquiry into whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. A panel of MPs will look at whether Mr Johnson's statements, in which he denied breaking the rules, amount to contempt of Parliament. He has rejected calls to step down. Boris Johnson was fined last week by the police for attending a birthday party in June 2020, making him the first serving British Prime Minister to receive a criminal sanction. To sport now, Blackferns halfback, Kendra Coxage is backing former All Blacks coach Wayne Smith as the Blackferns director of rugby. Smith will guide the Blackferns through this year's World Cup in New Zealand after former head coach Glenn More quit. Coxage says Smith's impact has been palpable. He came into camp two weeks ago and just a vibe in the in the group and that's really exciting as you know he's known as a professor and for me as an experienced power I'm just really eager to get what's up there out on the field and he's already kind of started and it's really starting for us. The blackferns mid-year fixtures are set to be confirmed in the next few days. The South and North Islands have split the opening games of their hockey series in Hamilton. The South women beat the North Toonil while the North men beat the South 3-2. The Black Caps bats batsman Devin Devin Conway has been named one of Winston's five cricketers of the year. Manchester United have named Ajax Amsterdam coach Eric Tenhag as their new manager from the end of the season and Cronulla beat Manley 34-22 and last night's NRL game in Sydney and that's the news. Country life this week's in the far north having a sip of home-grown coffee. This guy said, I've never been so excited to spend six times more than ever spent on coffee before.

It's 8 past 6. and you're listening to Morning Report on R&S National with Money Dunop and Corin Dan. We'll start on Ukraine, Joe Biden has announced the United States is to send another billion dollars worth of military aid to Ukraine. It will include heavy artillery weapons, ammunition and tactical drones which will be sent directly to the front lines of freedom. This package includes heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howards and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with those howitzers. It also includes more tactical drones. We're sharing and will continue to share significant timely intelligence with Ukraine to help defend them against Russian aggression. Joining us now from New York is our correspondent, Sarah Walton. Good morning. This is an important idea to acknowledgement again of the US's renewed commitment. Yep, absolutely. Joe Biden said, you know, he's announcing this package now because the fighting in Ukraine is at a critical juncture. He said that the support that the US had previously sent to Ukraine had helped them win the battle to keep hold of the capital Kiev Kiev and now that the fighting has shifted to the eastern region the Don Bass region he said this package is being tailored to specifically meet the needs there so as you say he is literally sending in the big guns heavy artillery shells tactical drones it's not all military though they're also sending 500 million dollars in economic support money which we used to pay people in the country and help rebuild, destroy homes and infrastructure, and intelligence as well. Joe Bine said that not all the support that they were going to give the country would be made public. He actually paraphrased a very famous quote from the former president of the US City Teddy Roosevelt, who once said of US foreign policy that you should speak softly and carry a big stick. Joe Biden at the White House today said that sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large javelin referring to a javelin missile. Yeah, I mean, how much difference will this make? 800 million, a billion dollars, New Zealand sounds like a lot but given the scale of this war, how long will that last? Well, I mean, it brings the total of military aid to Ukraine by the US up to 3.4 billion dollars. That's a big chunk of money. But it's an interesting move by the US. I mean, we've seen really since the start of the Russian invasion, a bit of a reticence from countries around the world, to get involved and give anything of the moral support really. I mean, even just in the last few days, Germany's been heavily criticised by Kiev for refusing to give them any heavy weaponry. Yeah, reticence has completely disappeared here. I mean, Joe Biden said that this military package is to help beat back Putin's savagery, and he's not hiding the intent of this. I think the US has really been emboldened by the success that Ukrainian forces have had so far in defending the country, which was not really expected at the beginning, and they're hoping that these large donations of military support from the US is what will be the turning point. In terms of Vladimir Putin what is the response likely to be from him he has started to make some comments I see in recent days of his frustration with that aid coming through. Well I think the US will be waiting to see what kind of response they do get from Russia. We have heard just recently if anything you know President Putin is doubling down on his invasion of Ukraine particularly in that eastern region of Donbas. You know the reticence of other countries to really get involved in the Ukraine is very much based on the fact that at the beginning of the war, President Putin said any intervention on behalf of foreign powers would be seen as a direct attack on Russia for which there would be retribution. But as time goes by, countries are becoming more emboldened, seeing that making a judgment that the Russian invasion doesn't appear to be going to a plan or the plan that President Putin had originally and gradually increasing their support for the Ukraine. Indeed, Sarah Walton, thank you very much. Our New York correspondent there with the latest on the aid coming out of the US to support the war in Ukraine. Now in other developments overnight, Vilemi Putin has ordered his troops, this is interesting, not to storm the Azov-style steel plant in Marupol where the last group, I think about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters, are holding out. Instead, President Putin has ordered his forces to seal it up so even, quote, a fly, cannot escape. It is 13 minutes past six. The civil construction industry is not training enough new workers to keep up with the boom in roading and infrastructure projects. A report by the Civil Workforce Forum and Civil Contractors New Zealand says finding skilled staff is the biggest problem for most contracting firms. It says existing courses and on-job training need to be ramped up urgently. He's our education correspondent John Gerritsen. The country has a massive pipeline of infrastructure projects, but the report says some parts of the industry need 30% more workers. One of its authors, John Bryant, says that's a problem because it's an aging workforce and contracting companies are already struggling to find enough skilled staff. They're all saying the shorter of skilled workers. Then the second problem is when a school lever leaves school, he still has anything from two to three or four years training required for them to be at that school level that the civil companies require that person to be at. The problem is that we haven't been training enough people to fill those roles. Another of the authors, Fraser May, says pressure is growing because councils and central government want contractors to do more work and faster. They want to get their work programmes filled and so they're asking contractors to basically out of capacity to meet that, whether that's some of the major projects or whether it's maintenance, water networks, roading networks, putting internet cables into the ground, everything like that. It all needs people and those people need skills to do the job. He says there are entry level courses funded by the Ministry for Social Development and other agencies but most people don't know about them. It would be much better if we had an entry point that people outside the industry could see so if someone wanted to join the industry say if you wanted to become an excavator or something along those lines you know they could say oh right that's where I go and be directed to go there. At the moment they can join a company and get those skills it'd be great to prepare them a little more before they started doing that. Philip Aldridge is chief executive of the Construction and Infrastructure Workforce Development Council, a new entity that sets standards and qualifications for the industry. He says training more workers is critical for the estimated $270 billion of construction and infrastructure work in the pipeline. The civil infrastructure sector is struggling for labour like a lot of other sectors. So that may or can result in delayed works, things slowing down and the overall bill programme not meeting expectations. So it's important that we actually make sure there's a clear pipeline of workers coming through, there's a clear pathways, and we meet all these big programmes that are coming up. Karen Gorkridge are from Konexis, the Industry Training Organization for Civil Construction, says part of the problem is that the sector didn't have a formal apprenticeship system until five years ago. She says that's meant employers haven't been getting the sort of support the new trainees that other industries have had for years, and few people understand the job opportunities in civil construction. Like all apprenticeship pathways you do start as a labourer. The difference with civil is that you can lead to so many different career opportunities that is often unseen. The pathway, the civil trades pathway, outside of the industry, there's little know and about it and that's because it is so new. So a lot of people don't see the opportunities. Kar and Gorkridge, as things are changing and the ITO now has more than 3,400 trainees nearly double the number before the pandemic. At 16 minutes past six, this year's Anzac Day dawn service at Auckland Museum will be an invitation only event thanks to the orange COVID protection setting. the general public are encouraged to commemorate in different ways across the day, instead of a will be an invitation only event thanks to the orange COVID protection setting. The general public are encouraged to commemorate in different ways across the day instead of attending the dawn service. David Burt is the council event manager and joins us now. Moreina David? More, Lenar. What is planned for the dawn service? Well, the dawn service, as you said in your introduction introduction is going to be different this year. When we were undertaking the Planning for Anzac Day across Auckland in conjunction with the RSA who's our partner we had to make some decisions because we were at red level. So the decision was made fundamentally to put the the veterans and their safety in Paramount. So the call was made to make it a service for the veterans organized by the veterans. So the Auckland RSA and the New Zealand and Vietnam Vets Association coordinating what's happening on the at the Senate off and the council is organizing the logistics. What numbers are you looking at? Well the the probably it will be in terms of the veterans and some official guests about 200 and we will have the the court of honor will be fenced off. There still will be space for the public that do want to attend but it will be a much reduced and shortened service. So instead if we won't have the usual big lighting towers or the the big screens so it'll be a smaller more somber occasion. However it is being broadcast by Mari TV and the public will be able to watch it live on their programming. So you said there is room for the public who want to attend because I understood that that you were discouraging people from attending the service, but there is room for people if they do want to to go Yes, we would prefer people Did watch on Mari TV and during the day we placed their own poppy tributes or wreaths at their local center tough, but if people do traditionally come along and not to attend, we will look after them, but we are expecting planning for a much more the crowd. Oh, cut off your time this morning, that is David Bert, who is how organizing the Anzac Day dawn service in Tamiki Makoto. It is 19 minutes past six. Let's go overseas again now. On Sunday France will decide who their next president will be. The centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron and far-right challenger, Maureen La Penn, faced off in a televised leaders debate. Now the fierce discussion lasted nearly three hours. The BBC's Jessica Parker has more. Sata desk's face-to-face two candidates. Bonsquare Maureen Le Penne. Bonsuir. Bonsuil√©m√©n√®me. Looking on two moderators against a studio backdrop of the Elise Palace with a trickle-or filter. These TV debates have been a fixture in the French presidential election since 1974. Marine La Penh who floundered against Emmanuel Macron five years ago, this time, had been preparing hard. First up for discussion, the cost of living. Macron five years ago, this time had been preparing hard. First up for discussion, you depend on Mr. Putin, you took a loan from a Russian bank. When it comes to Russia, you don't talk to other world leaders, you talk to your banker. He knows perfectly well that I'm a woman with absolutely and totally free and that I am a patriot because all my life I have defended France and all French people. So I'm watching the debate with a group of voters at a bar in France, Northern France, and millions across the country will also be tuning in. Both Macron and L√©p√©in will want to reach the disillusioned, the undecided, and shore up their supporter base. Through the next important and circumstance, the La Dieneschinal, through the nights they sparred over the environment, crime, the economy and France's place in the EU. Europe is not all or nothing. I want to stay in the European Union. I want to change it profoundly. Vontro Prog√©. Contingu-hmin. Your plan, when you piece it together, may not do this in name, but it would take us out of Europe. A fire exchange too over La Penn's plans to ban the Muslim headscarf in public places. We have to liberate back against Islamists. The principle of equality means that if you follow this logic Madame Le Pen, you will ban all religious symbols from public spaces and not only the Egypt. You're going to start a civil war. It's been a long evening, things are wrapping up here after nearly three hours. We're going to ask our panel how they did. I think she was not bad. Like, it was obviously better than in the 2017. I hate this man and I will absolutely vote against him. Before the debate I say that I was undecided, but even now I can't say if I'm going to vote for Macron or for Le Pen, but I think that this debate was really won by Marie N. But from domestic policies to how it would act in the world, these are two very different visions for France. Steering staff, the BBC's Jessica Park, there now, it will be Sunday that France will decide on that next president. It is 23 minutes past six. Some traffic updates and Tamiki Makoto Auckland, all lanes headed north are blocked on state highway one at the Johnstone's Hill Tunnel due to a crash. Motorist should expect long delays or consider detouring via Ottawa and Waibuda. Going down south to Canterbury, the left turn from state highway one onto Walnut Ave in Ashberton is also blocked due to a crash. Be careful out there. Korna Kauridorokhiri-hirimotyar-tiata, our main stories on morning report this morning, New Zealand and Japan, boost security ties. There's anger in Taranaki over admission by police chaos price was unarmed when he was shot dead and the US announces it's sending another billion dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine. Now at 24 minutes past six that is time to go to business with Jars Bifford. Good morning Jars. Kira to you, how are we looking out there? Is Netflix still rocking the tech stocks? I haven't checked it this morning but the markets on Wall Street they are a little Royals, they had some strong results at the beginning and that gave them a positive start but they turned negative bond yields on the rise again touching multi-year highs. There's a speech from the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that's got people on tenter hooks. Obviously investors worried about aggressive interest rate hikes later in the year. So the effect of that has been to see the Dow Jones industrial average full 0.4% it's about 150 points just sitting above 35,000 level. The S&P 500 is 0.9% lower and the NASDAQ is the one taking the hit and it's still feeling the over after flow of Netflix results is down 1.6% our own top 50 index back to losing ways but just a small one down 12 points just sitting below 12,000 and the New Zealand dollar took a bit of a tumble after the inflation numbers yesterday not being as bad as had been feared which seemed to dim just a little bit the most aggressive bets on rate rises in the future. So Kiwi at 67.3 US cents and 91.4 Australian. Your main bulletin today, what you got? Well we have a look at the aftermath of yesterday's inflation numbers and we're not afraid to mention the R word.

Kiyorada, thank you Jaws. sets your business update at 26 minutes past six. Time for the rural news with Sally Murphy in Ototho Thai. Sally and Sally Amari forestry group is urging the government not to remove exotic forests from the ETS. Tell us more. Kealarani that's right and a bit to achieve better outcomes from a forestation the government has suggested some changes to forestry under the emissions trading scheme. It wants to exclude any new plantings of exotic forests from the ETS essentially to slow down the sale of land for forestry conversions. Napur Atane, the National Maori Forestry Association, says the move would wipe seven billion dollars of possible future income from the Maori economy. Chairperson, Teakapunga Jews, says without the opportunity to plant exotics, most mauli land would be left near worthless. Mauli own 1.6 million hectares of land in the country, 80% of that land is on land use classification 6-8. The classification only goes up to 8 and 8 is the worst possible category. So the land that we've been left with, 80% of it is in the marginal, erodable, steep and remote type areas, and 50% of that land is considered underutilised. So it's not realising any economic value whatsoever. So this is not necessarily about even land use change. This is just simply about opportunity and availability of low contributing land being repurposed and reshaped into productive land that will earn us a net present value with $50,000 per annum. Tekapunga-ju says the consultation process has been rushed with no other options put forward. He thinks the government should take more time to look at the wider picture. Submissions on the proposed changes to the ETS closed today, the Ministry for Primary Industries will consider them before making a recommendation to the government, and any changes will likely come into place before next year. And Sally, a cheese company is making good progress, getting rid of 200 kilograms of excess blue cheese. I didn't think blue cheese went off. Yeah, well Craigie Range sheep dairy and hawks bay ended up with the oversupply this year because of cancelled hospitality events. Owner James Claremont says blue cheese has a shelf life of between five and six months before it gets too strong for most people. So they have some leeway in getting rid of the excess. When we went into our milking season which started in later August we were very optimistic that we were going to have a great summer so when we started producing cheese we went in with that notion. And so what have you been doing to try and get rid of the excess cheese? Well we've just done some local promotions and basically just making it available to buy it online at a reduced cost and going out to all our chefs locally and also offering it a reduced cost. So have you managed to get rid of any? Well I think we've probably moved close to a hundred kilo in the last two to three weeks. And James Cleomont says there's also been strong interest in cheese tastings which the company introduced to try and sell more of the blue cheese. He's hopeful they'll sell the remaining 100 kilos before it becomes too strong for people's palates. That sounds like so much a blue cheese. Are you a blue cheese? Fair? You, yeah, I think so. I don't know. I haven't had it in a very long time. No, I love it. Was too strong. That's the interesting. I think I'm fascinated. Anyway, like you say, I don't think it goes off, but yeah, it gets much stronger. All righty it's half past six you're listing to morning report on RN Z national your weather today now any rain or showers across the motto will clear later in the day and there's possible thunderstorms from 16, Dunedin 14, the warmest place at the moment is castle point on 20.7 degrees already and the coldest place is Queenstown on 6.5 degrees. All still making it in that 20 and wellie. Coming up before 7 on morning report Russia's president to house troops to try a different tactic to seize a steel plant in the port city of Marjupol. Russia threatened to overrun the sprawling plant or flatten it with air strikes but now the order from the top is to besiege it instead. There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities. Block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can escape. The bunkers beneath hold civilians and wounded soldiers. They've been told to lay down their weapons, but they fight on. And we speak to the Royal GP's network about the announcement of a new health pilot and Johnny Depp's testimony and his defamation so against ex-wife Amberhood enters its third day. But now the news worth Anna Thomas. Kiyoramani, New Zealand and Japan are boosting security ties in response to what Jusinda Adairn is calling a volatile global environment. The two countries are to negotiate an agreement to share more information on international security. It follows a meeting last night between the Prime Minister and Japan's Fumio Kashida in Tokyo. Ms Adairn says New Zealand and Japan are well aligned in their views and approaches to difficulties facing the Indo-Pacific region. The Prime Minister says both countries will work together to promote peace and stability and uphold the global rules-based order. And there is mounting concern over Beijing's growing influence in the region, although neither leader directly named China. Vladimir Putin has ordered the Russian military to seal off the Azov-styled industrial zone in Mariyupor, rather than storm the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in the city. A Ukrainian presidential advisor says Russia realised it wasn't able to seize the plant. And the BBC's port Adam says Russia needs the troops to fight elsewhere. Mariyupol has been holding up the conflict. It has been a thorn in their side. It has sucked in large numbers of Russian troops. It has exhausted them. And these are troops that Vladimir Putin would like to see embarking on other jobs to the north. Ukraine's government estimates 120,000 civilians are trapped in Marjupu. Meanwhile the United States has announced a further billion-dollar weapons package for Ukraine. A family friend of chaos price who was shot dead by police on Saturday night on the outskirts of New Plymouth says it's clear they did not need to kill him. The 22 year old was shot on Saturday night on State Highway 3 after a run-in with officers only yesterday afternoon to police admit he was unarmed. Police said Chaos Price was trying to hijack vehicles from members of the public after ramming a police car with his vehicle. Stacy O'Carroll a family friend was shocked, police shot him when he was unarmed. She says they could have used other methods such as a taser. Residents of a flood zone in Huanganoi have little hope the government will chip in to help buy their properties so they can move elsewhere. In 2015 floodwaters forced 250 people from their Anzac parade homes and climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of such weather events. A Massey University natural hazard planning expert told residents this week that moving is the only viable long-term solution. But resident Barbara gentlemen says that could only happen with government help. I'd like to see them come to the party but I think pigs might fly before that. It's estimated it would cost about 28 million dollars to buy out the 50 most flood-prone properties on Azac Parade. Recreating trenches and fortified par at Rangadiri in North Waikato is the start of a venture by local Iui to tell the story of the Battle of Rangadidi in 1863.

Kiyorra and a US Morning Report on Arranzian National with Corin Dan and Mani Dunlop. in this sports world with Tautato Kharipuatu Poro, Poeter, Pota Joe Joe and Wayne Smith has been named as the Blackferns new director of rugby. What do you reckon? More in Amani, well yeah it's a pretty good move on the Blackferns behalf or New York behalf to I guess Kainen try and salvage what has been a pretty big mess over the last few weeks which has been the Blackferns team the coaching and management saga and of course the review into the culture and environment of the Blackfoons which was fairly damning. So in terms of a mop-up job you couldn't really ask for anyone better than Wayne Smith he's a pretty educated well-respected rugby coach. He's sort of one of the brains behind the two all- World Cup triumphs in 2011 and he's known as the professor. He's a real strategist. He knows so much about the game. A lot of people have sort of talked about the all blacks and some of their I guess their decline since 2015 and the lack of domination and the lack of winning at the last World Cup and have put that down to Wayne Smith's lack of involvement with the team. So he is a bit of a diamond in amongst all the coaches in New Zealand. I've been a lot of people have tried to get him to coach their teams and he's chosen not to do it. So it is a good get for the black fence. There's got a pretty big job to do to resurrect that team with just five months ahead before the World Cup title defence.. defense. And there's also a pretty big lineup of assistant coaches. Who will join him? Yes. Yeah, so we've got Wes Clark who is the Hurricanes Poark coach from the CSU Brig. Apeke competition. He comes in as an assistant and Whitney Hansen who's the daughter of Sir Steve Hansen. She was involved first as an intern coach with the blackfern. She's been so impressive in the environment. She's been promoted to assistant coach and former all-backs coach to Graham Henry is coming in as an advisor as well. So it is a pretty stacked coaching lineup and it's good to have at least one woman involved within this Blackferns environment. Yeah, that's going to be a tricky one for Wayne Smith and his team to pull this off in such a short amount of time but I guess if anyone can do it Wayne Smith can. Is Whitney Hanson being placed there? Is that kind of what we're looking at a succession plan? Also I'm not too sure why we keep on saying that it's Steve Hansen's daughter she should stand in her own money Joe. I absolutely no it's just that I'm assuming listeners will hear that name and wonder about the connection and you're right she does stand in her own money she's been put in that place because she's been successful not because of who her father is she was it has been really impressive and Wayne Smith himself mentioned that all of the players have been impressed by what she's done she yes absolutely she is what the future of the Blackfields coaching unit should look like and hopefully after a successful tenure under the you know the auspices of Wayne Smith and and people like Sir Graham Henry and Henry and she'll get a chance to I guess take over a team and and put her own mark on it and shine in her own right and I think she'll probably need all the help she can get this time around to get things done across the line but certainly the future of women's rugby needs a coach like Whitney Hanson. Kura that is Joe Porter our rugby reporter. It is 19 minutes to 7 and Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops not to storm the Azov-style steel plant in Marupol where Ukrainian fighters are holding out. Instead President Putin has ordered his forces to seal it up. Dan Johnson BBC has from the the latest from the eastern city.

There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities. Block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can escape. The bunkers beneath hold civilians and wounded soldiers. They've been told to lay down their weapons, but they fight on. Yesterday there was some success in getting residents out of Mariopol to safety, but some convoys came under attack and tens of thousands are still trapped. Dimitri and Nadezda have just arrived in La Vive after escaping from Elitopol, west of Mariopol. Their Russian speaking, but couldn't live on their occupation. There was no shelling, but everything became very Russian. There was nothing Ukrainian left. They kidnapped priests and teachers, people from schools and universities, and forced people to make a petition to Russia and to promote Russia. On the journey, Day and their three boys came under attack and had to abandon their car. The youngest one didn't understand. He even loved during the shelling, but the older kids, they know that the walk can take their life. Others are making it west to safer places. This family with me, with four years old girl, with mother and grandmother, were missile, totally destroyed, the home. This charity has been running rescue missions to some of the worst hit areas. This is Harkiv Metro Station where thousands of families are sheltering and children are scared even to step outside. I don't know about their future, how they will live with this, how they will love each other. I don't know. They are very positive, but it's trauma for all their life and it's a tragedy of millions of Ukrainian children. The peace Dimitri and Nadezda thought they'd found doesn't last long. Another air raid warning and their eldest is nowhere to be seen. This is how the worry of war weighs heavily on parents. They find him, he's safe, all his well for now. But families are on edge across Ukraine, nervous and uncertain of what their future will bring. It is coming out to a quarter to seven. The Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has been cross-examined by the defense lawyers of his ex-wife Amber Hurd, her as being sued for defamation for implying her former husband, had abused her in a 2018 opinion piece for the Washington Post. In the article, Ms Hurd did not mention Mr Depp. Depp but described herself as a victim of domestic violence. Mr. Depp's testimony is now in its third day and he has accused Ms. Hurd of having violent outbursts and bullying him. Stephen Gator's the executive editor for Variety joins us now. Good morning, Stephen. Hello there. Now what are we to make of how this testimony has gone over the last couple of days? I guess a chance for Johnny Depp to have his say. Has he convinced people of his case, do you think? Personally, I don't think so. I'm not an attorney. I've heard legal experts saying that they thought she was being out lawyer that things were getting put on the record in this court case that her attorneys should have never allowed but you know I think it also changes from day to day and the most recent day of testimony with her attorney cross-examining him and putting on the record those really vile text messages that he sent I think to Paul Bettany. There's a lot of really damaging stuff here from Johnny Depp's own mouth. So not a legal expert but just a guy watching two people carry each other apart in court. I don't think he's scoring any points for himself from my point of view. Yeah, it's pretty heartbreaking to watch some of it, isn't it? Clearly just functional, a lot of drug use, alcohol. The text you mentioned, they're pretty extreme, aren't they, talking about let's drown her before we burn her. Is that right? Yes, and you make a good point there because the language isn't just language of dismissing his wife or ex-wife or not liking her or imputing her character it's extremely graphic violent acts that he's fantasizing performing on her and so you know if the idea is abuse that she said she was abused and you read these kinds of notes I think the average person says that sounds abusive. The he's argued that she was violent towards him and he's argued that she worked through vodka bottles at him and one of them severed his finger. What did you make of that testimony? You know, I think there's a value and I think that's what I was referring to that, you know, one of the servers said, you know, how did that get in there? You know, the idea that, well, she did this, so I did that's not really a defense you know it you if you actually are saying you know i was abusive but it was motivated you sort of throw the whole thing out i think her attorneys have done a very good job of making the point that jony depths problems in the movie business with companies like disney and getting cast in movies uh... preceded her op-ed piece that she wrote because he was doing a lot of things and doing a lot of interviews and getting a lot of really really rough press completely outside of Amber Heard she was not part of the really bad press he was getting about his behavior and excessive behavior and being out of control. Why is he doing this then? I mean we've heard that it's difficult to win these sorts of liable cases in the US. Is this Johnny Depp just trying to get a platform in a court of law to put his side of the story here? I think it's more simple than even that. I think it's if anyone's ever seen the movie War of the Roses, you know, the only people that win when couples decide to go to court are lawyers, generally speaking, you know, that just, this is a scorched-earth kind of case, he's never going to regain his image of who Johnny Deaf was prior to the Johnny Deaf of the last five or ten years. Is Amber heard part of that bad press? Yeah, absolutely. But he's claiming liable. First of all, we haven't even talked about how hard it is to win a liable case in America. You know, and he's trying to win a liable case. He's also gone after everybody in his life. He's gone after business managers and accountants and lawyers. Now her. It's not a very pretty picture of people at the top of the food chain in Hollywood, is it? It certainly isn't said stuff to watch in fact if you do catch that. Stephen Gaydos there, the executive editor, for Variety. Thank you very much for that update. Is it 11 minutes to 7? Yeah, I think that story raises a lot of issues, especially around domestic abuse, domestic violence and could be triggering for some listeners. Obviously, women's refuge, crisis, shine, shine hotline and it's not okay. We'll track them up on our website. It is 11 minutes or coming up to 10 minutes to 7. The government has named the first nine areas of the country that will pilot a key aspect of the major upcoming health reforms. The areas are Hauteuraki Thopu Waidua, Fanganui, West Coast, Eastern Bay of Plenti and Rufenua. Joining us now is the chair of the Rural General Practice Network, Dr. Fiona Bolden, Kiyorododododododododend. Well, first of all, we are really excited to see a good range of rural communities in the prototype development. There are some obvious areas which are missing, like Northland, for example, there is no prototype in Northland. And in the South Island, the only one is the West Coast, which is quite a different model to the rest of the South Island. And I think the issue with localities is that if they are going to be helpful at all or then really rural, you know they need to be helpful in rural, that's because this is the place where the rubbers really hit the road and healthcare is in crisis in many areas across the country. The rural general practice network have been very critical of this legislation. Do you still feel left in the wilderness as you've described it? I think so our criticism really is that rural is not recognized as a priority group in the Piora Health, Piora Bill, the Healthy Futures Bill, which is due to be, to go through Parliament on the 1st of July, in which all these changes are based upon. And what that means is if rural is not recognized recognized as a priority there will be no accountability for rural health outcomes which we've seen sliding backwards for the last few decades and which we see very little hope of significantly improving without actually some accountability for that. What's needed to happen? Are you at the table? Have you been calling to be at the table? Have you been calling to be at the table? Have you voiced this to the Minister's response being to your concerns here? I think that there's, well we've heard from the Minister, they issue is that if it's not actually within legislation, then we are still really dependent on the vagaries of government and how things change over time. We need something that's sustainable and future-proofed. And legislation future-proofs the conviction that rural health is in crisis and means that we will continue to measure those outcomes and fund rural health adequately so that rural people have as good a chance as anybody else to have good health outcomes. I'll cure for your time this morning. That is the chair of the Rural General Practice Network, Dr. Forenad Baldwin. Quick look at your morning newspapers. Almost everyone is leading with inflation. The New Zealand Herald has the low down on the latest numbers. And your inflation is of course now at its highest level since June 1990. And a lose-lose for labour is the headline on the Waikatal Times, which has some political analysis on the situation. The Don Post, also leading with politics and inflation, in the headline, Rising Costs, Shaping Politics. And in the press, a story on how Fano is shopping around to get bang for their back. And now for something completely different, their targets at times, Transport Minister Michael Wood is urging Wakaquataki to listen to de need and leaders before making the final call on how rolling around the city's new hospital can be configured. Some traffic, state highway 6, west coast, in Nahua to Westport is closed due to a slip, matter or should delay travel or use an alternative route. Seven minutes to seven. Jiles, back for time. Cura, Curin, thank you very much.atamariatato, in the bulletin this morning, inflation rate rises and recession, contact energy joins the solar power race and the latest from financial markets. Economic growth is likely to take a hit as a reserve bank look to tackle rampant inflation. Inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.9% numbers out yesterday which will guarantee more interest rate rises with another 50 basis point rise possibly on the cards next month. ASB bank chief economist Nick Tuffleyley says economic growth is expected to slow as a result of rate rises and employment growth easing. On the fears it might lead to a recession he says the central bank can pull back if it needs to. Gras is likely to be slow. I think the thing we need to bear a mind is that if it looks like the the economy going to be softening more than what the reserve bank's been expecting and more than what it needs to keep inflation under control then you will see interest rates drop as well. And we don't expect that the reserve bank will keep interest rates at a high level forever and at this point we're anticipating the reserve bank will start reducing interest rates in 2024. And the toughly says economic is expected to be flat in the first half of the year because of COVID disruptions and sharp increases in consumer prices, but the economy should pick up in the second half. Well, contact energy says power companies shouldn't let the future of the TY point smell to distract them from long-term investments in new renewable energy. Companies join forces with an international solar developer to develop a solar grid capable of powering 50,000 homes in the next four years. Future of the Smelter, which consumes about 13% of the country's power, remains in the balance. A cheap power deal that currently has ends in 2024, but it signal it wants to stay open beyond that date. Contact Chief Executive Executive Mike Fuge says uncertainty shouldn't delay necessary investments. I think the more important thing is the macro trend we see of increasing uptake of electricity as a fuel to replace fossil fuels and I think in the context of that macro trend it's important to keep an eye on things like TY, we obviously do, but it's also important not to be distracted by short-term issues like that, the expense of a long-term view of how we see this market developing the demand increasing next few decades. My view says it's on the lookout for land close to transmission points for the solar grid. Let's have a look at financial markets. Now Wall Street, the main indices, they opened higher, they were lifted by strong results from Tesla and Airlines, they'd since turned negative with bond yields hitting multi-year highs. Now a short time ago the chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell gave a speech in which he said that a 50 basis point rise is on the table at the Fed's next meeting obviously that unnerves investors and share prices so Dow Jones industrial average currently down three quarters of a percent more than 250 points gone below 35,000 the other main indices S&P 500 1. And the NASDAQ is 1.9% lower. Our top 50 index was down 12 points yesterday, about 0.1% just sitting below 12,000 level. The New Zealand dollar. It took a bit of a tumble yesterday after those inflation numbers. They weren't as bad as had been expecting and that's all some investors ratcheting back or pulling back on their bets for an aggressive rise in interest rates by the reserve bank. So kiwi at 67.3 US cents, 91.4 Australian, 51.7 British pence, 0.621 euro, 86.4 Japanese yen and 4.34 Yuan. Brinkwood oil currently up around 50 cents, 107 US dollars, 35 cents a barrel and gold is down 10 dollars at 1,947 US dollars an ounce. Another item of business use this morning quickly and using wind farms is one of its projects. We'll go before the government to see if it is eligible for fast track consenting. The company plans to repower the Terrero Win Farm in Palmerston North, replacing the 92 turbines with three blades, I think, and it will be much bigger turbines as well. The next steps of the company will be to consult with community affected parties and I hoping that they'll have an application ready later in the year. Back again around half past eight. Qayat-tot-kato-katoi, good morning, New Zealand, listening to Morning Report on Aranzev, Kukar and Antene. Kulmani, D'amopani Damoplini, Koutene, Koutene,u-tara, poripritporete perety-kitangaro, Friday, April the 22nd-kithangaroa, Friday, April the 22nd. Top stories this morning, Out there were in Japan, boost security ties. There's outrage in Taranaki after police reveal local man chaos price was unarmed when they shot him. And also on morning report, the US announces it's sending another billion dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine. Sport rugby coach Wayne Smith is charged with turning the black ferns results and culture around a head of the World Cup. In the air, t'an-hour showers across the Motiv will clear later in the day. Our N.S. News at 7 o'clock, Mayor Peter Boudpordidau, Corrana Thomas Tane. New Zealand and Japan are set to negotiate an agreement which will see the country's share more classified information on international security issues. The move to bolster security ties follows a prime ministerial meeting in Tokyo overnight. Deputy political editor Craig McCulloch is in Japan. Just Sinderadun and Fumiio Kishida emerged from their late night summit united, noting the world as at a critical juncture. They stressed the need to work together to promote peace and stability, as Russia wages war on Ukraine. China's recent agitating in the Indo-Pacific has also heightened tensions, though neither Prime Minister directly referenced the superpower in their remarks. It's not yet clear what sort of material might be exchanged as part of an information sharing arrangement, but a spokesperson for Jacindira Dern says it won't be intelligence. Two family friends of Chaos Price who were shot and killed by police near New Plymouth on Saturday say officers should have used other non-lethal options to subdue him. It's taken five days for the police to reveal the 22 year old was not armed. Jordan Bond reports. The police say Chaos Price had rammed a police vehicle with his car and then on foot tried to hijack other cars from members of the public. It was then that an officer shot him. One family friend, Stacey O'Karel, is shocked by what's happened and worries it will only deepen community mistrust of the police. He says there must have been other options, such as using a taser or physically overpowering the young man. Another Fano supporter, Tepati-, co-leader Debbie Nadi Wapaka, agrees saying the shooting doesn't seem justified. Joe Biden has announced the United States is to send another billion dollars worth of military aid to Ukraine. The President says the nature of the warfare on Ukraine's eastern front means different equipment is required. This package includes heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with those howitzers. It also includes more tactical drones. We're sharing and will continue to share significant timely intelligence with Ukraine to help defend them against Russian aggression. Joe Biden says the US will also ban any ships affiliated with Russia from using American ports, a request from Ukraine's president, which the US had previously resisted. And Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops to seal off Ukrainian defenders inside the besieged port city of Marjupu. The Russian president has told forces to abandon plans to storm the sprawling steelworks where Ukrainian soldiers and civilians are based. I consider the proposed storming of the industrial zone unnecessary. I order you to cancel it. This is a case where we must think especially about preserving the lives and and health of our soldiers and officers. There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities. Block off this industrial area so that even a fly cannot escape. in Putin as it would give us forces a land bridge to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula which Russia occupied in 2014. Ukraine says about 120,000 civilians remaining in Marjupo are being blocked from leaving. The civil construction industry is not training enough workers to keep up with the pipeline of roading and infrastructure projects. A report by the Civil Workforce Forum and civil contractors New Zealand says training needs to be ramped up urgently. Our education correspondent John Gerritsen reports. The report says civil construction doesn't have long-standing training systems common in other industries. That's because it's perceived wrongly as unskilled work and it didn't have a formal apprenticeship pathway until five years ago. Now contractors are struggling to struggling to That's because it's perceived wrongly as unskilled work and it didn't have a formal apprenticeship pathway until five years ago. Now contractors are struggling to find skilled workers and they need to train more. The report calls for a big increase in training including entry-level courses that prepare newcomers to the industry and better links with schools so companies can hire more school leavers. The Ministry of Health is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees fighting families that care for their disabled children. Independent Disability Advocate Jane Kerrigan says three matters all which still have a long way to run through the court system have already cost the government more than $600,000. The cases revolve around whether the carers are employed by the ministry or by their disabled family members. The employment court has twice found that the ministry is the employer, which could mean compensation for lost wages and holiday pay. Jane Kerrigan says the spending is wasteful. Flash flooding has forced evacuation at the Rekhiahat's settlement south of Christchurch last night. Police say they helped to evacuate at least three homes during heavy rainfall. A 100 year old man from the southern Brazilian city of Bruce has entered the Guinness World Record Book for working the longest in the same company, 84 years. Walter Orthman started on the working floor of a fabric maker, eventually becoming a sales manager. His advice for those looking for a long and fulfilling professional life is simple. Do what you love and stay away from junk food. Now to sport veteran Blackfern's halfback, Sandra Cox Edge is excited to work with new director of rugby Wayne Smith but says she had no issues with the former coach Glenn Moore. More quit as Blackfern's head coach on Saturday following a review into the team's culture with Smith now in charge of leading the team to this year's World Cup in New Zealand. I had no issues with the way that Glenn worked as an individual. He was successful with his time with the Blackfoons and I probably played some of my really good rugby underneath him. Coxage says some players have contacted more and they plan to do something for their former coach when the time is right. Meanwhile Wayne Smith concedes the Blackferns are in a race against time as they try and bridge the gap between them and other top international sides ahead of the World Cup in October and November. The Blackferns were soundly beaten in four tests against England and France at the end of last year and Smith has just over five months to prepare the team to defend their title. England and France who have been professional for quite a while, so you've got girls that have been training as professionals for three years, for example. So there's a bit of catching up to do... And the black caps batsman, Devin Conway, has been named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year. Ajax Amsterdam coach Eric Tenhag has been confirmed as Manchester United's new manager from the end of the season. Former tennis world number one, Serena Williams and seven times former one world champion Lewis Hamilton have joined a bid to buy the Chelsea Football Club and Cronulla beat Manly 3422 and last night's NRL game in Sydney. That's the news. Tomorrow morning Bill Browder has put his life on the line to combat Vladimir Putin. Jennifer Egan, author of the Pulitzer Prize winning a visit from the Goon squad, has a new book out, The Candy House, and we'll check out the Venice Biennalee, call Kim Hillahoe, join me tomorrow morning from 8 on Aranzid National.

It's nine past seven. Hatamariya, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. New Zealand is beefing up its security ties with Japan with a plan to share more information between the two nations. Jacinda Adairn sat down with Japan's Prime Minister Foymoy Kishahida in Tokyo last night, their first conversation since he was elected last year. Our Deputy Political Editor Craver Kolic reports. for it is this one. I sit down with the leader of the world's third largest economy, a power player in the Indo-Pacific, Japan and with China agitating in the region and Russia waging war in Ukraine. It could not come at a more critical time. Minister Konbonwa. Just Sandra Dern meet Fumio Kishida, elected in October last year, the Japanese Prime Minister has made a mark through his hardline stance on Russia. A stark shift from Japan's tepid response to the 2014 Crimean crisis. Nitti Niyuji land, Khodokshabiyo-toreokoloku-koumas. The two leaders emerged from their summit with impetus. The world they both say is at a crucial juncture. Side by side they again condemn the Russian invasion. The aggression Fumio Kashira says has shaken the very foundations of the international order. The second was Maroshian-Yuru Mahidono-Hijnayako-Shindyaku-O-R-S-A-Sindyaku-O-A-S-I-Sindyaku-S-S While neither leader mentions China directly, the superpower looms behind their words. Japan's tough stance on the Kremlin is rooted in the fear that any tolerance could embolden nearby Beijing. It's a concern New Zealand shares with news that China has signed a security deal with the Solomon's right in its backyard. It's time to strengthen ties with another powerful Asian country. China has signed a security deal with the Solomons right in its backyard. It's time to strengthen ties with another powerful Asian country. This partnership matters because Japan and New Zealand must cooperate in what is a deeply insertion global environment. That cooperation comes in many forms, but security is high on the list. Both countries have agreed to drum up a deal where more classified material can be shared seamlessly. New Zealand is committed to closer engagement with Japan on regional security challenges. It's not yet clear exactly what sort of classified material might be exchanged as part of the information sharing arrangement. But a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said it would not be intelligence gathered by spies. This will support closer engagement in support of peace, stability and security in the Pacific and in the wider Indo-Pacific region. New Zealand is looking for another form of security too, security in the way of trade. The recent tensions have focused minds on how heavily this country relies on China, its number one trading partner. It poses a serious risk of the relationship for whatever reason deteriorates. Another reason, Justinder-Arduin, is overseas, a bid to diversify into other markets. My visit to Japan on my first overseas tour since New Zealand closed its border in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a signal of the importance New Zealand places on reconnecting with Japan. One more day of reconnecting, then it's back home tomorrow. It's been a long break between overseas trips. This was one worth making. It is 13 minutes past 7. A family friend of Chaos Price shot dead by police says it's now clear they did not need to kill the unarmed young man. The 22-year-old was shot on Saturday night on State Highway 3 while trying to hijack vehicles from members of the public after first ramen police car. But it was only late yesterday afternoon that the police revealed Mr Price didn't have a gun. A family friend says there was no justification for shooting him. Jordan Bond reports. Stacey O'Carroll was known as Uncle Stace to Chaos Price. Mr O'Carroll says they were basically Fano. The 22 year old was good friends with his nephew. The police revelations about the shooting is a huge shock. Why such a drastic measure, like he's only a kid, you know, being unarmed, holy hell man, that's that's just wrong. You shouldn't be able to shoot someone who's unarmed. It's crazy man. I can't believe it. The police say officers were talking to a person they'd pulled over on the main highway when Chaos Price drove past without his headlights on. He turned around and driving at speed narrowly missed the stationary police car. He turned around and came back, this time ramming into it, again at speed. The police say he then got out of the car and attempted to commandeer a number of vehicles from members of the public who had stopped. He was shot while trying to get into one of these cars. The police say he did not have a firearm. Stacey O'Carroll says this description of events shows there were definitely other non-lethal options the officers could have tried. Well why not go after the guy and try and apprehend him? You know try and taser him or try to wrestle him to the ground or something? Debbie Nadiwabakat, the party mildly co-leader, is a far no friend of Mr Price's and has been in regular contact with them since. She says the communication from police has been a staged performance and they've been extremely slow in releasing in releasing critical information like the fact the young man was unarmed. She too thinks they had other options. Now it doesn't seem justified, but we don't know all the facts because it's taken them so long and they drip fit in the public. I certainly drip fit in the Fano because the Fano had been asking questions from day one and I would hope that as anything that they deserve respect to know exactly what happened to their son, to their grandson, to their brother. She thinks if police were wearing body cameras that would give a clear picture of what has happened. Absolutely, I think police should wear body cameras for one, for their protection for the public transparency and the use of dogs. and I think this is particularly in our community because it's just one too many incidents. Julia Faiputi, a trained lawyer and justice advocate, is acting as a liaison for the family. Really to manage the communication and the processes that are happening ahead of the police and they own investigation and for the Fano at at this moment in time who are grieving the loss of their loved one and I'll be meeting with the Fano over the next few days. Stacey O'Carroll is worried what this shooting might do to the relationship between the community and police. There's a lot of youngsters out there today that know this boy and you know to hear that he's being shot unarmed. You want to have respect for the cops but how can you have respect for cops when they're doing something like this? The police have declined to be interviewed they say they're talking to a significant number of witnesses and have forensically examined 15 vehicles and a trailer. Two senior police officers have come from outside Taranaki to lead the investigation. 16 minutes past seven, you're listening to a morning report on RNZ national overseas now. United States President Joe Biden has announced they will send another $1 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine. This package includes heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howards and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with those howitzers. It also includes more tactical drones. We're sharing and will continue to share significant timely intelligence with Ukraine to help defend them against Russian aggression. Mr. Biden says the aid package sends a clear message to Vladimir Putin that he will never succeed in occupying all of Ukraine. CNN's Iran Lieberman reports. So this, unlike the previous $800 million package, which is just a week or so ago now, is much more focused pretty much on one specific system, and that's more artillery, more 155 millimeter how it's hers. The exact number 72 in this package, that's on top of 18 in the previous package, and this is meant to equip Ukrainian battalions with artillery and the amount of fire that artillery for the upcoming fight in the Dunbass. The Dunbass region, it's flat, it's open, it is the type of warfare and the type of conflict that we expect to see here, which requires artillery tanks, and that's why this package is so important. and that's why this package is on important and that's why this focuses on making sure the Ukrainians have it and that they have it as quickly as possible. As the US watches, Russians either preparing the main attack or sort of carrying out probing attacks as they get ready for the main attack which the US expects here in the coming days. That's the CNN's orin Lieberman reporting there. Now the announcement of the additional billion dollars of arms being sent from the US comes a day after The missile which has been nicknamed Satan 2 in the West, would, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, make those who threaten Moscow, stop and think, with more on this new missile, were joined by senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Douglas Barry, good morning to you. This missile, what makes it, I I guess more worrying or different than others? It has an extraordinary large warhead capability, is that right? Yeah, I think what you've got to take into consideration in this program, sarmire as it gets cold, is it's been around for some time, the development programme stretches back back over a decade. It's part of a planned modernisation process that the Russians are undergoing for their strategic nuclear arsenal. That said, it's a very long-range weapon, it has a very large payload, and it's designed to try and defeat or counter any kind of missile defences that the US or anybody else might care to put in place. So just remind people what this missile can do. It's launched from Russia, is it, from the land and it could go all the way to the US, to the UK and send multiple warheads? Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, it, assumed to be a silo-based system. It's a very large weapon. It's probably the order of 200 tons. It carries at least 10 warheads, we would imagine, all independently targetable. So yes, you could, you know, it's ranges 10,000 kilometers plus, if not considerably more. Carries are pretty impressive payload of nuclear warheads. Probably also a number of penetration aids designed again as I mentioned to defeat missile defences. So a pretty capable system. That said, it's late. They've been trying to get to this point for over three years to get a first full blown test launching and the system that it's meant to replace is aging and actually should have been taken out of service by now. So the program is behind the curve and I'm sure they'll be very keen to push ahead with it now. Yeah, I see the US, US State Department down playing the threats. They were warned of the test weren't they as it happens with these sorts of things but nonetheless the timing of this with the war in Ukraine must be concerning. I think what it is is it's the timing placed to two audiences, it plays to the domestic audience in Russia, it's put in again his narrative as I am, at defending Russia, I'm a strong leader, and at the same time it signals to the West, you have to take me seriously and have these systems in development. Conversely, what again shows, however, is that the system itself is... you have to take me seriously, I have these systems in development. Conversely, what again shows, however, is that the system itself is late and is quite some way from being that ready to be deployed. I mean, this is the first of a series that is ready to go into service yet. That's interesting. So the US, which has some of the missiles, presumably is more advanced in terms of its technology and its missiles program, is that right? It kind of depends on which bits you want to talk about. I mean the Russians have a very capable inventory of ICBMs which you know over the years they've developed. These are aging. They're introducing new systems, Sarma being obviously the one that we're focused on at the moment. In terms of capabilities, given the payloads of these systems, it almost becomes kind of irrelevant, who's got the, if you like, the shiniest, most capable missile given the capabilities of the inventories that both sides hold. So it's mutual destruction still applying here, is it? You know, I think at the end of the day that's still what it boils down to you when you look at the US and Russian nuclear arsenals. Thank you very much. That is Douglas Barry there from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Just unbelievable that we're talking about nuclear weapons at the moment in this way, but that is the will we are in. Twenty-three minutes past seven. And just a little bit of traffic, a crash which was blocking Lane 1 citybound on State Highway 1 Harbour Bridge has been cleared but expect delays of course. Now the blackferns have an elaborate new coaching structure to help them defend the rugby World Cup title. Former all-backs coach Wayne Smith has been named director of rugby and will be assisted by Wesley Clark and Whitney Hansen. We'll be speaking to Wayne Smith later in the program. Sir Graham Henry will also join the team in a coaching support role while specialist coaches will be used throughout the year. So what does that mean for women's rugby with us as chairperson of women in rugby out there or Tracy? Hjopatina Tracy, no ma kitipu don't what? What are your thoughts on this appointment? I think that it's probably a smart stop get-stop get-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me- What this really says is that New Zealand rugby needs to step up in the world at rugby technicians, coaches and trainers and trainers. What this really says is that New Zealand rugby needs to step up in the interim, fund resource and support a comprehensive plan to support women's rugby from school girls to international and they need to do that before the end of the year. In terms of the report that came out that was skating that was leading more stepping down, these things go hand in hand in terms of the culture and also performance. Do you think this new coaching structure has what it takes in order for the Blackferns to defend their title? We've got five months to kick off money. It's a tall order and ask of any coaching and management team as well as the players. This team and coaching group staff will do as well as well as the players. This team and coaching group, staff will do as well as they can, they're up against it. The reality is that years of success of under-resourcing, under-investment, and lack of support for women's rugby is showing now and it's happening at the worst possible time for New Zealand rugby and the Blackfoons because we are hosting the world and the world is watching us. Social media has been interesting money in terms of acknowledging the high-powered coaching team as a band-aid for what's really going on in New Zealand rugby. In terms of that resourcing, but as well as succession plans for being able to appoint Wahine coaches in these positions, you know, the appointment of Whitney Hansen into that role, is there a succession plan in place? For, yeah. Is that what we need? That's what we need for coaches.. Right now, we've got Anna Rich, Davida White, Regina Sheek, Crystal Coa.. Rit's Devida White, Regina Sheik, Crystal Koa, we've got Victoria Grant, who's coaching and Vorto√≠di at the moment. We've got Wahene, who could step into the role now. NEDA has chosen to parachute in some exceptional coaches. Right now, we need to see NEDA taking the review report seriously and putting Wahene rugby a front and centre in terms of a real commitment in the next few months to come up with a plan. England's done it, Marney, France has done it as well and we now need to see Al-Tiarawa steeper. Do you trust that they will? I've got my money on them doing so because right now the world's watching their behavior. We've just had new directors come in, I'm hoping that all three vacancies of women, that they will need to work with organisations like Women and Rugby Out here or and others in order to show they mean business. And of course my phone is always on. That is a great deal. That is a cheap person of women in Rugby, Ottawa, Tracy Ho-Papa. Twenty-seven minutes past seven towns north of Wellington that were once thoroughfears for state highway one are now quiet seaside settlements. It's been just over three weeks since transmission galley opened, diverting traffic away from Pukkurua Bay and Pakariki. Business owners and residents are thrilled their towns. have now become destinations instead of stops along the way. Rosie Gordon reports. Rumbling trucks and traffic jams used to be the soundtrack to life in Pekakariki. Now standing at the shops the traffic noise is almost gone. Alarm bells from the train track and chatter from the local cafes are some of the loudest sounds you'll hear. Three or four hours of days come through here. Sirens all the time. Well go on now, you're lucky to hear it now, let's go through the main street, traffic, nice and quiet people living next to the main road, nice and quiet for them now. Vernon Lancaster has lived here all his life, getting out of Pikaikaraoke used to mean navigating a busy intersection with State Highway 1. Now you pull on to a much quieter State Highway 59. You can wait five minutes to get out of Pika. Yeah, bang. You think it? Spenya Donlon says it's much safer too. turning out of the road here, I mean I have a toddler but I keep thinking when he's learning to drive it's going to be so much easier getting on to the main road here so yeah. She says the town is bustling even without the hundreds of cars that once drove past. So far the village is still pretty busy, cafe stuff, operating and have lots of people there. We've also known a small bike so we're the people making it a destination because the road's not here. I'm not sure yeah, we're enjoying it. Pika Kariki was a destination for Jazz Ashby on her way home from a holiday on the Kapari Coast. We're just on our way back to Wellington and thought we'd pull off and start here. I think business will be affected because you're not naturally just pulling off and driving and having a coffee here. You've got to make a choice to do that. Fisherman's table sits on the old State Highway and looks out to see. owner Muri Sio Toreelba says the business has been impacted, but for the better. We've doubled the sale straight away. It just tells us that the transmission galley effect is not going to do us any kind. other way around. Fridays used to be a nightmare to get through here. Now it's all nice and easy to get through. The Old State Highway 1 road runs through the settlement of Pukura Bay, splitting the town in half. Co-owner of Greedy and Co- Coffee Caravan, Sarah Kirkpatrick, says the reduction in traffic's having a positive impact on both her business and the community. People on the other side of Pukura Bay are coming over more because there's not that. You know, because it used to be very hazardous to try and pull out on the main road. The community's kind of coming together more I think, because it has been kind of that side and then this side of Popperra Bay. She says Poockaua Bay is becoming more of a destination, a destination, a destination where resident Courtney Young feels more comfortable raising her kids. My little girl she turns five next week and she's starting at the school. She had just been able to like walk to school without having the heavy traffic on the road will be much safer. Meanwhile transmission gully's been busy with an increase of nearly 200 vehicles per hour last Thursday between 7am and 3pm as people headed north for Easter. Ventia, which looks after the road, can't predict how busy and that weekend will be. It is half past a, Thinefayakine, coming up before 8. on morning report, building costs are being singled out as a major contributor to the country's record inflation. The Ministry of Health is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars by taking families that carefully disabled children to court, and it's Asak Day on Monday. And while many formal events have been canceled, we'll find out how you can still keep the Anzac spirit alive before eight. But now it is the headlines with Anna Thomas. Kiyoramani. Kiyoramani, the Prime Minister says Japan and New Zealand will work together to promote peace and stability and uphold their global rules-based order. The two countries are boosting security ties in response to what Jacinda Rondon is calling a volatile global environment. The two countries set a negotiating agreement to share more information on international security. It follows a meeting last night between the Prime Minister and Japan's Fumio Kashida in Tokyo. Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops to seal off Ukrainian defenders inside the besieged port city of Marupol. The Russian president has told forces to abandon plans to storm these sprawling steelworks where Ukrainian soldiers and civilians are based. He's instead congratulated his troops on what he calls liberating the devastated city. Analysts believe it shows Russia needs the troops otherwise tied down in Marjupol to support its wider offensive in eastern Ukraine. An economist says eyes will be on the government to see if it extends fuel tax cuts, which helped to dampen inflation. inflation hit 6.9% yesterday, the biggest rise since mid-90. Intermetrics principle, economist Brad Olson says government intervention into fuel prices helped to keep inflation lower. But Mr. Olson told, first up, inflation will go higher, so the government needs to figure out if fuel tax cuts, which is due to expire in June, should continue. A family friend of Chaos Price, who was shot dead by police on Saturday night on the outskirts of New Plymouth, says it's clear they did not need to kill him. The unarmed 22-year-old was shot on Saturday night on State Highway 3 after running with officers. Police said Chaos Price was trying to hijack vehicles from members of the public after ramming a police car. And flash flooding forced evacuations at the Rakaya Hutt settlement south of Christchurch last night. Police say they helped to evacuate at least three households during heavy rain around 10 o'clock. A spokesperson says water receded a short time after that. Now let's look at the weather around the regions. Kaitaya, rain easing this afternoon 22, Fangare rain, rain, rain and possibly thunderstorms clearing this afternoon.

Now, some feedback coming in, we would discussing earlier, Russia's testing of a new intercontinental ballistic missile which can fire nuclear warheads. I made the comments that it was unbelievable that we were talking about nuclear issues. sure has taken a little bit of issue with that. He said, you genietics, and I Sean has taken a little bit of issue with that. He said, you genex is and I am genex, I'll be honest, and millennials need to wake up and smell the cheese. The threat of world or nuclear war never left us. We just choose to be willfully blind focusing on your avocado toast and reality TV instead. That's about harsh. He's not wrong. Well I would say as a genex, sir. nuclear war was very much to the forefront of my childhood and I'm sure many would agree it was a big part of the cultural landscape and he's right though, it hasn't gone away. Thank you for your feedback. always welcome to 101 on the text. It is 25 minutes to 8. Let's get record inflation. Construction costs made up a big part of housing inflation, which rising a whopping 2.4% in the three months, ended March. Joining us to discuss the building outlook is the chairperson of the Enz certified builders Ian Chamberlain. Good morning to you, Ian. Well it won't come as anyone surprised anyone trying to build a house that costs are soaring in the building industry. Is there any sign of it easing? It doesn't appear to be any let up on sustainable demand for the housing that we've seen throughout the last four years. It's an appointment part, probably part of the industry need to make sure people are properly trained to ensure that they build an activity continues at a high level and high standards. This is very important that we hold up, make sure that the people are formally qualified for our association to be... Well, that is interesting. Let me just pick you up on that, because I wonder whether there will be pressure to cut red tape, to cut regulations, to try and, I guess, reduce costs as this goes on. Yeah, we always like to see that red tape got rid of, but one thing we've got to make sure that we've still got a good sustainable industry and that we're doing good standards and there's a good check done to make sure that everything stays well and going forward. Because what else can we do? What else can we do as a country? I mean I know there is a commerce commission and a look at the supply issue of building supplies and the competition there. That'll take time though. What could we do in the short term to reduce building costs? I don't think there's ever always going to be a short term solution. I mean the key for us going forward at the moment is still making sure that we've got good pipeline of apprentices coming through because one of the situations we're in at the moment is because we've gone through pits and trough and troughs and when we've got good pipeline of apprentices coming through because one of the situations we're in at the moment is because we've gone through pizza and troughs and when we go through a trough we end up not training enough people. And for example sake at the moment later this year the apprentice booth scheme and fee-free will be terminated and as New Zealand certified builders we would like to see those these extended so that we're making sure that we've got qualified people in the industry. This is one of the reasons why we've got skill shortages at the moment and why we end up with this whole supply and demand and put costs up. Well maybe it's just that the reserve bank has to get on to do its job, reduce demand in the economy that will bring, we'll see how prices come down as interest rates go up. You will see a slowdown in demand in the building industry and that's maybe what's needed is it? I don't think we're going to see a massive slowdown. I think because you have to remember that we're probably overcompassitized at the moment, I think you will see a slowdown slightly, but that's all good in the long run. I think the biggest issue is going to be people trying to get onto the housing ladder and for the affordable housing because obviously land costs and there are certain red tape going around some of those things which do actually slow up and do actually pushing it. Right. What about property developers and even first, well people who want to build their first home or whatever a build-a-home, might they think about delaying it though if interest rates are higher that they push that out? I think you will see some of that and I think some of that will be more around that people actually able to get the finance in the first place because obviously the banks criteria has changed quite a bit. The other thing we need to look at as well is we need to make sure that we're looking at smaller properties. A lot of people seem to want a big-sized property well it's actually more sustainable and people to get on the property ladder is if we're actually looking at a smaller property sizes and some of that is down to the supply of the land actually doesn't allow some of those smaller properties to be built at the moment which pushes the costs up. Just finally on the issue of the the competition which I think the Commerce Commission is having a look at but you know we've seen investigations with petrol supermarkets not huge change coming from that yet I mean how optimistic are you that there could be some sort of reform of the competition that would bring prices down? I think you're still going to struggle with that. You have to remember the size of the country. We, they often, the government goes on about, you know, you can buy products a lot cheaper in Australia, but they often compare us with cities where some cities in Australia may produce the same amount of new houses that we produce across the whole country within at the same time and obviously when you put logistics on that it always we're always going to end up paying more costs for our materials because it's the sheer number that we're actually doing and then put a logistic costs in that as well. I mean gibb board's been the big one isn't it. You see any hope of things like gibb get the sheer number that we're actually doing and then put a logistic cost in that as well. I mean, Jibboard's been the big one, isn't it? I mean, do you see any hope of things like Jib getting cheaper? I mean, if we're importing any alternatives, that doesn't look good either. Does it, given the shipping earthquake and the situation that we were in. I think a lot of our manufacturers do do a really good job within our country but it's just down down to that demand and then those whole logistic costs. I've not really seen the time I've been here and the cost reduce. The only thing that can be normally often be reduced is land costs. seen the time I've been here and the cost reduced. The only thing that can be normally often be reduced is land costs. Indeed thank you very much for that. Ian Chamberlain there, NZ certified builders, those building costs still causing major problems with inflation at the moment, 19 minutes to 8. Many ANZAC Day formal parades and services have been cancelled due to the Omicon outbreak and this year's dawn service at Auckland Museum will be an invitation only event. RSA President B.J. Clark says New Zealanders can still make an effort to keep the Amzak spirit alive. He joins us now. Could a B.J. always a busy time of year for you? Qiyoramara, yes it certainly is. There'll be lots what what's happening still on Saturday this year. Yeah tell us what is going on. What's happening now firstly at the Auckland Museum? Dawn Service. Okay so the Auckland Museum that are still carrying on the service will be a area for the veterans alone that's just to protect our veterans but the public will be able to attend that service on the after of the where the veterans will be. Any matches happening? To my knowledge very few, and the reason for that is because initially we thought that services will be curtailed, it's been very difficult to work out traffic management plans at a last minute notice notice so there will be very few marches themselves happening. Now a lot of the planning obviously happened in red light so like you say no you can no last minute changes essentially for it to be under orange but in terms of people wanting to celebrate or sorry commemorate Ah Zek day on Monday what are you encouraging people to do? I'm encouraging people to check in their local areas, check in their local RFAs to find out if there is a service in the area and if there isn't or it's difficult for people to get to then there's still a standard dawn scenario that we have used previously that they can tune in at 6 o'clock and here the last post etc. The owed on radio. But also around the country there are a lot of cenotaphs that don't actually see or not a visit. And so it would be wonderful if people would just go down the road to the local cenotaph and lay a poppy on there. I mean, you know, it would be I think just, you know, quite an amazing emotional event to do that. Yes, definitely got my popper yesterday. I've been seeing them all around the city, so yeah, get your poppies on fun. That is B.J. Clark, USA. President, and I'll be hosting the Anzak Day service from Pughahoe Park on Monday. Nice one. 16 minutes to 8. The Ministry of Health is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees and it's battle to ensure families that care for their disabled children aren't paid more. Three cases, all of which still have a long way to run through the court system, have so far cost the government more than $600,000. They all revolve around whether the care is are employed by the ministry or by their disabled family members. Now the employment court has already found that the ministry is the employer which could mean compensation for lost wages and holiday pay. Jane Kerrigan is an independent disability advocate and joins us. Now good morning Jane. Morning, how are you? You, your reaction in hearing that they've spent over half a million dollars so far on this process. Well that is a snapshot current. If you add it to the money they spent on two matters they settled you've got just shy of a million and then if you add the three matters that they've gone to the Court of Appeal in and consistently been ignored by the Ministry of Health, you're talking about millions of dollars. So the 600, frankly, the fairly lazy snapshot, that covers three lawyers. Bear in mind on the first day that Christine Fleming's matter opened and ran for seven days. There were 12 lawyers sitting in front of the judge. So we are talking millions of dollars. In addition to the lawyers you have, you know, some of the Ministry of in front of the judge. So we are talking millions of dollars. In addition to the lawyers you have, you know, some of the Ministry of Health, elite, senior bureaucrats, seven of them again, sitting in Ms Flynn's matter. So, you know, the money is just, money is no object when it comes to them, to government, trying to avoid its obligation. Well, yes, is this is going to end up in the Supreme Court is it of that level? It's hard to see how it can't but having said that the Ministry of Health and the Crown have a very sneaky habit of losing in the Court of Appeal not appealing it to the Supreme Court and then just going on ahead and ignoring what the Court of Appeal said. So yeah time will tell in terms of where it ends up but it absolutely should end up in the Supreme Court because we now have a lost generation of disabled kids and their families to our current disability support system. A system, I note, is not going to change for these people under the new Ministry of Disability. It doesn't matter what you call it. Help me idea. Why is the government so resistant? what are we 30 years later it's still one point eight years later it's it's simply that the the cost that they will incur from how much would that be give us a sense do you think okay I'll give you a sense in 1992 the disability budget was one billion dollars and index adjusted it was 1.8 billion and what are we 30 years later it's still 1.8 billion dollars we have 1.5 million more people in the country once upon a time the crown recognized the very high level of work that's required working with these people it's not just disabled people it's also elderly living in their homes my father's 94 and you can't get into a riskier home because apparently he's too independent I mean mean really the need to assessment right across the board for anyone who needs support living in the community is just fundamentally grossly rolled. So you're saying that they need to spend billions more? Well, let's put it this way, the crown has saved billions off the back of exploiting parents. It's very ironic that our current government is bringing in a modern slavery legislation when when you sit down and you read the definition of what slavery is then I can tell you he'll be the first person the first entity to have a case taken against it and that will be the crown. Because these people are providing 24-7 support care that once a per time we pay big money to hospitals, to train nurses and to train doctors in. Now its parents are expected to provide and family members to provide a superior level of care for these people. Many of them have multiple problems. They're not just sweet, you know, intellectually disabled people who are fun to take out because they're cheerful and nice to everyone. That's not the case. And so, yes, they have saved billions, so now they have to turn around and spend billions. And when we talk about poverty at Northam, Corrin, stop paying families who get 350 under the minister of social development to provide care 24 7. This is the requirement you have to be providing care 24 hours and keeping your family member out of a residential care or a hospital system. They get $350 a week for that. Tough stuff. Jane, thank you very much for that. Really appreciate it. Jane Kerrigan there their independent disability advocates, it is 11 minutes to 8. In the Expert in Natural Hazard Planning, says the government needs to buy out residents in flood-prone areas, such as Anzac Parade in Wanganui, all risk people losing their lives. In 2015, flood waters forced 250 people in the city to be evacuated from their homes and climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of such weather events. on flood planning. He's been facilitating flood resilience workshops with Anzac Parade residents and he's had little good news to share with them. The long story short in this particular case is this river is going to flood again it's going to flood seriously. It's likely to increase in, those floods are likely to increase in magnitude and possibly even frequency in coming decades and so the risk is not going to go away. Dr. Gavovich looked at raising stop banks and lifting houses on Anzac Parade, both of which were technically challenging and expensive. Raising stop banks to protect for a one and two hundred year flood cost about thirty million dollars, while lifting a typical home cost between three hundred,000 and $500,000. Dr. Glavovich says the short-term focus should be on efficient evacuation. The first thing that has to happen is that we need a really effective warning system that gets to everybody so they can make wise decisions and evacuate if necessary. My worry is that failing to do that will lead to loss of life, sooner or later. He says in the long term, a buyout of the 50 most flood-prone houses is necessary. Estimated to cost about $28 million. Dr. Glavovich says that would require government help. Government needs to step in the case where there are communities that are in harm's way where there is a serious risk of loss of life and where people are unable to choose alternatives. He says a process for the equitable sharing of the costs with vulnerable communities is required. Flood Waters reached head height in Kiesa Coles' Anzac Parade Home in 2015. She'd hoped for more from the planning workshops. It's just the same. No solution really, but at least they're trying so. What were you hoping for? A solution. Any solution? Something? She welcomes the focus on the early warning system. We were told to 10 o'clock at night, forcefully, to get out of the house. So I don't know where the break-up is in that department because in town the cafe down the bottom of town. They said they were warned at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. Barbara Jaliman was supporting her father, Trevor. He doesn't think a solution will come in time for him. What will I do? I'll probably be six foot under. Nothing like it. Barbara says the government should pitch in for the buyout option. I'd like to see them come to the party, but I think Picks might fly before that. Sorry. Brian Rhodes is on the same page. It would appear that the government's got to make a decree, because there's people won't move. A lot of people won't move there. Unless the government makes it mandatory and funds it to a certain extent, I don't think you're going to get a real solution. The Massey University team will share its findings with the wider Honganoi community at a public meeting next month. It will then make recommendations to the regional and district council. It is eight minutes to eight and three scenic tracks in the Wainui or Tertiwah, Auckland's Maitakiri Ranges, will reopen today after being closed for four years to protect precious kodi trees from disease. Open again after an upgrade costing two million dollars, Artha Gibbons, Muir and Paradaha Valley Tracks and joining us now is Auckland Council's Environmental and Services Manager Rachel Kalaher Kilda, Rachel Nomayiki Thapuroor. Now how much did that four year we have an impact on Cody dieback? Of course that's a really great question and it's something that we are going to be monitoring over time. The nature of Cody Diabek disease is one that means that we can't actually measure change in sort of weeks, days, months but it's more of a change over time. We have a comprehensive monitoring program that will be answering that very question. And these upgrades to the tracks, what's actually been upgraded? Today we're really happy to be reopening as you said the Gibbons Muir and Paraaraha tracks and what's particularly significant about that is that it's going to be connecting with other tracks that we opened last year and re-establishing an overnight long walk-tramping opportunity that's been missing from the ranges since 2018 and as part of that iconic Toyota to the Herlouh trail opportunity. Yeah these are some beautiful tracks which I've done a couple of this is in Fatsipuya. Yes that's right. Just tell our listeners where exactly that is in terms of the peninsula. So the reopening of these tracks today will create an opportunity where people can walk from hooia at the southern end of the White Tarkeri ranges right around the headlands through to Anafota and we're currently now working on the next stage of the track reopening program which will see that Anafhata Tajenga section opened later this year. And what has Tekoroamaki the Manafinua, what's there all being? We've worked really closely with Takoro Markey right from the beginning of the Wendarahu was put in place through the last four years as we've been working on the track reopening program. You know, we've worked with them on the design, the methodology, making sure that we're actually recognizing and protecting the significant cultural values of the area. It's really been a true partnership and we are incredibly grateful for their support in this work that we're doing. Kura for your time today I'm sure that's an awesome thing for people to do on a long weekend. That is Rachel Kalaher. Walking Council's Environmental and Services Manager. Yeah beautiful part of the world. Let's talk rugby. Super rugby. Yes, the competition becomes truly Pacific this weekend with the New Zealand teams heading to Australia as the championship reaches its halfway point. The five Kiwisides will face their Australian and Fijian counterparts in what's being dubbed a super round in Melbourne. Unfortunately, Moana Pacifica will have to wait to get some non-New Zealand competition with their game against the Western Force being postponed due to a COVID outbreak in the Perth-based side. Boy, they haven't had much luck, Moana Pacifica. Now our rugby reporter Joe Porter takes a look at whether the matches will be any closer than last year. The lower one is, after 18 years, the Blues have a trophy to put in the cabinet. The Blues beat the Highlanders in last year's Super Rugby Trans-Tasmine final to end in almost 20-year titled drought in what was a competition dominated by the New Zealand sides. The five teams from Al-Teroa finished first to fifth fifth with the five Australian teams winning just two games between them. So will the Australians win more matches this year? Rugby pass analyst Ben Smith expects they'll be on the losing side more often than not. The ones are going to be few and far between for the all these sides I think. Looking at their game, it's not at the same game speed as what the Kiwisides play so the all these sides will struggle to keep up. The bookies have The Crusaders and Blues' favourites for the Crown, ahead of the Chiefs, Hurricanes and last year's Australian champions, the Queensland Reds. Hurricanes wing and former all-black Julian Savires as the Australian teams will be out to make a point. First time playing the Ozzy teams, they've got a chip on their shoulder because, you know, where the media says, you know, they're not better than us. The hurricanes take on Queensland tomorrow night with the reds sitting knows the value of a win this weekend. Getting into the Kiwis, which is being inside about a year, I guess it's a different brand of rugby. We're going to be playing to a lot more upbeat, more tempo. We've got to be on our toes. It'd be good to get one over the Kiwis to start off, get a bit of a kickstarta. but coach Scott Robertson says it's hard to judge how good their trans tasmine rivals will be. It's probably looking at actually just feel like you've just seen the reds play the the tars again or it's just over and over it's and true you actually get out on the field you don't really get a true feeling. Ruggby pass analyst Ben Smith says the refereeing could play a role in the outcomes. over there they have been very strict with TMO interventions, looking to three phases back, looking at pulling up anything, and you're getting these massive stoppages, you know, 10, 15 minutes sometimes, which is only going to help Ozzy sides. And he believes that extra attention from the television match officials will result in more red cards for dangerous play. Because the EMO is actively seeking out anything around rough time, I think what will happen is there will be potentially yeah just more infringements from a kiwi sites that have probably been going under the radar. While the Australian teams will be striving to make their mark during Super Rugby's first super round, it won't be such a super weekend for Moana Pacifica, who have now had their fourth game, and will have to wait until the 30th of April for their next game against the Melbourne Rebels. And that was Joe Porter there with that report, big week in a rugby. You're listening too. Morning report on R&Z national rain or showers across the done with their name. Namajiyoteata Corcoran Dantene, in this hour we discussed New Zealand's plan to boost security ties with Japan. Soaring inflation is expected to continue, will speak to a fuel operator and a representative of the trucking industry. Also before nine, new Blackburn's coach Wayne Smith will be with us. Russia claims victory in the battle for Maruyupol despite Ukrainian forces stubbornly holding on, and two Australian blue-tonged skinks have gone missing from Foxton's wildlife trust visitor settings. RNSN News at 8 o'clock, good morning, I'm Anna Thomas. New Zealand and Japan are bolstering security ties with a plan to share more classified information on international matters. The country's Prime Ministers, Jacinda Arderne and Fumio Kashida, met in Tokyo overnight. Speaking afterwards, Miza Dern said an information sharing arrangement will promote peace and security in the region. This partnership matters because Japan and New Zealand must cooperate in what is a deeply uncertain global environment. And officials have yet to negotiate what will be included in the information sharing deal. The United States is to send more than $1 billion in further military aid to Ukraine. President Joe Biden says the nature of the warfare on Ukraine's eastern front means different equipment is required as the BBC is Nomia Iqbal. He said the war on the Eastern Front was different in nature and so the weapons will include dozens of artillery systems and more tactical drones. In a new round of sanctions any Russian affiliated ships will also be banned from using American. as well as the military aid, Ukraine will get a further $500 million of direct economic assistance from the US. And a US satellite firm says it has identified a mass burial site containing about 200 graves near Marjupol. A city Russian forces have been trying to rest control of for weeks. Maxa said its images showed an expansion of graves that began at the end of March. Local Ukrainian officials accused the Russians of burying Marjupal civilians killed by Russian troops there. Moscow has not yet commented on the report. An economist says pressure is on the government to extend the cut in the fuel tax as an anti-inflationary move. Inflation hit 6.9% in the year to March, the biggest rise since mid-1990. Infometrics-principal economist Brad Olson told first up, the temporary cuts in fuel tax has helped to keep inflation below 7%. The government now has to figure out when it whacks back on 25 cents a leader either that or they've got to continue to subsidize $350 million a quarter of infrastructure spending from debt funding. The government says New Zealand's not immune to global economic challenges. European leaders have slammed the French presidential candidate Maureen LePain in a joint article published in newspaper L√©monde. The German Chancellor and the Spanish and Portuguese Prime Ministers say Ms LePain has conspired with anti-democratic forces and they hope President Emmanuel Macron wins. These voters are divided on who they will vote for in Sunday's election. Marie Le Pen goes to markets to meet working people like us. She's down to earth. We've always liked her. Marie Le Pen. Marie Le Pen, even if she tries to distance herself from the extreme right, that's her background, that's her party. I'm voting Macron to keep up and out. Emmanuel Macron was seen to come out on top in yesterday's televised election debate. The chairperson of women in Rugby Altioroa says the Blackfern's new coaching appointment is a smart move, but it's a band-aid. Former blackferns head coach Glenn Moore stepped down following the release of a scathing review into the team's culture and environment. Wayne Smith, the former All-Black's coach, is the new coach and will be assisted by Wesley Clark and Whitney Hansen. Chairperson of women in rugby altiaroa, Tracy Ho-Papa, says they're a good team things but there are Wahene who could be coaching the black phones instead. We've got Wahine who could step into the role now. Indira has chosen to parachute and some exceptional coaches. Right now we need to see Indira taking the review report seriously and putting Wahene Rugby a front and centre. Tracy Hohapa says years of under-resourcing of women's rugby is now showing. More on this coming up in our sports bulletin. Towns north of Wellington that were once thoroughfares for state highway one are now quiet seaside settlements. Transmission galley opened just three weeks ago diverting traffic away from Pugurua Bay in Pakakariki. The co-owner of Greedy and Co. Coffee Caravan, Sarah Kirk Patrick, says the reduction in traffic is having a positive impact on her business and the Pugurua Bay community. People on the other side of Pupuuuuuuua are coming over more because there's not that know, because it used to be very hazardous to try and pull out on the main road. The community's kind of coming together more, I think. And Pakeriki, resident Svenya Donlin, says the town's once busy intersection onto the highway is now much safer, and even without heavy traffic going past the town is bustling. The search for a missing fisherman in Tre Riri in the Bay of Plenty is set to resume this morning. Jason Kota did not return from a fishing trip on Sunday morning. Search and Rescue personnel and surf life saving will continue searching the Bay of Plenty coastline today. The recreation of trenches and a fortified par at the site of of the Battle of Rangariri in North Waikato in 1863 is expected to spark interest in the true story behind the New Zealand land wars. Local Ihihingatignaho has built this site with help from a nearly three million dollar government grant. Ebytia person, Brad Totarewa, says the 130 meters of trenches replicating what was at the original fortified power site is a way of retelling the history of the New Central Wars. It's designed for deception. So while the soldiers were there invading, they were deceived by its infrastructure, the significant parts of the dead. From a distance of five meters, it looks like a two-meter wall. An actual fact, when you get right up to it, it's five and a half meters. The Rangarelli project will be officially opened by King Tuhetia Botato, Teferofero, Teftoo Fito. And that's the news. Now, the sport here's sport, here's Barry Guy. New Blackfins director of Rugby Wayne Smith says the side is ready to move on from the departure of Glenn Morris head coach. Smith replaces Moore who resigned following a review into the Blackfins Environment which was highly critical of New Zealand rugby and it's resourcing to the side. Smith says the team is different to any other he's coached. The women in this team are vibrant, are really keen to create an environment and environment he's coached. The women in this team are vibrant. They're really keen to create an environment that's fun. It's exciting. You know, they might do a rap when someone else stand up and give a talk, a different team to what I've had before. And it's exciting. I love it. The Blackferns Harper, Kendra Cox, Koxage, says he had no issues with Glenn Moore and says some players plan to do something for their former coach when the time is right. Ukrainian tennis player Elena Switelina says Russian and Belarusian players who speak out against Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be allowed to compete at Wimbledon. Yesterday the All England Tennis Club banned players from the two countries from competing at this year's tournament. Gavening bodies, the ATP and WTA described the decision as unfair. Sfitalina says the Russian players silence is disappointing. We don't want to ban completely them but we just want them to speak up to say their choice if they are with the rest of the world or they are with Russian people and the Russian government. The Russian world number eight Andre Rublev says the Wimbledon ban is complete discrimination.

As we've been reporting this morning, the subject of China's growing influence on the Indo-Pacific has taken center stage in Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's discussions with her Japanese counterpart for Muokishida in Tokyo. The two countries are yet to negotiate an agreement that would see us share more information on international security issues. Jeffrey Miller and international analyst with the Democracy Project has been following the changing security map and joins us now. Tenaku Jeffrey, now what would be on the table in these negotiations? the changing security map and joins us now. Then, I would you free? Now, what would be on the table in these negotiations? Good morning, Manny. Well, we don't know an awful lot. Sounds like that New Zealand and Japan have agreed to undertake negotiations for an intelligence sharing agreement, so it's quite theoretical, but I think it's a hugely symbolic step and Jacinda Arden really is gradually remaking New Zealand's foreign policy. And we've seen a number of steps this year, particularly over Ukraine, and sending lethal aid. But also with Solomon Islands, the way that Jacinda Arden has talked, she's really important New Zealand on the same page as Australia and the US talking about the Pacific being our backyard which is quite unnatural language I think which is in the I don't be using so she's quite forthright and you know Japan is another step in award towards this new strategy of aligning New Zealand more with the West and with Japan as well which is becoming part of this wider Western alliance if you like against China. what risks does this carry? Well New Zealand has got 20 billion dollars worth of exports that go to China every year. It's our biggest trading partner and we've seen what's happened to Australia when they've challenged China over the origin of COVID-19 for example when Scott Morrison called for an investigation into that China slapped tariffs on Australian products like wine and barley exports. So there are real risks to New Zealand. New Zealand has really done a balancing act over the last 20 years or so, or even longer, and it's actually worked out quite well for New Zealand. We've had a fought in both camps. We've been part of the West, we've been part of the Five Eyes, but we've developed a very strong trading relationship with China. So if we are going to edge into the West and keep edging further into the Western camp, that really does pose quite a risk to New Zealand in my view. Now do you see this as a step, as you describe it, symbolic step to orientering those more formal security arrangements in particular with the United States, for example? Yes, and Jacinda Aduin gave interviews to the BBC and to NHK Japanese television yesterday, and she was asked in both of those interviews about the New Zealand would join Orcus' New Deal between Australia to UK and the US. She didn't rule without exactly. I think that's still probably less likely. Another option could be that New Zealand rejoins Anzis more formally. Remember New Zealand has been on the outer with Anzis since 1986 when the US has been that its obligations to New Zealand. But a third option could be that New Zealand joins a new alliance, perhaps based on the quad arrangement. The quad arrangement contains Japan, India, the US and Australia. And it's been talked about before as a quad plus deal. And New Zealand has been part of some meetings for that notably over the COVID response back in the early stages of the pandemic. It's possible that that could always be expanded, be more formalized. I think this intelligence sharing arrangement, whatever it is that's being agreed to at the moment, is perhaps another step along the way to that. Jacinda Arderne is making incremental steps. We've seen so many incremental steps that's here in the way that she's remaking in the foreign policy and the end goal could well be, being part of a more formal military alliance with other countries in the other countries in the West. the way that she's remaking your and foreign policy and the end goal could well be you've even been part of a more formal military alliance with other countries in the West and with bikes of Japan. Cute for your time this morning in that analysis, that is Jeffrey Miller, an international analyst with the Democracy Project, it is a quarter past eight. Back to the inflation story now and fuel prices were a major ingredient in yesterday's 30-year record inflation figures. To talk more about this we're joined by Nick Leggott who is the chief executive of the Trucking Association Transport in New Zealand Dave Bodger, the general manager of Gold Petroleum Kilda Khodrara to both of you. If I could start with you first, Nick Leggott, Trucking, Transport things around the country, is there anything that could be done in the short term to bring down costs and prices? Well I think the government has made a pretty impressive effort both on households but also in terms of the trucking industry in terms of the discount that has been offered up at start yesterday on road user charges around about 36% we calculate that will ease costs for road transport businesses and ultimately I believe their customers in the short term it's for three months but it's it's a good signal and you know the thing about transport businesses, they're like households, they have the same sort of cost pressures and most of them are small businesses with fewer than 10 employees. So it is I think a very good start but of course you know we are this is a world economic feature and New Zealand is but part of that. Yeah and so in terms of truck drivers your labour any other ways in which you can improve things? Well look part of the cost pressure of course is going to be on wages and we're an industry that has been short of drivers prior to COVID that only got worse with COVID. I think there's a problem in terms of losing staff to Australia that's sort of, I think, upon us. But we've worked with the government to start a traineeship during COVID to bring people into the industry. We're pretty focused on that. it is about I think employers as well recognizing that to keep people they've got to be engaged, they've got to be trained, they've got to be invested in and obviously they've got to be paid. So that's something that I think the industry has to confront. The government is supportive of that. but a lot of this has actually just got to be less to business to sort out and the thing for transport is a service provider it's often the sort of meat in the sandwich it's got to ensure that its full costs are charged to its customers because to keep a supply chain going we've got to have viable businesses. Okay Dave Bodger from Gult Petroleum give us a snapshot of where petrol prices in the world markets and these sort of things have landed at the moment. Seems to me about two dollars seventy for your 91, is that about right? Things across the country and you've got an extra 12 cents for your petrol in Auckland with the Auckland regional fuels tax like our prices range lowest around mid two thirties and out here Murray our highest will be around two sixty I think for today for petrol but look I mean you know huge huge sympathies for our next team look diesel's gone up if you look at it when he hours a hundred and fifty five dollars a barrel that's up seventy five dollars a barrel since December. Just minutes per liter is a simple action. That's a huge whack as an exception for a small business owner that's, you know, maybe herself or up to 10 employees and that's a huge, is there diesel cross. We know your margins have been looked at closely by the Commerce Commission and others. There's probably not much room to push you much further there, is there? Or do you think we could? Look, the margins are a competitive market, and look, we do everything we can to keep ours as low as possible. We pioneer unmanned service stations, we run through a one terminal model, we're very strong in the up and north island which is close to our terminal. And look landlords don't particularly like us because we don't like paying a lot of rent. But I think you know it's going forward you know there's some things in the in the oil industry the price of carbon is probably going to go up and not a lot of people know you know for Petrel and Eezle you're paying 20 to 24 cents a leader including GST for the emissions trading scheme now just give me a quick snapshot on the world market for oil again around hundred dollars a barrel do you see that the the wars kind of beaded in into those prices now isn't it? so look let's all hope and pray for non-escalation, escalation would be worse outside of the immediate area it's in now, but you know there's possibly 45 bucks a barrel for future or 75 bucks a barrel for come out of that if things de-escalate, so that's you, that is a positive looking forward. Last word to you, Nick Leggett, for from the Truckies, is there any hope that cost you can be more productive, you can be more efficient, you can find ways to get those costs down? Well, I think that is the challenge that faces any part of the supply chain and I think that Dave's said it right. right I mean every business has to be competitive to stay alive so that kind of those are the things that I think are going to be demanded more by customers of the industry and it's certainly something that the industry is turning its mind to how do they demonstrate that they are reducing their emissions by being more more efficient by ensuring that there's better collaboration to move stuff around, particularly when we've got these international pressures. And New Zealand, of course, is at the end of the supply chain, where at the moment of world, so it costs more to move things to it, and that supply assurance that we get from shipping is a bit more compromised as well. So there are lots of factors that are pushing costs up here. All right, Nick Leggett, thank you very much. Chief Executive of Transporting New Zealand and Dave Bodger, the general manager of Gold Petroleum, discussing the inflation precious 21 minutes past eight. The Blackferns have a new coach, Senator's former, all- Black Wayne Smith. He has just over five months to help the team defend their World Cup title. The Blackferns were soundly beaten and in four tests against England and France at the end of 2021. Coach Wayne Smith, aka the professor, joins us now. Cure Wayne? Cure O'er Mani. Now five months, what needs to be done in order to keep that title? Well, we started the process, looking at the game, changing some things up, trying to make it exciting, trying to use their advantage, which I think is probably skills and speed and athleticism. The biggest issue will be whether we can catch up in terms of strengthening divisioning, given a lot of the girls overseas that come from professional programs and again that's quite a while. So that's a challenge I think. How confident are you about being able to defend the title? Well I really enjoyed girls so this is my second camp they're on the edge of the of the seats constantly, they've got shining eyes, they want to learn a great attitude. Yeah, and we'll bring in some different stuff that hopefully is exhilarating for them and the country. Too early to talk about how I think we're going to go. But you know, if we can do something really exciting and get the country behind us, you never know what sort of waves we can do something really exciting and get the country behind us you never know what sort of wave we can create. Look Wayne it's been a few trial and tribulations with the report coming out Glenn Moore stepping down looking forward and looking to that horizon what sort of things do you want to put in place in order to change the culture and and and create a team that we won't have to see another report like that happen again. Yeah, I don't know if there's so much of a culture change. I think the culture is really good. So clearly there are some initiatives you can put in place. We've got what I call a flourish program going to be put in place to try and create a bit more grit and resilience. There's other things around red to blue, you know that we've done the all that set all bring into this program as well to ensure that the girls aren't feeling the pressure quite so much. They've got initiatives in place to be able to cope with stuff like that. I think any high performance program today has got to follow similar lines, you think, or I think any high-performance program to those got to follow similar lines, you know, and so we'll put those in places as we go, girls will be positive towards it, so yeah, I can't envisage any major issues. In terms of the coaching lineup, you've got Whitney Hansen, the only female Wahene there, what is, and what should a succession plan look like in order to develop You've got Whitney Hansen, the only female Wahineh there. What is and what should a succession plan look like in order to develop more Wahineh to be in head coaching positions? Yeah, that's a really good question. When I was director of coaching for Canada, when I was a young fellow back in the 88, 88, 91. Three of my staff coaches back then who helped me with coaching courses in education, educating coaches, they were women players in the past year, Wong, Jackie Up the actor, Mary Davy, remember carrying Mary Davy's one month old baby for a and now while she coached contact to some coaches. And that's a long time ago, and it hasn't really progressed enough. Why? Why do you think it hasn't progressed? I think in a lot of women's sport it's been put to the side. Men's sport has tended to dominate. I think there's a wake-up call here and things will move pretty quickly. So as I just hear we've got Whitney and Squab. There are other women like Crystal Kawa for example who's assistant coach of Tous Manawa and there are others as well. Mel Bosman, men of riches, all sorts around the country. We just need to make sure that we put some resource into them and bring them through not just as coaches in the women's game but I like to see some in coaching the men's game. Why not? How long do you think it'll be until we see female head coaches? Not long hopefully because I know a lot of them and I know how capable they are and they just need an opportunity I think. Wayne I want to, we had a text in this morning saying that women's rugby is a waste of time. are. They just need an opportunity I think. Wayne I want to, we had a text in this morning saying that women's rugby is a waste of time to watch because it's no good. I'd like you to correct them. Well yeah that's what we're going to try and do. You're doing it already. They're already amazing to watch. Well yeah I think we can get better. I think we can do things slightly differently to the other teams. New Zealand rugby's always been able to reinvent itself and that's what we're going to do. We're going to try and do something exhilarating. I'll keep up for your time this morning. Spain's method is 26 minutes past 8. Russia has claimed victory in the battle for Marjub Pole despite Ukrainian forces stubbornly holding on. Russian president Vladimir Putin has told troops to ditch plans to storm a giant steel plant where the last Ukrainian defenders are cooped up and instead to seal it up. More than 100,000 people are still believed to be trapped in the besieged southern city. There the rare few who make it out usually end up in the southeastern city of Zeparicia. Earlier I spoke to New Zealand freelance journalist Campbell McDymid, who's just arrived in that city. Today was the first, they call it a green corridor, the first evacuation convoy to leads the city this week. And Ukrainian officials were hoping that they might be able to get about 6,000 people out of the city. They think they might be 100,000 people still living in the city, although it's pretty unclear how many actually remained there at this point. We saw four buses arrived today from Maripul after traveling for 24 hours through a dozen Russian checkpoints to get out of the city and they only had I think about 100 people on them in total so they were not able to get out as many people as they wanted to. And I think there's difficulties in negotiating safe passage with Russian troops and also getting the message out to civilians in Mariopool about these evacuation corridors because people have been living there without electricity for over 50 days. So some people have transister radio with batteries that they can listen to the radio, but other people are completely cut off from the outside world. I imagine that they are very hungry and traumatised from their experience. Yes, I mean the people I spoke to today coming out have been living without electricity and without running water for 56 days. Women told me today. So you know they haven't had a bath in that time. They've been able to get food from volunteers, but they've also been living on front lines with active fighting going on around them. And for some of these people have been forced to move from one building to another as fighting as got close. So what is the sense now about Marupo? Is it that the city has fallen, all be it the steel works, to the Russians? They are now in complete control of it, and will they then allow that 100,000 or so civilians to get out? Or is that unclear? I mean, there's a real concern that people who want to come back into Ukrainian controlled territory are not going to be able to.... I'm concerned that people who want to come back into Ukrainian controlled territory are not going to be able to. So some of the people, I spoke to a couple of teenage boys today who were worried that when they got on the bus that they were going to be taken to Rostov in Russia because they've heard reports and Ukrainian officials have said that she has been forcibly transferring citizens to Russia. They've been pinned down trying to control that city, which a crucial city for them if they want to establish you know land route between their their separatist territories in the East and Crimea which they annexed back in 2014 but now they seem to be moving troops away from Maripol to take more territory in the Don Bath. Just finally I mean are you safe where you are that's an important hub if people are going there, but is that somewhere Russia is kind of given up on or were they potentially targeting you there too? Yeah, there was a number of missile strikes here today. They targeted a bridge over the river here and they also targeted the railway line. So we heard those in the city today. Strikes on the city and denepra where I've also been staying targeted at strategic installations. So you'd have to be very unlucky or really in the wrong place at the wrong time. But there's always the risk of those munitions kind of missing their target. And that is New Zealand freelance journalist Campbell McDymid's there reporting from Ukraine. Half-par State, time to catch up with Giles Beak, but now for a market update. Thank you Karen. Wall Street started positive, but it's closed negative.

He says people should still check with their local RSA's to find out if there is a service in their area. And police are resuming the search for missing missing fisherman in Torredi this morning. Land search and rescue and surf life-saving will continue searching along the coastline. Yesterday a coastguard aircraft spotted a 100 litre white chili bin thought to belong to the missing fishermen that had washed up on Whale Island. And that's the news. Kilda, I'm Alexia Russell and today on the detail, there's a new big wave of Irish migration to New Zealand. A look at how the two countries are closer than ever before and why the Irish feel right at home here. We've got these wonderful connections. And of course, once you kind of wrote you're over there, and you're realizing you think, well,, absolutely, you can see how that happened.

The government has named nine areas that will play a key role under sweeping health reform soon to be implemented. From July, the country's 20 district health boards will be abolished and replaced by organizations known as localities. The first of those were named yesterday. They are Otara, Hoorakitopo, Waidawi,anui, Parirua, West Coast, Eastern Bay of Plenty, and Hora Fanoa. They'll organize health services for their communities, but a region of high health need, Northland, wasn't included yet, anyway. More articam, I believe. Joining us now is the chair of the General Practice Owners Association, Gen Pro, Dr Tim Malloy, who's a long-up- leader in Northwood. Cioro, welcome to you. Morena, Colin. OK, what do you make of this format? Some say it's more bureaucracy and not necessary. And the National Party is not so keen. What do you make of it? There is some concern that we are spending a lot of resource on a new structure, when our current frontline health workers under immense pressure both in terms of workforce and resourcing so that is a natural concern. Fair enough now but for Northland you haven't been named yet but you probably will be at some point because there's still a lot more of these localities as they're known to come, right? Absolutely. The intent, I understand, is that there will be rolled out across the whole country over the next two years. So that's going to be a significant process, and at each charge there'll be large numbers of localities coming on board. tranche there'll be a large numbers of localities coming on board. Now the localities they'll have effectively, but what, sort of a, they'll have a small, I imagine a bit of infrastructure, they have a commissioner and they work with Ewee and they will essentially be able to get a reading, a handling on what a specific area needs in terms of its health. I mean that sounds pretty good. Oh, absolutely. From a's perspective and intent, absolutely admirable. The problem of the course is that it does involve a significant number of resource to or amount of resource to coordinate services, particularly in the community where it may or may not already exist. Uh And that represents a new challenge for these locations. Yes, and I imagine it may be difficult trying to attract the right talent into those sorts of jobs. They'll be quite important roles in order to ensure that people are advocating and getting what they need in terms of resources from the... from central government. I would imagine that mostly they'll be staffed out of current providers systems as compared to DHBs which will continue to be managed through the health New Zealand infrastructure. It's interesting isn't it? So we've had a system with the DHBs where people are a board that then represents their communities and provides that feedback. They're now moving to this system. Do you see it working better? I mean, it's arguable that people, you know, how many people actually voted for those health boards knowing who they were voting for? Oh absolutely. There's no question that there were some problems with the system that apparently is absolutely. The question is, will this deliver on its promises of a better, more coordinated service? I think one of the important points in the implementation is that there is an intention to learn from the first off the block localities and if we can gain insights from that that will apply across the country then perhaps we may be able to do things better. That's interesting so these these initial nine areas will it'll be really important to to study those you, see how it's worked. Absolutely, and I look at it with interest, for example, the range of populations in the different localities range from, I think it's about, 14,000, right through to 117,000. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty interesting. You got the west coast on the one hand, a very spread out population across a big area and Yeah, I mean, it's pretty interesting. You've got the West Coast on the one hand, a very spread out population across a big area, and then, you know, Otara, Potiwu, Hohraki. Pretty interesting. Absolutely. So they've chosen clearly quite a range of variable localities, I guess, to test out some of the premises that are proposed in the new Cisco. Very good. Thank you very much. Tim Malloy, Dr Tim Malloy there, long-standing GP in the north and the area, the country I guess getting its head around these new health reforms and how they are going to work, is 19 minutes to 9. In some of your feedback on the text machine, 2-1-1 on inflation, John says the two main areas of inflation in New Zealand are groceries and building supplies, both controlled by a very small number of participants which keeps the prices up, reform is long overdue. On the interview with Blackferns coach Wayne Smith, Katie has texted in er, can someone tell Wayne Smith that the players are women, not girls? This listener says, please everyone stop calling the black ferns girls. Please honour their manner and refer to them as women or wahini, girls is the term for children. In the context of following the damning review, calling these elite sports women, girls continues to diminish them. And this person says, wow, that was a kick in the teeth when Wayne Smith pretty much agreed with the person who said women's rugby isn't good enough to watch by saying we're trying to improve but I'm not... did he mean that? Did he interpret my... Well no I just wonder whether he was sort of trying... his starting point was obviously the black friends that had very poor form over in Europe with the four losses but but maybe he did I don't know it's certainly what one... When you're trying to promote the World Cup you know? Yes anyway, wha knew. Why he knew? Why he knew all the way. On course for the government to buy at homes and flood prone areas, warrant says no way should taxpayers buy people out. Warnings are in place now, they should get out. And Mike and Hamilton, people choose to live beside rivers and have had the enjoyment of living near the water, so the taxpayer should not be expected to bail them out by having to buy them out by having to buy their properties. 17 minutes tonight. Thank you for your feedback. And if you're in Pournique, Wellington, it's soon time to put on your dancing shows. The Eat Drink Play Festival is coming in May and organisers say it's time to enjoy good quiet drinks and entertainment. joining us now is the hospitality NZ President and one of the festival organiseses Jeremy Smith. Jeremy, tell us about this festival. Good morning. Yeah, it's, the timing has been fantastic. We've hoped very much that we'd be back in orange just in time for the festival. And it all started a couple of years ago when a group of hospitality owners got together and said, we can sit and complain about how tough it is under COVID, or we can do something about it. And we chose to put a feasible together that was aimed at the hospitality sector, collaborating to try and support each other, support the performers and artists, and most importantly, support our suppliers, who do it pretty hard. And we managed to get something going last year on a Shaston budget and very short timelines get it done and and this year we had got a much better, bigger festival lined up great support from Wellington in Z, incredible support from suppliers in the industry and all the owners have got together and we're as volunteers are the ones who are making this festival happen. Yeah tell us who's playing what what should we expect? The list is enormous we're very lucky your favorite who are your favorites? and Julia Dean's is going be one of the ones I want to go to. There's... There's... Bonnabe. Where are we going to be playing in a couple of guys' one with some of his fellow band members, some he's going to do some solo acts. We've got the Kubadupa guys that have come to the party and given us access to a lot of their performers. And so we're going to have a huge array of live music, drag, burlesque, and we're very pleased that we're going to be running a quiz through a lot of the cafes over, so 10 o'clock, 10 to 12. People go and buy a copy at the local coffee shop and into the quiz the daily quiz that you can enter and all going well in the systems work will be able to announce a winner at the end of the the festival. So we're trying to include everybody in and create opportunities for people to have their play components and be created around that. sounds great. Thanks for your time this morning. That is Jeremy Smith. One of the... to have their play components and be corrected around that. Sounds great. Thanks for your time this morning. That is Jeremy Smith, one of the festival organizers of each drink and play. It is quarter to nine. We love a quiz. That sounds like a good idea. Quiz and coffee. I like the sound of that. Jillia Davis is what I want to go there. Yes, very good. Then for a minute to tell us what's what's coming up on nine to nine to More than a current, yet first of all we're looking at importers here warning of acute supply chain issues to New Zealand caused by COVID lockdowns in China, disruption at Shanghai Port, the world's largest, has caused a backlog of more than 500 ships waiting to dock, not going to be resolved quickly, so we're looking at the impact for our importers and for us as consumers. Also looking at a burial that's going to take place of a mysterious gold miner. His body was found some 40 years ago on the banks of the Clutha River, simple wooden coffin. actually it was found out that his grave had been robbed, had been dug up earlier, his remains disturbed. So after research and study there is a move now to find a proper burial and a final resting place for him and after 10 we're in Borneo with conservationist Chavez Shema champion of the heavily trafficked Pangolin one the most endangered species in the world and a real pioneer and eco-tourism such a beautiful binderverse part of world. So he'll talk us through that after 10 on 19 noon. Kilda Lynn. Now, missing, two adorable, unadorable baby Australian blue-tongued skinks. The 15 centimetre skinks were lent by a collector to the wildlife Foxton Trust. visitor centre. But earlier this week they disappeared. They disappeared. visitor center but earlier this week they disappeared in their concerns they were stolen. Nola Fox from the trust joins us now. Couldn't all of what's happened? Marina, we have them little babies on loan because we're a environmental education trust so we're open to the public, we give tours and when I checked on them Tuesday after we'd had some port tours through on Monday, they were missing and no one else has access to the premises, so we can only think that one of our visitors, when we weren't looking, decided to put them in their pockets and walk out with them. So they couldn't have escaped then? No, we're talking these lovely little skinks have two centimetre long legs. They're exotic. little skanks have two centimetre long legs, they're an exotic, so they don't have permit requirements to be held in New Zealand, but they are highly sought after because there's only a few breeders around New Zealand who breed them from time to time. So do you think someone's stolen them to sell them or could it be a matter of maybe a young person thinking that they're really cool that they want to show their mates at school? Given the people that we're here, we're fairly sure it was an adult that actually took them and they would want them because they are valued at starting at birth 150. These were valued at $200 each. When they get to adult size, they're valued at $350. And they, we have them here to show people the difference in size for our beautiful Nizar natives who are much smaller and don't breed as well. So what's the plan now? Have you told the police? Yes, we've got a police report in. We're hoping they can access our... Have you told the police? Yes, we've got a police report in. We're hoping they can access our, they go in for an application for the um, chasing, contact, chasing team to access the names of the people who scanned them that day. And that will identify the possible suspects. We're hoping that somebody will hear about this, feel guilty, bring them back, no questions asked or else they can go to our Give a little page and donate the $400 that would have been donated to the Trust to help it grow and to give the education to people on what's happening to all I forgot, Warner. Oh I hope you can find them, That is Nola Fox and you can hop on to the wildlife Foxon Facebook page or the website wildlife Foxon.com to help out if you know anything about these missing skinks. It's a little bit to bring back the skinks. Now here's someone who would be very alarmed by that story David Attenborough and he has been given a United Nations Lifetime Achievement Award. The broadcaster has made some of the most acclaimed television documentaries on the natural world. Now the UN's environmental program has named him champion of the earth. The BBC's Justin Rollett reports. And let me just say that we are deeply honoured to... Like so much of life today, this award ceremony was conducted over the internet, but there was nothing virtual about Sir David's delight. Oh, you have the award, wow! I'm truly, truly extremely honoured. You know, the United Nations, without them we will never solve the environmental crisis. The world has to get together. Sir David tells Inga Anderson, the head of the UN Environment Program. The world has to get together. Sir David tells Inga Anderson, the head of the UN Environment Programme, that he has not lost hope. Look how many whales species have come back from the brink of extinction, he says. The message is that it is possible. The message is that the natural world has more resources than we can possibly imagine. We've worked out how to kill them. Now we could give them a chance for them to come back and save themselves and save us. We know what the problems are and we know how to solve them, says Sir David. The challenge now is to come together as a world community and to take action. That is the BBC's just in roll it there, nine minutes to nine. The recreation of trenches and a fortified par in North Waikato is the start of a venture by local Eui to tell the true story of the Battle of Rangiridi. which happened more than 150 years ago in November 1863. In November 1863, it was one of the pivotal battles of the New Zealand Land Wars in Waikato. The Rangiri historical and cultural heartland project has received nearly $3 million to rebuild the battle trenches and in time open an education centre. It will officially be opened up war war tomorrow. Our reporter Andrew McCray visited Rangirian spoke to the man whose vision nine years ago led to the project. In the vision was to give voice to our ancestors and to give voice meant that I had to rebuild a significant part of the trenches like that of my ancestor. Chairperson of Turunananat Nati Naho Brad Totorewa. His great-great-grandfather was the engineer behind the original fortifications at Rangiriri. We are! We are led through 130 metres of rebuilt trenches. From the top you could look down on the Waikotho River and Lakes Kupu Era and Waikare fully understanding the strategic location of the site. It's designed for deception. So while the soldiers were there invading, they were deceived by its infrastructure. There's significant parts of a day. From a distance of five meters, it looks like a two meter wall. In actual fact, when you get right up to it, it's five and a half meters. Mr. Totorewa says recreating a replica of trenches used in battle is a way of retelling the history around the New Zealand wars. The crown's narrative in 1800 was merely to invade and to annihilate. it's written in the proclamation. Afro nations who fail to swear allegiance to Queen Victoria are here by required to return beyond the Mangatar Fili in Waiter or they will be ejected. The context of the word eject is exactly the same as annihilate. And so yeah, we weren't supposed to be here today telling our story, what we have. and that hasn't really changed in nearly 159 years. You see individual graves, and each and every single one of those individual graves belong to the British soldiers, and then you see this one mass grave, you know, and in that mass grave lays the bodies of our ancestors. And to me, that's a sign of inequality, the fiscal manifestation of inequality, racism, all that type of stuff that still exists today. Gomato of Vince Hapi says women and children played their part in building and defending Rangareri, and the replica power and trenches honours Omarari who fought and died there. He says this will not be lost on people visiting the site. They can feel the hurt, they can feel the mamai and they can also feel the sadness of what actually happened back then. It's similar to, you know, you have the arrow saying let's not we forget. It's no different, let's not we forget. Moa Ketonata, we shall fight forever. 7th will open the Rangariri replica site. The day will include battle reenactments and kappahaka. It is five minutes to know and that is time to cross the Tasman and talk to our camera correspondence. Kerry and Welsh, good morning. Good morning, Corin? No boy. Big news overnight, Anthony Albanese, the Labour opposition leader, COVID-19, positive. Yeah.. leader, COVID-19 positive. Yep. Yes, just a week and a bit into the campaign and he's off now isolating at home for seven days. The campaign headquarters of course had a contingency plan so he's going to ramp up health permitting of course, he's going to ramp up talk back and a lot of radio interviews and TV interviews from home so maintain a sort of cyber presence or an electronic presence on the campaign but he won't be out and about and he's not going to be glad handing and that you know mad zigzagging across the country to attend events in marginal seats and sprinkle you know money about or promises money if labor wins power. All of that will be sidelined for seven days. Now I talked to a few labor people last night and and there is a bit of a blessing in this if we want to use a word of the week which is that he can reset his campaign after a not so glorious start and he can focus a lot more on talking to people through the medium of radio which is far is far reaching in Australia because we have so much remote and regional areas that is simply impossible to get to, but you can through the ABC network in various other ways. So you know there's that going for it but presence on the campaign trial yeah well it gets him he hasn't as you say it's been cross-crossing across the country and these sort of PR events haven't worked that well for him but I suppose it's contingent on him being healthy so fingers crossed for his own sake that he well exactly I mean he doesn't appear to have he said he was feeling fine. He got a shock when he got the PCR results saying that he had tested positive. So he seems to have either no or relatively minor symptoms at this early stage, so he says he's in good health. So he's just at home, isolating. You mentioned the word blessing and this was a reference to the debate in which Scott Morrison got himself and trouble talking about that were being blessed with children that weren't disabled. That was a clunky, clangor, wasn't it? Absolutely, absolute shocker. People immediately reacted including the Australian of the year Dylan Alcott who's our fabulous wheelchair tennis champ and he said look I woke up this morning feeling he tweeted I woke up this morning feeling blessed and my parents feel blessed I'm pretty sure and Anthony Albanese is quick retort with every child is a blessing I mean it's just it's an extraordinary way to look at life that you are blessed if you don't if you have a somebody who is or children that are perfect in every way. He was forced into a very rare apology but that was after only about three or four hours of defending himself and doubling down but he always does when he's found out but the the backlash was so vicious that he was forced into a contrite apology you know around about midday one o'clock yesterday so uh... he will do what is necessary and he saw that uh... it wasn't he was not a winner to double down uh... so you do have to wonder about the sincerity of the apology but there you go that was a pretty... what were there being more debates as a strange-looking debate to bait that one. There wasn't very flashy. No, it wasn't flashy. It had no energy to it. I mean, it was just sort of, you know, boring. I think the facilitation of it was pretty banal. You do have to have a lively mediator. You have to have somebody that's jumping in and really trying to poke them, and that wasn't happening but also the audience was strangely mute it was a very flat event there will be another one so let's hope that you know maybe they can all go the pub before very good thank you very much Kerry and Walsh that's us for today Kiramani thank you good luck with the insect days sewning kura alright koran thanks everyone for having me stay safe out there have a beautiful beautiful weekends or are my Curent, alright Corrin, thanks everyone for having me. Stay safe out there, have a beautiful weekend. What am I? The Chatein Petrel"}
