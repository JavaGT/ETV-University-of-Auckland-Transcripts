Well, finally the long, long weekend and another long weekend next week. With sickness and restrictions, the last few months have felt like a bit of a slog, which makes it an ideal time to get away. Easter is here, and that means a long weekend and for some school holidays. And to add icing on the cake, we're in orange. More freedom at last. There's nothing like a holiday to recharge and reset. After a hard slog, it's time to get away and dust off the cobwebs. But at the last minute, what are our options? Where should we go? What should we do? And is it too late for a mini-vacay? And for more on this, we're joined by Brent Thomas from House of Travel. Good to see you, Brent. Now, long weekends and school holidays coming up, what are the last-minute options for people who want to get away? Well, realistically, if they were thinking about going overseas, they really are a little bit too late. The reason is that there's very few airlines coming to New Zealand right now, and people have been booking over the last few weeks. So if people are thinking about school holidays, they really need to be thinking about the July school holidays or the October ones. Maybe closer to home they could be looking for some of those adventures around New Zealand and seeing what beautiful places they are in New Zealand to visit. And, Brent, have you got some tips for families keen on a package deal? Look, there certainly are some great deals out there. Places like the Gold Coast you can get over there for seven nights, for A49, and you can get to places like Fiji even, go to Plantation Island, 1169 per person. They are really good prices, you know, considering things like airfares have moved up, price of fuels gone up, it's not unexpected that we have seen the price of air fares go up there for. And also, we've got limited capacity, but what I can say is the flights are filling up. New Zealanders have been booking in record numbers over the last six weeks, and we highly recommend people to get beyond just the planning stage and get onto the booking stage right now. Okay, what about around New Zealand? Around New Zealand there's some great opportunities because obviously inbound tourism hasn't arrived yet. Yes, the Australians are starting to come, but really the numbers are very small because of the restrictions around having to fill out and inbound cards, etc., in terms of COVID. So really what people need to do is take advantage go to places like Milford Sound which often get crowded in winter and and summer that is for when tourists come go to places like Rotorua friends Joseph maybe even the Coromandel and Bay of Island they are the places that people can be visiting this holidays with the kids and Brent where have people booked to go what are the hot spots this Easter here and overseas? Well, most people have been booking very close to home in terms of places like Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji. They've been very popular. But also, we've certainly seen a lot of people now booked to go to UK Europe. Part of the reason, of course, is they're looking to go and see family and friends, but also people have been stuck in New Zealand for more than two years. In fact, a lot of people, three to four years. So they're looking to go and see family and friends, but also people have been stuck in New Zealand for more than two years. In fact, a lot of people three to four years. So they're looking to go overseas and start travelling again and doing what Kiwi's love doing, which is seeing the world. Kiwi's starting to travel again. It's pretty exciting. Thanks, Brent. Great to talk to you. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. ASB and 7 Sharp, keeping you one step ahead. Now, it's a habit that's circling the globe. It's called going goblin mode, from slobbing out to simply embracing your inner diva. In short, it's treating yourself to whatever makes you happy, and why not? It started sometime during the pandemic eating cheese for breakfast wearing elasticised outfits, finding freedom and letting go of grooming routines triggering something inside of us, hidden but always there. Not a permanent identity, but a state of mind. Now as we step back into a sense of normality, is it time to tuck that goblin away. And clinical psychologist Jackie McGuire's here. Now, lovely to see you, Jackie. Tell us, why did the goblin come out? Well, I think you could look at this from a number of angles, Jeremy. If you take, you know, we're into our third year now of this pandemic, and people are tired. That's a neurophysiological response to living through uncertainty for a long time. So, you know, feeling like you're slothing on the couch probably is a natural fit to being tired. But I also think for people that have had two plus years now of working from home, not having to get dressed for work, kind of having that I'm in my space and I can just be me for that time, it becomes a habit. And is it that people don't care or are they just struggling with daily life? Well, if I look through this, through a clinical lens, Hillary, I would say you might start off with the odd day here and there of having what I would say in my language, a treat day. You can have your duvet day or you're staying your Jami's day or you'll eat crap food all day. And every now and then, that's absolutely fine. But if you have a continual pattern of that, that is the antithesis of good well-being and health. You know, if you don't have good nutrition, if you have poor sleep, if you don't take pride in yourself and your appearance, and therefore don't play into good self-worth, you know, that really is a highway to not feeling good. Jackie Goblin mode's almost the opposite of trying to better yourself. Why does that appeal to so many of us right now? Well, I think we live in an age sometimes where, you know, social media puts great expectations on people. And so I think not playing into this, I have to be perfect mode, is very helpful. That's a good thing. But I don't think the answer is ever to go to the polar opposite end. So I think, you know, some of the rhetoric that I read is, oh, we're not going to play into that stereotype. And therefore, I'm going to absolutely just embrace, you know, my natural self. And, you know, from that well-being perspective, taking pride in your appearance, putting, you know, good things into your body, having what we would call mental hygiene, which is like doing the basics every day to stay well, is critically important. So, you know, I think those people that may have slipped into a habit of this long term may find that actually they're struggling. Okay, Jackie, for those who are stuck in Goblin mode, what's one thing they can do to snap themselves out of it? Yeah, so if you were to look at languishing, which would be my clinical term for Goblin Mode, I would say choose one thing every day that you can do with purpose that brings you some sense of joy or satisfaction. That's really about behavioural activation. So if you're low in mood, if you're apathetic, if you are stuck in that rut, you know, the answer really is your Nike tick, just do it. You know, pick one thing that you enjoy that, you know, involves you going outside, cooking a nice meal for yourself, gardening, doing something that is pleasurable, but a mental hygiene, good mental health activity. You know, if you can commit to one thing a day, I think you'll notice over time that your mindset starts to shift. You may notice that you can commit to one thing a day, I think you'll notice over time that your mindset starts to shift. You may notice that you start to have more energy. And when you have more energy and you start to feel the good things, that's the motivation to keep building the positive mental hygiene behaviours into your life. Thanks, Jackie. Lovely to talk as always. Thanks, guys. Have good night. It's good to see you're out of Goblin mode. Yes, I made an effort tonight. You're going to host some awards later on, are you? Look, sometimes it's important, particularly with Easter coming up, to just, you know, turn on a bit of razzle-dazzle for the viewers. I don't appreciate my boss laughing at that in the corner. It's unbelievable. I take it from him. I don't need my boss laughing at that in the corner. It's unbelievable. I take it from him. I don't need it from you. Most domesticated cats in New Zealand are raised to enjoy plenty of fresh air on their fur and open spaces at their disposal. Jeez, you read that in an angry way. But there's a growing movement to keep your kitty contained in the backyard. Lucas Geong explains. Get out of here, you skellywag. This is Pussy Paradise, grass under their paws and a neighbourhood at their disposal. And then there are these two, locked away, living a life without freedom. Oh, they don't actually look that unhappy, Jackie. No. I thought they'd be a little bit more, you know, like downtrodden. It's a cat-ed enclosure. 14 metres long. Yeah. And three metres across. And for Elsa and Molly, this is their version of the Great Outdoors. 14 metres long and 3 metres across. And for Elsa and Molly, this is their version of the Great Outdoors. It gives them a lot more flexibility about where they can be and get fresh air at the same time without roaming the neighbourhood and causing harm or having harm done to them. A life in lockdown that Auckland Council is keen to encourage. Am I doing cat person or dog person? Cat person. Cat person. That's good for the story. Okay. It's something we're increasingly seeing recognition of. You know, we see the SPCA, the VET Association, all these organisations starting to recognise that actually this is what best practice cat ownership looks like. We're increasingly seeing some great products out there where actually, if you don't want to keep your cat entirely in your house, there are ways in which you can keep it on your property. Introducing the catio. Around the world, cat owners are creating cat patios, a safe place for their feline friends to be set sort of free. So who is this for? Is this to keep your cat safe or to keep the wildlife safe? It's both, actually. It's probably 50-50. They may be encountering poisons, traps, getting in catfights, dogs, even catnippers, depending on where you are and whether you've got a fancy cat. It's also about protecting the native wildlife as well. Although we love them, you know, our domestic cats can also have an impact too. And there are a range of options. But if a cat tries to go over the fence, it encounters the oscillot system, which is just a paddle, and it just spins when the cat touches it. Let's let pancake explain. Here you go, you're lighting it up. Yeah. You're going to, there you get. Oh! Oh, sorry, sweet, I don't meant to laugh. There's plenty of other cats made the same mistake. I am enjoying this far too much. Yul, does this actually hurt them at all? Oh, cats are so agile. No, by the time they've fallen even 1.8 meters, they feel embarrassed. And they go away and they hide for a little bit, no problem. Cat containment is a new concept for Kiwis, but around the world it's the norm. In other countries, perhaps the attitudes are different. Australia, for sure. In the ACT, in Australia, you must keep your cat contained. And year by year, the interest is picking up. There's been more awareness, I think, about cat safety. Whether it's a Cadillo Castle or in addition to the fence, it's what's inside that counts. Key as well is giving them a great environment that they're not keen to leave. So we have cat climbing posts, and we have great places for them to hide and to sleep. Molly, mum's gone now. Are you happy? Are you happy in here? Do you need help? They think they're the luckiest cats in the world. So maybe we need to embrace the cateo. Peppies! Peepie! Come on Pepe! Where are you? Just good luck convincing your cat. Every time. Certainly not climbing a fence in that dress. If I can A, coming up on 7-Sharp, what drove a rock and roll start to become a music teacher? Plus... Good-day, Jake. Will you meet again? Yeah.

He was suitably impressed, and now he wants all of us to find our way to the top of the country. Here's Michael Holland. Gooday, Jake. Will you meet again? Yeah. Who would have thought this time at the very tip of the country? Yeah. You had to come here. Yes. Very much. This is a requirement. An the country. Yeah. You had to come here. Yes. Very much. This is a requirement. An absolute must. Very. We last met 17-year-old Jacob when he was being top gun for a day. They think you're the pilot. Yeah, man. I am the pilot. What are you talking about? Five months on, Jacob's abdominal cancer is flexing its muscle and with that comes a cruel reality. This is Jacob's last wish. You just want to make every wish that he has come true because we know that he doesn't have much longer. Yeah, I just want to make him happy and have no regrets. So here they are, a long, long haul from their Danny Burke home. Wow. It's so pretty. Oh, it's just amazing. At a place of raw spellbinding beauty. How magical is this though? Amazing. Something that's hard to describe with the words. It's just weird. It's like there should be more island because that's what normally happens. You drive a little bit and there's more. But there is no more and it just, it's the end. The meeting of the seas and waves kind of hammering into each other, like in the middle of the ocean. Ridiculous. It's very, very bittersweet. Like the last thing on the bucket list, that's the way. We're so excited about being here. We are excited, but at the same time, heartbroken. If you don't expect to be ticking off your son's bucket list. That list full of fast action and spectacular sights, from jetboating and deep dives, to erode the length of the South Island, and, earlier this month, a mesmerizing flight to the southern lights. It was magnificent. A very unique experience to be in the Aurora, flying and looping around in it. It's just so cool. He definitely has accepted. He has a calm about him. And when I get worked up if I'm near him, he just kind of sends off calming vibes, eh? He just wants us to be all right. Jacobs go everywhere, do everything, nationwide journey, replacing a planned trip across the Tasman that fell victim to COVID. So instead of going overseas, we decided to explore our own backyard. And how would you describe the backyard? Like, breathtaking. The whole country is just wonderful. Just go do it. If it's in your power, go do it. There's no need to go to us. Exactly. It's overrated if you ask anything. That's the Tasman Sea. They're just over there. Yeah, I know. We can't be too loud. It's incredibly hard to know that this will be our last family trip. This is our last family trip. And the next one we go on, Jake won't be with us. And yeah, it's not easy. So being there, done that. Being there, done that. No regrets. Absolutely no regrets. How very inspiring you are, Jacob. Now a high school music teacher in Taranaki is causing a bit of a stir. Former Sons of Zion star Caleb Harpu has drifted away from band life to start a solo career. But he's also passing on his music knowledge to the next generation of songwriters. Carolyn Robinson sat in on a lesson. These halls are alive with the sound of music. Oh, practice that? Thank you. How you going? It might be lower voltage in the library. But the kids are amped. I'm teaching music here, it's Boswood. I turn around guitar and bass lessons, and I'm also taking group guitar as well. It's a new scene for Sons of Zion's Caleb Harpu, and he's loving the change in tempo. I'm really enjoying it. They call me Mr. H. Mr. H is best known as the voice of some of our favourite summer jams. A lot of them are like talking to me about, oh my mum's a big fan or my dad's a big fan. Can you sing for us? My mother is jealous because she used to go to his concerts back in the day. He's actually quite a good teacher, if you honest. What's it like being famous? How much money do you have? These are all the questions I could ask. That's all the questions I was going to ask. Yeah, I'm like, well, I've played a nobody, I'm broke. I don't know. For Caleb, those road trips had started to take a toll. I've kind of had just grown tired of the lifestyle. And I had obviously growing kids and a family. And I was never home. I was always on tour. Always in a different country. And I guess I just, yeah, I just kind of want to slow down and have a break from everything. And focus on a solo career. I've just released a new single called One Night. My love interest was my wife, so that was even cooler that we got to do that together. And he's performing under a new name. Tobias is my middle name. My parents chose the name from the Bible and the story of Tobias is he was a lone ranger. So after being in Sunday Zahn for so many years in a group and now leaving to be a sole ranger, that's me, Tobias. And that's not the only change. I've lost about 54KGs now, and many people don't recognise me. Until he sings. His solo album is due out next year. In the meantime, he's very happy jamming in the library. What's that song? Is it Metallica? Like, songs that I was learning, when I was 13, 14 years old, they're still learning the same songs. Just drift away. I'm kind of jealous. I wish I could sing like that. 10 hour 10 would recommend. Taranaki hardcore, as they say. Your life is actually amazing. Oh, just drift away. What a beautiful voice. Lucky kids getting to listen to that in the classroom all day. We'll be back in just a moment. Put your waxen song. We ain't telling no one. Let's take this talk on the ride. When your past catches up with you. Lots of clubbing when I was younger. It's definitely left bit smart. Is it possible to undo the damage? I want to change. I want to be able to smile more. I love it. It's very me. Are you ready to see this new you? Then Sally's sleepover. Oh, I've never seen anything like. Beautiful. Gets a little thrilling. What's going on this? I'll feel that.
