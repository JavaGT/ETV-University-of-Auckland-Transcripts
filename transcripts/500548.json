Today we're going to be working with these students to look at some different scenarios around understanding mental illness. We've designed these scenarios to make sure that they're all safe and that they can be inclusive for everyone in the regular classroom. Students that are experiencing mental illness don't need fear, concern, rejection. They need love, support and understanding. Why is it important for teachers to know this? Well, many teachers say it teaches college and learn to trigonometry, differential calculus and how to calculate parabolas.
