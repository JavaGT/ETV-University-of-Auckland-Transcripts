Hi, O'Re, Tefano, called Susie Ferguson. Pokoing o'i. Today on RNZ National, the Prime Minister begins her first international trade trip since the pandemic began. Hundreds of drunk drivers are getting away with never having an interlocked device fitted to their vehicles. Also seven people die as Russian missiles strike the western Ukrainian city of Leviv. And every year it happens and it's happening again this year. Hundreds of new teachers are being underpaid. Your weather today there's rain or showers with possible thunderstorms for the north of the North Island. Mainly find elsewhere. RNZ News at 6 o'clock. Good morning. I'm Anna Thomas. Ukraine says Russian bombardments of several cities in the country has killed at least nine people. Seven people died when multiple missiles hit the western city of Lviv, which has largely escaped attacks. Dan Johnson of the BBC reports from the city. Just before 8 a.m., there was another air raid warning across Lviviv. Within 40 minutes, missiles were streaking across the sky, then hitting the city. Just before 8 a.m. there was another air raid warning across Leviv. Within 40 minutes, missiles were streaking across the sky, then hitting the city. I saw and heard them myself, and I counted five explosions, five plumes of smoke darkening the clear bright morning. Officials say four targets were hit, three military warehouses, and a car garage and tyre centre, where four workers were killed. And Russia appears to be targeting Ukraine military facilities ahead of a major attack in the east of the country. Its defence ministry says it hit over 300 targets overnight. The Prime Minister has arrived in Singapore beginning her first international mission in more than two years. Jacinda Ardern is travelling with Trade Minister Damien O'Connor, ministry officials and a 12 strong business delegation in the media. All were tested for COVID-19 before departing Auckland and again on arrival in Singapore. Ms Ardern has a busy schedule today including a sit-down and then media conference with her Singaporean counterpart Lee Seng Lung. They're expected to discuss trade and regional security. Investigations run away after a Taranaki man was fatally shot by police on Saturday. 22-year-old Chaos Price was traveling in convoy with another vehicle which was stopped by police in a routine traffic check on State Highway 3. Mr Price drove past his stopped associate before turning around and ramming a parked police car. Assistant Commissioner Sandra Venables says it was an unexpected escalation. The staff members that were there dealt with a situation that was at the beginning just a traffic stop that escalated when Mr Price returned to the scene. Sandra Venable says a critical incident investigation is underway with police as well as an independent police conduct authority investigation. New teachers say all of their peers have been underpaid since the start of the year. They are on the pay rate for unqualified teachers. Education payroll assesses their qualifications. This woman says she is getting $300 a week less than she should be. For the first few weeks, I was okay because I thought it's only going to be, you know, temporary. But as it went on, I just really struggled to start paying for my regular things. I'm really lucky to have a support of family who have lent me money here and there and I had a little bit of savings, but now it's getting pretty dire. The Education Ministry says COVID has added to delays in putting people on the right pay rate. The Nurses Association organization will ask its members if they want to legally challenge an historic pay equity settlement. The union backed out of an agreement to ratify the deal last week, claiming the agreement is illegal as it doesn't include back pay to 2019. Its Chief Executive Paul Goulter says union members have two options to consider. Currently we're looking at moving to a vote of our members, probably the week after next, on whether or not to proceed immediately to the Employment Relations Authority to seek a determination, which would involve a ruling on our position about the back pay, or whether or not our members would prefer to skip that and move to a ratification process. The government stands by the deal and has categorically ruled out allocating any more money to it. The Automobile Association wants a regulator to monitor people sentenced to an alcohol interlock device. The device is fitted to a convicted drunk driver's vehicle and ensures only a sober person can start the car. Last year, just over 4,000 people received an interlock sentence, but the AA's research shows only two-thirds actually complied. This is because it's up to drivers to get the device installed and no one checks up on them. The AA's road safety spokesperson Dylan Thompson says it's a massive problem. That really matters because what the figures show is for each interlock we put into a car, it prevents about 100 attempts by somebody with alcohol in their system to drive a year. The system will be reviewed as part of the government's Road to Zero Safety Strategy. One of the greatest British classical composers of the last century, Harrison Birdwistle, has died at the age of 87. His major successes included the 1972 composition, The Triumph of Time. Operas, including the Mask of Orpheus and the Minotaur, sealed his reputation internationally. The BBC's switchboard, however, was jammed with complaints when one of his pieces was played during the proms, the televised concert that usually features patriotic British standards. To sport now and New Zealand squash player Joelle King has won the Manchester Open. Tournament's second seed king beat the top seat England, Sarah Jane Perry, and straight games in this morning's final. The Crusaders Captain Scott Barrett, Hurricanes Hooker Asafo Olmoa and Highlanders Loc, Josh Dixon, have all received lengthy bans following dangerous play in Super Rugby over the weekend. Ommo and Dixon have been suspended for three weeks with Barrett banned for four. The incidents all involved contact to an opposition player's head and all three players pleaded guilty. The Pulse have bounced back from their extra time loss to the southern steel with a 52-39 win over the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic last night in Rotorua. The Pulse won every quarter with a done shooting 35 goals from 37 attempts. And Olympic champion Peres and Chipscher Shear edged a thrilling sprint to the line to win the Boston Marathon while fellow Kenyon Evans Chibet comfortably won the men's race. And that's the news. Today, after one for year and afternoons with me Wallace Chapin, filling in for Jesse Mulligan, we'll be talking books with Catherine Robertson and music with Marty Jones, who's got what he thinks are some of the best songs to play if you're on a road trip these holidays. After three Whitney Goodman's on the show to talk about toxic positivity and why it's a problem. All that from 1pm on RNZ National. And now the short forecast from Met Service until midnight tonight, Northland, Auckland and Coromandel Peninsula, showers with heavy falls in possible thunderstorms, downpours possible in Northland into the afternoon. Waikato, Waitomo, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Taupo, Taupo, Taipo, and Hwanganui. Scattered light rain, but more persistent falls about Bay of Plenty, rain clearing west of Taupor this afternoon. Gispen and Hawksby, cloudy, occasional rain or drizzle. Manoa, too, to Wellington, including Widerapa, mainly fine with increasing high cloud, although more cloudy periods for Widerapa. Nelson and Bola, a few showers developing this morning. Fiordland, mostly cloudy with showers becoming isolated this morning. And in the east, from Marlborough to Southland, also Westland, mainly fine areas of low cloud this morning. Rain developing about Stewart Island this morning with cloudy periods appearing elsewhere in Southland. And for the Chatham's mostly cloudy. Looking at the main centres now, Auckland Tamaki Macauro, cloudy showers with chance of some heavy with thunderstorms possible until this evening, mainly north of the city, northeasterly, fresh and exposed places, temperature of 24.

And Dunedin, Oteeboe, fine with high cloud light winds, but northeasterly is developing along the coast this afternoon and a top temperature of 20 degrees. RNZ National, it is 8 past 6. Atamaria, you're listening to Morning Report with Susie Ferguson and Corrin Dan. Now, we begin in Ukraine where in a largely untouched western city of Leviv, missile strikes have killed at least seven people. Leviv's military commander says three military warehouses and a car garage were hit. The BBC's Dan Johnson is outside the garage. The authorities tell us that it is a tire-fitting garage, a place that looks after people's cars. They say this is not a military target whatsoever, but they have said three other military facilities were hit in this morning's air raid. It was about 10 to 8 when we heard the air raid sirens sound once again. There have been more air raids in the last few days, more alert. But then it was about 30 or 40 minutes after the sirens that I heard the sound of something like jets overhead. It's not clear if the strikes were launched from fighter jets or if there were missiles launched from outside Ukraine. But I actually saw a couple of the missiles myself streaking across the sky and then hitting buildings on the city's roof line. And then we saw the black plumes of smoke rising up. I actually counted five explosions myself, even though the city's officials are saying that there were four missile strikes. Six people have died. We're not sure if they were all here, but that number includes, city officials say one child and eight people have been wounded. But as the emergency response continues, it's possible that the number of injured or indeed dead may rise even further. And this fits a pattern of repeated attacks that we've seen on Ukrainian cities over the last three or four days, renewed Russian attacks. They said in response to Ukraine targeting villages in Russia, that's something that Ukraine denies. But what has happened here in LeViv this morning are certainly underlined to people in this city, the nature of the threat, we're hundreds of miles here from the fighting in the east. But still, it shows what the level of damage can be and the fact that people can get caught up in these attacks. There is no sign of Russian attacks easing in the eastern part of Ukraine. The BBC's Tom Bateman is in Denebro, where he said sirens have been wailing for much of the last 24 hours. There were attacks, there were strikes that what they described as railway infrastructure was destroyed in Pavlagrad, not far from here. And in another area, they said two people were injured. They didn't say what had been hit. And what we've found in the past in Denepro, when there have been missile attacks, is that trying to get access to the sites of destruction is difficult. I think that officials, Ukrainians, believe that if a lot of information is available to the Russians about where exactly their missiles are landing, it can help them to calibrate their targeting. There were reports of intense fighting in the Donbass region, too, including one report that four civilians were shot dead as they tried to flee a small township. Ukraine's armed forces command said it believed that Russia had started a new push for control of the east. Here's Tom Bateman again. So the situation is deteriorating there. I don't think it's got to the stage that everyone is expecting, which is a major Russian assault. It's really not clear when that might happen, even though we know that Russia has been moving troops and hardware into the region. And I think much of that hangs on the fate of the besieged port city of Madiupol in the southeast, because, you know, the city hasn't been captured completely by the Russians yet. There is still a holdout by possibly up to 2,000 Ukrainian forces there. So that is tying up still lots of Russian forces. But if that moment comes, that will allow the Russians to redeploy many of their troops. And you might see a far greater movement into the east. Ukraine and Russia have failed again to agree on safe escape routes for civilians trapped in besieged areas, including Mariupol. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Irina Varachuk said it was the second day in a row that no deal had been struck. The BBC's Anna Foster is in Kiev, where she said there had been further attacks. Since the sinking of the Russian flagship, the Moskva, just a few days ago, there was a feeling that Russia needed to be seen to be striking back in some way. And what better way to do that than to symbolically once again return to the capital? So over the last three days or so, we've had strikes on what we're told have been tank manufacturing facilities, places that make anti-air and anti-ship missiles, places that make ammunition. Again, seen to be from Russia a statement as much as anything else, but a way that they are reminding the residents of this city in particular that even though they might have moved their forces away, they haven't moved their attention away. That is the BBC's Anna Foster there reporting from Kyiv it is coming up towards 14 minutes past six let's go to Sweden now where there's been a fourth day of clashes sparked by the plans of a far right group to burn copies of the Quran three people are reported to have been injured after police fired warning shots at rioters and at least 17 others were arrested. The unrest began on Thursday in the city of Lynn Coping but has spread to other cities. And the BBC Charlotte Gallagher has more. This is all about an apparent burning of the Quran. The strange thing is we don't actually know if a Quran was burned. But a rally was advertised by a far-right anti-Muslim political party called Hardline in the city of Linkaping on Thursday. And once this was advertised that this was going to happen, violent riots started essentially. And then they spread across many cities in Sweden, including Stockholm and Malmo, which saw a few years ago riots connected to the burning of the Quran. So this is what it's all about. The founder of this party is a man called Rasmus Palluddin. Now he's Danish and anything usually in Scandinavia connected to this kind of thing, so the burning of the Quran, far right protests, is often connected to this man. So he was jailed in Denmark in 2018 for racism. He's tried to do burnings of Korans in other countries before, France, Belgium, for example. And one question that people are asking in Sweden today is, why was Hardline allowed permission to have a rally in Sweden in the first place? These kind of things have happened before and they've escalated, yet Hardline was allowed permission to have this event on Thursday. At the moment, it seems to be one of real just trying to control things as they spring up. So today, on Sunday, we saw things in Nortuping and Linkaping where it all first started. Norshipping, police came under attack and they fired warning shots. Three people were injured. They think by the ricochets from these warning shots. They're in hospital. They've also apparently been arrested by police. And we know that police from Stockholm have been drafted in to other cities to try and quell this violence really. We've seen police cars on fire, buses on fire, windows caved in from stones. At least nine police officers have been attacked. One had his arm broken, for example. And I think the real theory is that it'll carry on into next week as well. That is the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher reporting. It is now 16 minutes past six on morning report. Three people have died on the roads over Easter. That is considerably down on last year's toll of nine. The official holiday period ended at six this morning, with us now as the AA's spokesperson on road safety. Dylan Thompson, good morning, Dylan. Hiora, good morning. Keora, indeed. Now, this is obviously still not good news. We want zero, but it's better. What do you think we can put that down to? I think it's too early to really say there's any type of trend going on here. The sad truth is that you can have a lot of fluctuation in fatal crashes because they are, thankfully, still quite rare events. If you look at the year overall, we're actually above where we were this time last year. So we've had a good Easter and that's great. But we've had more deaths in total this year than last year, which is not where we want to be at all. And do you have any thinking on why that is? Well, we've certainly seen bounce back in driving through the COVID pandemic times, driving dropped off by sort of around 3 to 5%. So we've got more vehicles out on the roads. What we're really hoping is in the COVID pandemic times, road policing has really suffered because of the other police duties. And the AA, we're hoping we're going to see a much higher police presence coming back on the roads as we come out of the pandemic because that makes a real difference in driver behaviour and the choices people make. You think that did have an impact over this Easter that I spoke to the police last week. They were promising to be out in force. Well, I hope so is the only answer I can give because I don't know. I really hope they were out in force anecdotally. That seems to be the case. And we want to see more of that because we know it makes people kind of not take those 50-50 calls. If they're seeing a lot of police on the roads, they don't take those gambles, they don't take those chances, and then they just make some safer choices behind the wheel, and that makes a difference. Yeah, I mean, we're seeing obviously a big advertising push as well for the Zero Road Toll campaign. You know, how important are those sorts of messages? Well, we need to improve our driving culture in New Zealand. And that's not an easy thing to do. But I think a lot of the advertising and campaigns, they're all about trying to get people to change their mindset and their approach to driving. And I think we do need to do quite a bit of that because I guess it's the riskiest thing most of us do every day. And we tend to get a bit blaze and casual about it. So I think all of us, if we're honest, can actually say we could be a little bit better behind the wheel and make some safer choices at times, and we need to work on that. It's going to be a hard thing and take a long time to do, but we do need to improve it. I mean, is it some of this just down to things like luck and the weather? I mean, for large parts of the country, not all of it, it was sort of stunning weather. That helps, doesn't it? Well, strangely enough, it can be the opposite. So, obviously, when you're out driving and it's wet and bad weather conditions, that's something that you need to adjust to and it creates more risks on the road. But the flip side of that is it does tend to mean less people actually go out on the roads and more people maybe put off their driving trips. So lots of times, and I guess that's why in summer, that tends to be the season where we see the highest number of crashes, and it's because you have more traffic out on the roads and people going out. So there's a certain element of a numbers game, but the weather thing can kind of be a bit counterintuitive sometimes. Interesting that we're still seeing this trend. No tourists that are on our roads. Well, there are tourists, but not of. Interesting that we're still seeing this trend. No tourists that are on our roads. Well, there are tourists, but not of the numbers that we've seen in previous years. No, and international visitors were only ever involved in sort of about 5% or less of fatal crashes depending on the year, and they weren't the party at fault in all of those crashes either. So they only ever made up a small proportion of road deaths and the vast majority always involved local drivers. So it's no surprise to us that not having the international visitors hasn't seen a big change in the number of deaths on our roads. Dylan Thompson, thank you very much for that. That is the AA spokesperson there on road safety. It is 20 minutes past six. Well, former members of one of the country's biggest churches say it spent the money tithed from its members on grandiose services and huge fees for overseas speakers. They say the glitter and freebies are all designed to attract young people, many of whom have complained of being mistreated. John Cameron, the founding pastor of Arise, has resigned after interns claimed they were overworked and overwhelmed. John Deidine's been talking to some of them. The carefully cultivated image Arise Church portrays to the public masks a culture of mistreatment and greed. That's the damning allegation from former members of the Pentecostal congregation. A few years ago, when Ashley was a teenager, she attended a rise and thought about becoming an intern. But the price of admission to the role, $2,500, was too steep. You were also expected to commit full-time and would be left with barely any time to have actual paying work to support yourself. But interns worked long hours and rather the works, I felt sorry for them. Ashley says her first impressions of Arise were great, but she soon began to think that money was the church's main focus. Every single service, the title was intervised. They even had 18s in the foyer in a special ad that you could use. It was strewn to us each time, 10% of your earnings, as it says in the Bible. A riser's emphasis on money is echoed by other former members. A woman we're calling Harriet joined in 2007 while at university and served on the production team for a decade. She says speakers coming from as far away as the US were paid huge fees. Pastors were chauffefereur to and from services, and there was an ingrained expectation that interns would go above and beyond. He became very unhealthy and took a heavy toll on a volunteer workforce. Another former member we're calling Sandra, says she started to question the church's tithe demands after a snowboard was handed out as a gift during one service. A religious expert says young people are attracted to the bright lights of megachurches and are vulnerable to exploitation. Emeritus Professor of History at Massey University, Peter Lyonim, sees youth are no longer content singing century-old hymns and monotonous unison. He says a focus on pizzazz can lead to poor pastoral care and interns are vulnerable in many workplaces. The whole area of internship is, I think, an area where a lot of young people get exploited. Not churches are one place, law firms are another. I mean, there are plenty of places where interns are subject to really quite shocking misuse of their time and energies. An independent review into the culture of the church is due to get underway. 23 minutes past six, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Some traffic news in the South Island. DeNeden State Highway 1 is closed to traffic. This is headed south on Carlton Hill between Raisal Road and Main South Road. This is due to a crash. So do take care there. Our main stories on morning report this morning. The Prime Minister has begun her first international trade trip since the pandemic began. Hundreds of drunk drivers are getting away with never having an interlocked device fitted to their vehicles and Russian missile strikes at the western Ukrainian city of Leviv, killing at least seven. 24 past six. My business, that is to Giles Backford is in now with Gora, Gailor Giles. No, the markets, what's happening? Wall Street. Well, the main indices are all stronger, although they have spent a good part of the session in negative territory, but the past half hour they've gone into the black. Mainly it would be some solid earnings results there. Bank of America was one that came out beating forecasts. But generally the tone is cautious, expectations, of course, of firm action by the Federal Reserve to battle inflation. So Dow Jones and the S&P 500 each up about a tenth of a percent. The NASDAQ is up about a quarter of a percent at the moment. Her own top 50 index starts the new week, finally breaking a six-day losing streak, gained 17 points on Thursday, 11,892. And the New Zealand dollar, 67.2 US cents, just a little bit under the cosh, and 91.4 Australians. Now, you mean bulletin in half an hour? What's coming up? Well, we'll take a look at this week's inflation numbers and watch out for another surge. 30-year plus high, just more grist to the Reserve Bank's rate hiking mill. Commercial property developers looking to put projects on hold or scrapping them all together. And the business advisory firm, EY, sets up a new business to tackle growing challenges for the financial sector. All that, and the latest from the markets, just after 10 to 7. Keanu thanks very much. Giles Beckford there, our business editor at 25 past 6. Let's go to the rural news now with Sally Murphy in Christchurch, Otahe. Keora, good morning. Now some primary industry leaders. They are off with the Prime Minister selling New Zealand's food story in Singapore and Japan this week. That's right. They're part of the delegation travelling with Jacinda Ardern and Minister of Trade and Export Growth Damien O'Connor on the trade mission to the two countries. 13 business leaders, including representatives from Fontera, Zesbury and Meat Company Ansco Foods, are heading along. Grant Ferry, the chief executive of the Food Bowl, is also on the trip. The Food Bowl is a government-funded food processing facility, which enables companies to test product innovations. Mr. Veri says New Zealand has a great food story which he's keen to promote. It's definitely the reason for my attendance on this trip is to put some rubber on the road for industry. We want to get outcomes. We have good other departmental agencies inside New Zealand that can provide those opportunities and we need to leverage those more for industry and we need to be able to collaborate stronger. It's a large part of what we want to do here at the food bowl as part of the New Zealand Food Innovation Network is to make sure we collaborate strongly and then produce those opportunities back to industry. So absolutely getting high-value product into market and to Singapore and Japan are key goals for us. That's Grant Ferry. And the Minister for Trade and Export Growth, Damien O'Connor says Japan is our fourth largest trading partner and Singapore is the fifth with two-way trade with the countries accounting for billions of dollars. He says they buy a lot of dairy, meat and horticulture products, so the government's keen to gain further access and to create better connections for exporters. Yes, we'll hear from our deputy political editor who is on that trip in about half an hour or so. And now, the number of tamarillo growers is actually dropping year on year. What's going on here? Yeah, this is because the sector is grappling with tomato potato sillet, the bug, also known as TPP, can prevent fruit from forming on plants and reduce yields. It's cost tomato and potato growers tens of millions of dollars each year. Robin Wickedon, chairperson of the Tamarillo Growers Association, says since the first case of TPP was found here in 2008, the situation has only got worse. So our yields have gone down and our grown numbers have gone down. So if I look at 2008, we had 175 growers. That was our last big year of yield. So we had 971 tonnes that year. 2014, we'd had the spray program in place for about a year by then. We're at 55 growers and 438 tonnes. And then last year, we had 25 growers and we were at 414 tonnes. Ms Wickedon says the bug has caused huge damage to her own orchard in Northland. 60% of her trees didn't produce fruit last year. She says recent summers have been hotter and winters have been warmer, which she thinks is leading to higher populations of tomato potato silud. She says more growers have signalled they are getting out of the business at the end of this season. We're really concerned that we're going to lose tamarolos off the, you know, out of the New Zealand winter fruit bowl, basically, because it's just becoming so difficult to grow them. You know, the trees are a bit temperamental anyway. They don't like frost, They don't like wind. They don't like wet feet. So, and to have Silud and Liberia Bacta on top of that is quite disheartening. And Robin Wickedon has recently covered her one hectare orchard with netting to see if that prevents damage caused by tomato potato silud. And that's the rural news. Thank you very much, Sally Murphy. It is 29 minutes past six. Let's have a little look at your weather this morning. There's rain or showers with possible thunderstorms for the north of the North Island. Pretty much fine elsewhere though. Auckland's still pretty warm, 24 degrees today. Tauranga and Hamilton, 21, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, all making it into the 20s with 20 as well. The warmest place at the moment is Kaitaya, which is already on 20.9 degrees. Must be a nice morning up there. And the coldest place is Oamuru on just 0.2 degrees. Omarama. I say, yep. Put me right, thank you. On to 0, 0,0, but it's pretty cold. That's quite a contrast, isn't it? Between the top and the bottom there? It sure is. Coming up before 7 on Morning reports, Fai Aki, we speak to Export New Zealand about the Prime Minister's first trade mission in two years. Hundreds, possibly thousands of new teachers, are being underpaid hundreds of dollars each week. As it went on, I just really struggled to start paying for my regular things. I had a little bit of savings, but now it's getting pretty dire. And Prince Harry and his wife, Megan, visit the Queen in a surprise visit to the UK. Kurtata Tawamu. Now news headlines in Anna Thomas. A Taranaki community leader says the shooting of a man by police near New Plymouth has opened old wounds of the past police shootings in the region. 22-year-old Chaos Price was shot on Saturday night after he rammed a police car on State Highway 3. Five people have been shot by police in Taranaki in the last 22 years, including Stephen Wallace in Wightara in 2000. New Plymouth City Councillor Dinny Moyahu says everyone is in shock and grieving. He says, while the shooting might be a symptom of a wider problem, the community should not speculate about what happened until the investigation is complete. The Prime Minister has acknowledged she could catch COVID-19 overseas and have to isolate there, but says that's a risk worth taking. Jacinda Ardurn has begun a six-day trip to Singapore and Japan in her first international endeavour for more than two years. She arrived in Singapore late last night. Mrs Ardern says the delegation is taking precautions to avoid catching COVID-19 as much as possible. I'm not anxious about it. It's just a reality of travel. For me, though, it's about making sure that we just build that in into our calculation of when to go and ensure that, you know, as much as possible if it does happen, we've planned for that and it doesn't have as too many negative consequences. Jacinda Arden will sit down with her Singaporean counterpart later today. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol says about 40,000 civilians have been forcibly moved to Russia or Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine. Vardim Mabwechenko says the numbers were verified by the city's municipal register. Russia has denied targeting civilians in Ukraine. Meanwhile, two British men captured by Russian forces while fighting for Ukraine have appeared on state television in Russia. The BBC's Andrew Plant reports. In a video shown on Russian state TV, Sean Pinner and Aden Aslin asked for Boris Johnson to help bring them home. It's not clear if they were speaking under duress. They asked to be swapped for a pro-Russian politician, Victor Medvedevich. The close ally of Vladimir Putin is currently being held by Ukrainian authorities. In a statement released through the Foreign Office, Sean Pinner's family say he was in the British military for many years before moving to Ukraine in 2018 and serving as a Marine in the Ukrainian army. He and Mr. Aslin were both fighting with Ukrainian Marines in the city of Maripol before they were captured. About 2,500 fewer people had operations in Auckland's hospitals in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year. It's a measure of the impact the Omicron outbreak had on patients as hospitals drastically scaled back services. Only the most urgent surgery was done, as theatres were shut down because they were needed for space or the staff were needed to help elsewhere. Former members of one of the country's biggest churches say Arise pressured them for donations to pay for its grandiose events. John Cameron, the founding pastor of Arise, has resigned after allegations that interns were mistreated. Former member Ashley says the carefully cultivated image Arise Church portrayed to the public masked a culture of greed. She describes it as having a very cult-like following. Ashley says she looked into being an intern before discovering this would cost her $2,000 and essentially all her free time. The Automobile Association wants a regulator to monitor people sentenced to an alcohol interlocked device. The device is fitted to a convicted drunk driver's vehicle and ensures only a sober person can start the car. Last year, just over 4,000 people received an interlock sentence, but the AA's research shows only two-thirds actually complied. This is because it's up to drivers to get the device installed and no one checks up on them. And that's the news. My question to you is, you're waiting to someone, they're not there in 10 minutes, what amount of time do you give someone, do you give them 5 minutes? Do you give them 10 minutes? Or do you give them just a little bit after 10 minutes, say 12? Or do you actually, you know what? Half an hour, no worries. When we used to do the panel from the studio, it was always you that would be 15 minutes early. You were the only one. The panel with me, Wallace Chapman, every afternoon from 345 on RNZ National. And now looking at the MetService regional forecast. First, the situation, a ridge sits over most of the South Island today, while several fronts associated with a low in the Tasman Sea move over the North Island, and another front affects the far south. So here are the regional forecasts until midnight tonight. Northland, Auckland and Coramandal Peninsula, cloudy with showers, some heavy with possible thunderstorms until this evening, localized downpours possible in Northland into the afternoon. Northeasteries, fresh and exposed places. Wakato, Waitomo, Bay of Plenty, Rotorua, Taranaki, Taupor, Hwanganui and Tahape, scattered light rain, but more persistent falls about the Bay of Plenty, rain clearing in the west of Taupor this afternoon, but remaining mostly cloudy, northeasterlies. Gisbon and Hawks Bay, cloudy, scattered rain or drizzle, clearing in Hawks Bay this afternoon, northeast lease. Manua, two, Hordofenoa, Karpiti Coast, Wellington and Widerapa, including the Taradoa District. Fine with increasing higher cloud and light winds, but more cloudy periods for Widerapa and the Taduwa District with Northeasterly's there. Nelson and Bulla, cloud, increasing this morning with a few showers developing towards midday. Fjordland, mostly cloudy with showers becoming isolated this morning in Northerlees. Marlborough, Canterbury, Otago, Southland and Westland, mainly fine, but areas of low cloud this morning rain developing about Stuart Island this morning with cloudy periods developing elsewhere in Southland. Winds mainly light, but northerly breezes in Southland and Cluther. And for the Chatham Islands, mostly pouty with northerlies. The outlook for all of New Zealand until midnight tomorrow for the North Island, rain or showers for most most, but only possible shouts in the south and east. For the South Island rain in the west and north with heavy falls developing, increasing cloud elsewhere with late rain in the far south. And for the Chatham's cloudy periods, with strengthening northerleys. It is 23 minutes to 7. And this is morning report. Time to catch up on the world of sport now with our rugby reporter. Joe Porter. Good morning, Joe. Kilda. Morena. Quite a bit to get through, actually, on rugby. Let's start with a Silver Lake deal. I thought this was all signed, sealed and delivered, but it's not there yet. Yeah, didn't we all. But apparently the provincial unions aren't completely happy with the proposed deal, which was supposed to be ratified at one of their annual general meetings coming up shortly. But that's been delayed. The provincial unions want more information about not the upfront amount of cash they'll receive. They're happy with that, but what they'll receive long-term-wise in terms of any gains and revenue that New Zealand rugby make well with this deal with Silver Lake. So certainly a couple of sort of key things from the provinces. They want to have sort of, I guess, a level playing field with the Players Association too. So they want an independent representative on the board of this commercial co entity that will be set up by Silver Lake and New Zealand Rugby to look after the revenue. The Players Association have someone on that board so that provinces want someone on the board too. And they essentially want to see in the future that the chunk of the revenue they get is considered fair and will ensure that the grassroots and community game is protected in the future possible that they see that the players getting a larger chunk of that future revenue. And they'd like to see that sort of that figure come down into a fair amount split between the players and the provincial union. So a little bit of a battle going on here, it would seem still, between the Players Association and the provincial unions. And New Zealand Rugby Silver Lake Deal has had another hurdle in the road, another snag. Well, that's the last thing that the rugby union wants after. What are we? How are we describing what has gone on with the Black Ferns now that Coach Glenn Moore has stepped down? I mean, this seems pretty extraordinary after they basically backed him after they're a critical review, and then he resigns a few days later. It has been an extraordinary turn of events. You thought that once he'd survived the review and obviously survived NDA giving him the acts, he would probably have wanted to continue on, make amends it, and lead this team through to the World Cup like he'd always planned on doing with, of course, Wayne Smith and Graham Henry coming on board to help. But no, it seems that he's decided that the ongoing distraction of the review, and I guess him retaining his role as the head coach, would have just caused too many distractions and disruptions for the Black Friends heading towards this World Cup, which isn't too far away starting in October. I imagine there would have been too many questions around his involvement. He's decided it's best to step down and let them focus on the task ahead. But obviously, on his way out, he's fired a couple of shots saying, you know, that the social media posts by that sort of sparked this review in a way by Te Kudha Aiding Amati, he's described her comments as misleading out of context and not necessarily true. So he's fired a couple of shots on his own on his way out, saying that while he's stepping down because he thinks it's in the Blackfings' best interest to do so, some of the things that have been said about him aren't necessarily true. And he regrets the damage that it's done to both him and his family's mental health as well. So it's taking a toll. And look, to be honest, I really do feel like it's quite a big move from Glenmore because NZR, in all reality, probably couldn't have sacked him in many ways. He had to step down rather than them giving him the push because the review, whilst not targeting Glenmore specifically in many instances, I think his name was only mentioned one or two times, it did repeatedly say that New Zealand rugby had failed to set the black ferns up and their high performance program. And so essentially, they'd really given Glenn Moore nothing to work with and they'd failed him in the first instance before it even got there. So he could have argued that while there were failings within his management and his coaching group, ultimately, NZR were the ones who had the blame pinned on them for not setting him up and not giving them enough money, resource and support to make that team work well. So it is an interesting development and whether or not it causes more disruptions or whether or not it will, as well more hopes, lead to the black friends now being able to focus more intently on that goal of winning the World Cup remains to be seen. Indeed. All righty, thank you very much for that. That is our rugby reporter. Joe Porter. It is 19 minutes to 7. The Prime Minister will soon be starting her first full day of work away from New Zealand in more than two years. Jacinda Ardairn is in Singapore until Wednesday with trade and business leaders and then travels on to Japan to spread the economic word that the country is open for business and tourists. Boosting exports is a critical part of that. Someone who's watching that aspect of the trip closely is our next guest, Catherine Beard, executive director of Export New Zealand. Kiyora. Good morning. So for Singapore and Japan, it's first on the list. Why is this specifically important for exporters here? Look, it's just a really great signal to show the world that New Zealand's open for business and exporters are able to travel again. You know, these are really important relationships. These two countries are very close friends of New Zealand. And often Singapore is one of the first places that are small to medium exporter will kind of dip their toll in the water if they are looking to export into Asia. So, you know, it's just really good to put these countries on the map and get everybody talking about and I'm focused on them. Is it largely symbolic then, or do you expect some specific things to come out of this trip? Look, they're a bit of both. There's a bit of both. There's a lot of geopolitics involved in making these trips and having personal relationships at the prime ministerial level, so that's hugely important. You know, it's not a big delegation. It'll be our bigger companies. I'm sure that they will find some deals to ink and some ribbons to cut. I mean, those are usually part of trade missions. But they're not, you know, they're not all about just going to sell stuff. They're a lot about relationships. And that relationship, is this really marking a reset for New Zealand and showing that New Zealand is coming out of that sort of COVID lockdown of the borders? Oh, look, absolutely, you know, I think it hasn't gone unnoticed that we have New Zealand is coming out of that sort of COVID lockdown of the borders? Oh, look, absolutely, you know, I think it hasn't gone unnoticed that we have been come a bit of a hermit kingdom. I mean, our exporters were always able to get out of the country, but they had no certainty have been able to get back in. And that sort of damaged the ability to get in all sorts of people to fix plant and equipment. But also if you were investing in New Zealand, you're an international company invested here. That made things difficult as well. So, yeah, I mean, it's a very good signal that we're trying to get on with life and back to some normality. Have we really been a hermit kingdom? You know, exports presumably have still been going over the border for the last two years. Yeah, and that just shows how important our food and beverage exports are because we've been able to put those in containers essentially and get them away on ships, which has been a bit fraught because of supply chain issues. But just that goods export has continued to flow, and particularly the big commodity exporters, so that just shows how important that is to our economy. But actually for the smaller tech and IT and services exporters, it's actually been really difficult. They need to be in market. They need to be at trade shows. They need to be in market, they need to be at trade shows, they need to be filling that pipeline of new work, and according to some data I've seen, they've actually found that pretty hard through the last two years. Thank you very much for your time. Catherine Beard, their executive director at Export New Zealand. It is quarter to seven. Hundreds, possibly thousands of new teachers are being underpaid by up to $300 a week. This woman says she's being paid about $300 a week less than she should be. For the first few weeks, I was okay because I thought it's only going to be, you know, temporary. But as it went on, I just really struggled to start paying for my regular things. I'm really lucky to have a support of family who've lent me money here and there and I had a little bit of savings, but now it's getting pretty dire. Now it happens at the start of every year when new teachers or their schools failed to provide correct paperwork to the Education Ministry, but it's now taking months to fix because of COVID. The Secondary Principles Association, Vaughan QIA, says this year's delays are so bad it has had to raise the problem with the ministry. There might be some administrative reasons why your first payroll is not quite right because you're onboarding and getting it right. But for it to roll into multiple payroll periods, that does indicate that there's an issue. Post-primary Teachers Association, President Melanie Weber, joins us now. Good morning. Morning. Aramari, now this issue, I'm sort of getting ghosts of Nova Pay coming back into my mind, but that's all changed since then, hasn't a few years back. So why is this happening? Nova Pay is not entirely fixed. It's functioning now, but it's still not a brilliant beast. So you've got all those complications of that going on. But as you mentioned, you've got those additional complications going on at a school level. So this is an ongoing problem, and it's been made worse by COVID, which means both at the school end and the ministry end, things are taking longer. So if people just, is this just a case of people not putting in their paperwork soon enough and if they did that soon enough and straight away at the beginning of the year there wouldn't be a problem, or is it just a backlog once it gets there? There's a backlog once it gets there. And when I first started teaching, I know this was happening to people. So it's been going on for a long time. One of the ways that they could resolve this is by not starting teachers right at the... So what happens is they're paying them at the very bottom of the untrained teacher scale. There are very, very few people we have going into teaching who are at the very bottom of the untrained teaching scale. So people like the young woman you were talking to earlier, she more than likely has done her teacher training is qualified. And for secondary teachers, they'll also have a degree. So they should be starting far higher up. So if they started them at that higher point and then assessed, people wouldn't be struggling to get by on these very, very low salaries. But that would cost more, right, because you would still end up paying those untrained teachers a higher wage for some period of time? Yes, but you would be able to resolve that later, and that would make more sense for the majority of people if you just started everyone out slightly higher. I mean, is it a resourcing issue at the Ministry of Education? Have they not got the staff because of COVID to process this? Like everywhere, they have had staff off, which has held this up, and because there is the other place where it can get held up, which is at the school level, it's made it complicated for everyone. But the key issue is that people shouldn't be being started at the very bottom of the untrained scale. Even if they had something where the school estimated where they believed that person to be, and then it was adjusted through. But this $300 a week shortfall in people's salaries at a time when people are coming out of being students, so they've often had to move into new flats, and they're having to think about things like new wardrobes for teaching. You can't wear your student wardrobe to your first grown-up job. So there are all these additional expenses that these people have, which is making it even harder. They will be backpaid, presumably? They will be back paid, but when they're back paid, that initially gets a big dollop of tax comes off at, which they get back at the end of the year, but they need that money then. Indeed they do. Thank you very much for that. Melanie Weber, Kejolra, the Post-Primary Teachers Association president with some glitches for new teachers coming into the system, not getting as much pay as they should be getting due to delays. It is 11 minutes to 7. Well, Britain's Prince Harry and his wife, Megan, have recently stopped by the UK and met with the Queen for an unexpected visit. The couple made the stop on their way to the Invictus Games in the Netherlands, which opened on Friday. It's the first time Megan has returned to the UK since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex resigned from Royal Duties in early 2020. Royal Commentator Dickie Arbiter is with us. Kiyora, Dickie, thanks for being with us this morning on RNZ. How significant was this visit coming shrouded in secrecy? Well, a visit was a surprise and I have asked the question, if they weren't going to the Invictus Games, would they have come to London? It's still a big question mark. They were on their way to the Invictus Games and it would have been churlish not to stop in London for Harry not to see his dad and to not see his grandmother. So it was perhaps a given that they were going to the Victor's Games. Indeed, but Prince Harry recently in the headlines because of this court situation, challenging the home office because he's not covered by security. Is that why it was so fleeting a visit? And indeed, is there any clarity about whether there'll be any return? Well, there's no clarity whether there'll be a return and it does put a bit of a mockery on his supposed claim that England is not safe. You go to Windsor Castle, it's saturated with security. He's living, he's got his home at Frogmore Cottage. The Queen is well protected. The castle grounds are well protected. The public are not allowed in droves when there is a special service on at St. George's Chapel. So there wasn't a question about security coming into Windsor. But he is putting into question the fact that he's not afforded security. Well, he's no longer a working royal and therefore he's not afforded security. Well, he's no longer a working royal, and therefore he's not entitled to security, suggesting that he would pay for it is something that the metropolitan police don't do. They don't offer security on demand and for payment. That's not their job. Indeed, of course, people will be now looking towards the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June. And questions must be being raised now about whether Harry and Megan will return for that, of course, such a high profile event coming up. Well, it is a high profile event and there are a lot of commentators saying preferably not come back to the UK because the focus of attention will be on them and there is only one party girl in platinum jubilee there is only one star and that is the queen if they come then all focus of attention will be on them and that is the wrong message to send out now of the queen herself uh not attending easter sund Sunday's service or the Mondi service, which has been, of course, a real mainstay of her reign. And what sort of health is she? Well, it's an interesting one that you ask there. Her mind is razor sharp. She misses nothing. She continues doing her red boxes, which are official papers on a daily basis. She continues doing some face-to-face audiences, a lot of Zoom audiences, but it's the physical aspect of it that's not actually happening. She is frail by her own admission. I think there is a mobility issue. And up until the Thanksgiving service, Buckingham Palace was saying, well, she might attend. Indeed, she did attend. But they're now saying that they won't say whether she will attend or not until the day, and on the day itself, if she's going to attend, they will say so. But they're not going to put people's expectations high. And I think it's wrong to put people's expectations high. I think quite it's wrong to put people's expectations high. I think quite frankly, a lot of people are hoping, not just Buckingham Palace, but generally people in the UK, that she holds her energy in reserves and appears at major platinum jubilee events, namely trooping the colour on the 2nd of June, Thanksgiving service on the 3rd of June, and perhaps one or two other events. But the two I mention are key to the platinum jubilee, and it would be very sad if she wasn't there. And I suppose it's a case of sort of holding fire on your energy reserves for those particular events. They're not until June, and we're only sort of halfway through April, so it remains to be seen. Now, Mehi, thank you very much for your time. That's Dickie Arbiter, Royal Commentator at 6 to 7. The papers in New Zealand herald, a woman claiming to be the friend of the man shot by police in New Plymouth on Saturday, says he told her the morning before he died that he wanted to make changes to his life. Waukeldo Times has a story on a legal battle between former Hamilton Merrill candidate and adult entertainment site only fans performer Lisa Lewis and her neighbours the Hamilton Cosmopolitan Club. Wellington bursts into life is the headline on the Dominion Post, which has a story on the capital's first few days at the Orange setting. And the press also leading with businesses Easter boost thanks to the move to orange. The Atago Daily Times University of Otago student, Callum Bindon, has been fighting two parallel battles, one against spiders infesting his flat, and another against thieves, nicking part of the sign he has erected out the front that declares how many days he has been Araknid free. Spider-Man, very good. Let's check in on the travel news this morning. Tamaki Makara, crash blocking one lane, headed north on State Highway 20 near Mangari Bridge and down to Dan Eden. A crash has closed State Highway 1, headed south on Carlton Hill between Ryslaw Road and Main South Road. Now on to business news, Charles Beckford. Kjora. Thank you, Susie Atomare. In the business news this morning, brace yourself for 7% inflation, property developers feeding the pinch and the latest from the financial markets. We'll get set for a surge in inflation, a further surge, in fact, in big headlines about 30-year high cost pressures, all of which, of course, will carry the word crisis. Inflation for the first three months of the year will be released on Thursday. It's expected to be an annual rate of more than 7% the highest since June 1990. ASB is picking a quarterly rise of 2.2%. That would take the end rate to 7.3%, driven by higher fuel and food prices and the usual costs of running and building a house. But senior economist Mark Smith says probably more important than the actual number is how long inflation of this strength will hang around for. Now, it's really going to come down to those domestic inflation drivers that will drive the persistence in inflation, and that's the area that the Reserve Bank will be concerned about. Now, we see quite widespread capacity pressures in the economy, we see wages picking up as well, so those domestic inflation drivers will have a bit more impetus to run through this year, and that's really what the reason behind a 6% inflation expectation for this year. Mark Smith says inflation of this ferocacy probably means another 50 basis point rise by the Reserve Bank in May and steady rises to around 3% in the cash rate by the end of the year. The commercial property developer expects more office buildings will be sold in coming months as firms struggle to lease space and meet rising construction costs. Listed property concern Asset Plus has just sold an office building in central Auckland for $65 million, citing leasing challenges and difficulties in funding the development. Company's manager Mark Francis says he expects more firms to follow suit as the operating environment has significantly changed since in the past two years. COVID, as we all know, has got a major impact on the office sector. It does probably feel like it turned a corner for the better, but, you know, still slow. Corporates are very slow in making decisions, and, you know, there's probably still a net reduction going on. So, yeah, a very different environment to what it was when we sort of embarked on this project. Marker says the company is still a great believer in the office space, but it made sense to sell this particular asset to free up cash. It's turned to financial markets now. Wall Street stronger in the past hour or so. Although wholesale interest rates hit three-year highs on expectations of aggressive tightening in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, Dar Jones Industrial Average is currently up just under 50 points, that's about a tenth of a percent, the S&P 500 up 0.2 percent, and the NASDAQ is up 0.1%. Our own top 50 index starts the morning at the new week at 11,892, after it finally broke a six-day losing street gaining 17 points on Thursday. New Zealand dollar 67.2 US cents, 91.4 Australian, and that's close to an 18-month low. 51.7 British Pence, 0.624 euro, 85.4 Japanese yen and 4.29 yuan.

Corey Markle. RNZ National. Thank you, Kakaan Dantana, it is Ratu Tuesday, April the 19th. Top stories this morning. Fai Akeene, acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson, discusses Jacinda Adirne's first international trade trip in two years. Hundreds of drink drivers are getting away with never having an interlock device fitted to their vehicles. Also on morning reports, several Ukrainians are killed in a Russian missile strike on Maviv. Yet again, hundreds have thought thousands of new teachers are being underpaid. And you'll wear the rain or showers with possible thunderstorms for the north of the North Island, mainly final. The Prime Elseway. The Prime Minister has arrived in Singapore, beginning her first international mission RNZ News at 7 o'clock, Meng, A bit of Bidu Koriro, Anna Thomas Tene. The Prime Minister has arrived in Singapore beginning her first international mission in more than two years. She'll be officially welcome to the country this afternoon. Our Deputy Political Editor, Craig McCannock, is on the trip. All those travelling with the Prime Minister were tested for COVID-19 on arrival in Singapore last night. The delegation had already been tested before leaving New Zealand and will also administer daily rapid antigen tests. This speaks to the reality of travel during a pandemic and the strict requirements for crossing borders. Mazardun has a busy schedule today, including a sit-down and then media conference with her Singaporean counterpart, Li Sien-Long. They're likely to discuss trade and regional security as China continues to test its influence in the Pacific. Ukrainian officials say Russian bombardment of several cities across the country has killed at least nine people. Seven people have died after multiple missiles hit the western city of Leviv, which has, until now, largely, escaped the attacks. The civilians live close to military warehouses that were hit. It was a big boom, and the house was shaken. I thought that we were falling. There was a first strike, and then a big boom, and then the second one was weaker. Almost immediately, one after another. I did not see fire nearby. It was just later that I learned that this site was hit. I was sleeping and as soon as I heard the explosion, I went down to the shelter. Then I heard more explosions, four or five in a row. Two people have also been killed after shelling in the northern city of Kharkiv. Ukraine has called for Russia to facilitate a humanitarian corridor for evacuees from the besiege port of Mariupol and the steel plant, that is the city's last significant area of Ukrainian resistance. Deputy Prime Minister Rina Wreschuk says an urgent corridor is needed for at least 1,000 civilians, mostly women with children and the elderly hiding in bunkers in the Azov-style plant fighters there earlier rejected a Russian surrender order. Hundreds of drunk drivers who receive an interlock sentence are getting away with never having the device fitted to their vehicle. And thousands more who are eligible are not getting the mandatory sentence. Emma Hatton reports. A driver must blow into the interlock device to prove they are sober before their vehicle will start. It's up to the drivers to get the device installed, and the Automobile Association says only two-thirds of those sentenced get this done. EAA wants a regulator to take charge of following up those who are sentenced, saying it would stop tens of thousands of drunk drives each year. Its research shows that last year just over 4,000 people received an alcohol interlock sentence. That's about half the number whose driving offences mean they should get the sentence. A Taranaki community leader says the killing of a man by police near New Plymouth has opened old wounds of past police shootings in the region. 22-year-old Chaos Price was shot on Saturday night after he rammed a police car on State Highway 3. Five people have been shot by police in Taranaki in the last 22 years, including Stephen Wallace in Waitara in 2000. New Plymouth City Council, Denny Moyahu, says everybody's in shock. Maybe it's a symptom of a wider problem. I'm not too sure. I know that emotions are high, and I know that Fano are grieving. But more importantly, when we start to assume or speculate, it could be the undoing. So patience is required. And police assistant commissioner, Sandra Venables, says the death of chaos price was a tragic outcome. The Easter road toll might be down this year but the overall picture is worse. Four people died on the roads over Easter which is down on last year's toll of nine. The latest was a single vehicle crash in Dunedin on the southern motorway just after 9 o'clock last night. Police say the sole occupant died said the scene. The official holiday period ended at 6 this morning. A.A. Road Safety spokesperson Dylan Thompson told morning report it's too early to point to any sort of trend. If you look at the year overall, we're actually above where we were this time last year, so we've had a good Easter and that's great, but we've had more deaths in total this year than last year, which is not where we were this time last year. So we've had a good Easter and that's great. But we've had more deaths in total this year than last year, which is not where we want to be at all. Dylan Thompson hopes road policing will increase. The Chief Executive of Mangani Budgeting Service has resigned ahead of an inquiry into allegations former staff have made against him. Darrell Evans's resignation comes after RNZ put detailed allegations made by six former staff about his management style to him and to the board of the budgeting service, chaired by former lawyer Alistair Hall. Darrell Evans refused to respond to the allegations, but Mr. Hall says Mr Evans has now stepped down as chief executive because of poor health. Alistair Hall says the charity had appointed QC Simon Mount to oversee the inquiry. Many new teachers are being underpaid by hundreds of dollars a week. They're frustrated by the payroll system problems which have been going on since the start of the year. Our education correspondent John Gerritson reports. The teachers are being paid as if they're untrained, while education payroll sorts through the paperwork that proves their qualifications. Teachers say that's taking months, and in the meantime, they're being paid $2 to $300 a week less than they should be. Those spoken to by RNZ say the problem is creating financial stress, and it's affecting every new teacher they know. The Education Ministry says it's trying to clear the backlog. It says a lot of applications need further information and COVID has added to delays. To Sport Now and Joelle King struggled to hold back tears after winning her second Manchester Open squash title. The New Zealand second seed beat tournament top seed England's Sarah Jane Perry in this morning's final. I'm actually quite emotional because it's... Sorry. You know, it's been a long time since I've won an event. I've been through a lot of downs. So to be at this point, I mean so much. And it's King's 14th Squash World Tour title. The Crusaders Captain Scott Barrett Hurricanes Hooker Asafu Almour and Highlanders Locke Josh Dixon have all copped bands for making contact with an opponent's head in the last round of Super Rugby. Almour and Dixon have been suspended for three weeks with Barrett banned for four. The Pulse speak the magic 52-39 and their A&Z netball clash last night in Rotorua. And Kenyans have dominated the Boston Marathon with Olympic champion, Pyrriss Gibchir, winning with women's race, and Evans Chippet winning the men's. And that's the news. Tis the season for Hot Cross Buns. I'm not the biggest Hot Cross Bun fan. I think you can get a far better Easter treat, cream eggs and the like. I guess I have to. All right, fine. Yeah, I'll have some as well. Cheers. I like the ones that are inside and a soft all around the outside. It was a lot bigger than this when it started out, but I've nibbled around the edges. And it's as dense as all hell. If I drop this on my foot I could have in this show. Are they delicious? I want a straight answer. They are delicious but I reckon if you complete one you can't fit anything else in this time. Checkpoint with me Lisa Owen. Five o'clock weekday evenings on RNZ National.

And you're listening to Morning Report with Corundan and Susie Ferguson. Well, expectations are high for the government to deliver this week, as the Prime Minister leads her first trade trip abroad in more than two years. Closer to home, expectations aren't the only thing rising. Mortgage interest rates are two. They've just hit 6% for four-year fixed terms, with us now a finance minister and acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson, Kjora. Atmarie. Let's talk about this trade mission. How important is it? Oh, it's very significant. I mean, obviously, it's the first major trip overseas for the Prime Minister since COVID began. And in Singapore and Japan, we've got our fourth and fifth biggest trading partners. And so there's a real opportunity here not only to talk trade, but also to talk tourism. Prime Minister is accompanied by a number of people from different sectors, food, dairy, technology, tourism, energy. And so this is a great opportunity to get out there and sell New Zealand. And what concrete might come from it? Yeah, look, I think a big part of this is making sure that we develop up those tourism markets, get people coming back into New Zealand, so there's a promotional aspect to it. But for example, in Japan, we want to pursue further agreements around renewable energy. There's already cooperation there between Japanese companies and New Zealand companies in areas like hydrogen. We think there's a real opportunity for us to partner with a very large market there around how those technologies develop. Certainly within the food and beverage space, there's huge opportunities for New Zealand. But ultimately, this is the beginning of a number of visits and trips that the Prime Minister and ministers will make as we reconnect with the world and a great opportunity to promote New Zealand. When you say it's the opportunity to reconnect the world, we were talking earlier with Catherine Beard from Export New Zealand. She referred to New Zealand as having a hermit kingdom over the last two years. Is that fair? Because I guess while goods have still been going across the border, it's been very hard for a lot of people who run more service-based IT, for example, type businesses, been very hard for them to do the work they've been wanting to. I certainly don't agree with that phrasing. I think most New Zealanders will be aware that the border played a very important part in keeping New Zealanders safe and making sure that, you know, not only did we have good health outcomes, but the economy is also done well as well through this time. We've had over 5%. Annual average growth, we've got unemployment down at 3.2%. The export sector, in fact, did a huge part of the heavy lifting through COVID, and the government supported that with the air freight connectivity scheme and other supports. Yes, undoubtedly it's been hard for people who haven't been able to be in market. They now have that opportunity, and that's exactly why these kinds of visits matter. On the economy, inflation numbers out on Thursday, are you anticipating it hitting 7%? I tend not predict these things because it's a bit dangerous for the Minister of Finance to do that, but certainly commentators right across the spectrum are aware that inflation hasn't peaked yet. Initially a number of commentators said it would be in the first quarter, which is what these numbers will be about. Others have now said it might be the second quarter. So I certainly expect that it will be rising, as it is right around the world. Indeed, but for New Zealand, how long are you anticipating this inflation staying at this kind of white-hot level? Yeah, well, bear in mind this is an annual figure, and so what that means is that we start dropping out some of the lower quarters from the previous year, so it will keep rising. We know that, that's what commentators tell us. The amount that it rises by is obviously what everyone's debating, with the cut that we made to the field excise duty and road user charges. Some people saw that that would keep inflation a little bit in check. This is, you know, a global phenomenon. It's driven by supply chain constraints, the impacts of COVID, the war in Ukraine. Everywhere around the world, we're seeing this. The UK and the US are up over 8% now. So this is something that the whole world's dealing with. Indeed, but the rising cost of living, the rising cost of living here, a phenomenon, you see. Is it also a crisis? Well, for some people it is, absolutely. And, you know, for certain households really affected by these costs. And the prices of the things that they use a lot, be it at petrol or be it food, it's definitely that. That's why we moved on the 1st of April with that very substantial package to support low and middle-income households. It's why we made the 25 cent cut and the fuel exposed duty to try to release some of that pressure. And is this it? Is this as good as it gets or is there more coming to help households? Because, for example, could GST come off some food items? Well, we won't be doing that. I think we've covered that ground many times. What will you be doing? If we start getting and cutting GST on particular food items, it becomes a very difficult definitional issue. We'll always look to see how we can support families, and we do that through our system with working for families, and the changes on the 1st of April were substantial. First of May, we see the winter energy payment come into force for those on the lowest incomes and super-inuitants. So we'll always look to see what we can do. But I acknowledge this is a challenging time for many people, but it's hard to come through a one-in-100-year economic shock caused by COVID without some impacts. Indeed, but how are people meant to put food on the table and put clothes on their children's backs? Is there more coming in the budgets in May that will help people? I just, I don't think we can go past the fact that on the 1st of April, we saw significant income increases for people, not only for those on-income support, but those in receipt of the family tax credit. We've also seen, you know, $12 to $15 a week, people better off as a result of the fuel excise duty cut. So we've made some significant changes. We'll always continue to see if there's more that we can do. But we definitely recognise that those on low and middle incomes are the people most affected. That's why we've targeted our support there rather than others who might want our untargeted tax cuts. So $12 to $15 a week, which might buy you what, an extra cauliflower by some prices, that's not really going to cut it, is it? So are you saying that there's no more coming in the budget? Well, I never announced a budget before budget days. No, but people are desperate, Mr Robertson, and I think people need to know whether there's some help coming down the track. As I said, I think the significant support that we provided on the 1st of April is making a big difference in those low and middle income households. And with respect, I also think $12 to $15 a week, Alfie Petrol bill also makes a big difference in those low and middle income households. And we've got the winter energy payment starting on the 1st of May. We're doing a significant amount to support New Zealanders through this and we'll always look for further ways that we can do that. I appreciate your time this morning. Acting Prime Minister, of course also Finance Minister Grant Robertson there, Namihi. Thank you for your time on morning report. It is now 16 past 7. In Ukraine, missile strikes have killed at least seven people in the largely untouched western city of Leviv. LeViv's military commander says three military warehouses and a car garage were hit. The BBC's Dan Johnson gave this update from outside the garage. We've heard from local residents here that they heard two explosions. They think two missiles hit this garage. But the word from local authorities is that this is no sort of military target. There are teams there just trying to clear up the aftermath of this attack. When we arrived, the fire service was still here, putting out quite an intense blaze in that building. And we know that at least four people died here. I've just been talking to the mother of one of them, a 26-year-old called Yuri, who she said was about to have his birthday, was about to get married this summer, and lost his life this morning, just having a cup of coffee in the office there before he started work. In the east of the country, there is no sign of Russian attacks easing. The BBC's Tom Bateman says intense fighting hasn't eased in the Donbass region, including one report that four civilians were shot dead as they tried to flee a small township. So the situation is deteriorating there. I don't think it's got to the stage that everyone is expecting, which is a major Russian assault. It's really not clear when that might happen, even though we know that Russia has been moving troops and hardware into the region. And I think much of that hangs on the fate of the besieged port city of Madiupol in the southeast, because, you know, the city hasn't been captured completely by the Russians yet. There is still a holdout by possibly up to 2,000 Ukrainian forces there. So that is tying up still lots of Russian forces. But if that moment comes, that will allow the Russians to redeploy many of their troops. And you might see a far greater movement into the east. Joining us from the capital Kiev is New Zealand journalist Tom Much. Good morning, Tom. Good morning. So we're seeing attacks in the city where you are, or airstrikes, also in Leviv, in the West. What can we read into this? So I think one of the reasons that a lot of people are worried because of the airstrikes on LeViv, I should just say we've heard air raid sirens even today in Kiev going pretty much non-stop, although there have been no reports of strikes today, is that in LeViv was generally considered safe territory. It was Western Ukraine. It was far away from any of the front lines. There'd been no attacks that we'd seen, you know, in a couple of weeks now, especially no attacks, you know, very, very close to the city itself. Now a lot of people have become very scared that the Russians, because especially as it seems like they're targeting, you know, this was apparently close to a train station. We know that there was the attacking Krammatosk on a train station, that the Russians are more indiscriminately targeting civilian infrastructure, and they are actually targeting escape routes at the same time. And one idea is that we think that maybe they just want to send a message to Ukrainians, that there is nowhere currently in Ukraine that is safe for them at the moment. That seems like the significance of the attack on Lviv to me. Yes, and we're seeing, obviously, signs of this buildup for a big push into the eastern part of the country. Maripol remains the issue. Tell us a little bit about this extraordinary group of Ukrainians holding out in the steelworks. That would seem to be delaying Russia's push. of Ukrainians holding out in the steelworks that would seem to be delaying Russia's push. Yes, so basically what has happened is that the regiments, the Azov Battalion, and the 36 Ukrainian Marines Division have retreated to this massive big steelworks. I've been there, I was there just before the war and saw it myself. This place is huge. It's full of all of these underground tunnels and all of these. It's a very, very easily defensible location. It's basically a fortress in and of itself and apparently is quite well stocked and well supplied. And so while the defenders of Mariupol hold out in Azovstahl, the Russian forces are fixed in place there. They can't then go back north to threaten a major city in the area region like Nipro. They can't try this pincem movement that they want to do to track Ukrainian forces in the Donbass on the line of contact with the separatist forces. It basically, until they really capture Mariupol and they have it completely subdued the city, they can't really attack in the numbers that they would need to for a proper victory in the east. And the Russians have said, urged those forces to surrender, but the suggestion is from the Ukrainians, they will fight to the death? It seems they will fight to the death. Now, look, we know one of the brigades, for instance, is holding out the, sorry, one of the units that's holding out the Azov Battalion is a unit that has unfortunately had a lot of very far-right tendencies. Members with like neo-Nazi affiliations, basically they know that they, if they are found by Russia, they will be killed, no question, no court are given. And so that they will fight to the death because then they know that they're dead regardless, basically. They know if they, even if they surrender and try and leave, that they'll be taken in Russia infiltration and probably killed. So that is really a last stand for them. It is. So just finally, are we any clear on when this big push from Russia will come? Is the expectation that it will still be in the next few days week or so? I've heard the end of the week. One of the sources that I know who is currently fighting in the East told me that because of heavy rain in the East, the Russians have had to delay moving their equipment. However, I would foreworn to say that whenever I was in Kiev during the start of the war, we would keep hearing, oh, there's going to be a big Russian push in two or three days. We'd hear that almost every day. And that big Russian push, at least, into Kiev never really came and kind of petered out. It's not impossible this will happen in the east on the Dombas front lines as well. Tom Much, thank you very much for your time. Really appreciate it this morning. Tom Much is a New Zealand journalist in Kiev. The capital, it is 22 past 7. Latest traffic news in Dunedin this morning, a crash is closed. State Highway 1 headed south on Carlton Hill between Ryslow Road and Main South Road, to be careful and take care if that's the area you're in this morning. Now hundreds of people who've been convicted of drink driving more than once are getting away with never having an interlock device fitted to their vehicles. The device is fitted to a convicted drink driver's vehicle and ensures only a sober person can start the car. Emma Hatton reports. Last year just over 4,000 people received an alcohol interlock sentence, but the Automobile Association's research shows this is only about half of those eligible under a 2018 law change. It's up to the drivers to get the device installed, and the AA says only two-thirds of those sentenced get this done. Ministry of Transport Officials wrote to the Transport Minister late last year, calling the gaps a significant risk. The AA's road safety spokesperson Dylan Thompson agrees. That really matters because what the figures show is for each interlock we put into a car, it prevents about 100 attempts by somebody with alcohol in their system to drive a year. In July 2018, the Land Transport Act was amended to make alcohol interlock sentences mandatory for anyone convicted of two or more drink driving offences within a five-year period. The sentence also became mandatory for anyone convicted of driving with three times the legal limit of alcohol in their system. Dylan Thompson says following up on those who have been sentenced to make sure the device was fitted into their vehicle wouldn't be difficult. We've got the list of everybody who's been sentenced and then the interlock providers know who they have installed devices into the car. If we can get those two parts of the system talking to each other, then that'll give us that list. He also wants the Ministry of Justice to provide data on why those that were eligible for the interlock sentence didn't receive it. Policy manager at the ministry, Oliver Sanders, says there are a number of reasons why someone might not be sentenced, including some medical conditions, not having a driver's licence or a car, or living in an area with no interlock provider. Leah Abrams was hit by a drunk driver in 2015 and started a support charity no one ever stands alone shortly after. She says while interlocks aren't the silver bullet to the country's drunk driving problem, the system still needs to be beefed up. You know, all parties need to come together and a decision needs to be made on how it's actually going to work out on a day-to-day basis because the law is only as good as the practical application. The interlock system was supposed to be reviewed three years after it came into effect. This hasn't been done and a Ministry of Transport spokesperson said it would now be reviewed as part of the Road to Zero plan in conjunction with Waka Kotahi. When cabinet signed off on the law change, overseas data showed the devices reduced re-offending rates by 60%. Overall, the number of people receiving an alcohol interlock sentence has increased 10-fold since the law came into effect. It is 26 minutes past 7. You're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Hundreds and possibly thousands of new teachers have been underpaid since the start of the year. They're getting $2 to $300 a week less than they should, and some are struggling to get by. It's an annual problem, but because of COVID, it's taking the education payroll months to fix. Here's our education correspondent, John Gerritson. Every year, about 3.5,000 newly qualified teachers start work, and often they or their schools fail to provide the paperwork that ensures the pay rate matches their qualifications. The payroll system then classes them as unqualified until they prove otherwise, and this year it's taking months to get them on the right rate. This woman says she's being paid about $300 a week less than she should be. For the first few weeks, I was okay because I thought it's only going to be, you know, temporary. But as it went on, I just really struggled to start paying for my regular things. I'm really lucky to have a support of family who have lent me money here and there and I had a little bit of savings savings but now it's getting pretty dire. She says it's frustrating and every new teacher she knows is in the same position. Every single teacher who I talk to, everyone who's doing relieving, everyone who just started out seems like we're all in the same position. There's this huge kind of form with all of these extra things. We've got to get signed and verified and justice of the peace and all of that. But yeah, every beginner teacher I've talked to has said the same thing. Among them, this man, who says it's creating financial stress he could do without. It's frankly a little bit insulting. It can be quite an intense year for some people. And then to come into that for being full-time teachers, you're spending close to 50 hours a week because you work outside of school because you need to build up your lessons and your knowledge that takes quite a lot of out-of-school time and then to be rewarded by being, in some cases, quite horrifically underpaid. He does not understand why unqualified is the default setting for new teachers, even though they must have degrees and diplomas to get their jobs. I just find it a bit confusing because we all have all completed the same degree, and I think everybody basically starts on about grade three across the board, no matter what, when you finish your training, so it feels odd to have us on step one, which is no one can really start and teach on that. To add insult to injury, the teachers have been told that when their pay rates are fixed, their back pay will be taxed at a higher rate because it comes as a lump sum. Sheree Taylor Patel from the Principals Federation says the payroll system is incredibly complicated, there are recurring problems, and sometimes schools dip into their funds to help teachers out. This is not, you know, it's not something they want to do, but when it's the fault of the system and you've got a stressed person standing in front of you, you do what you can to help the situation along. I guess what's frustrating is that it keeps happening, you know, and that there are anomalies in our payroll system that just don't seem to be addressed. Vaughan Queerio from the Secondary Principles Association says this year's delays are so bad it's raised the problem with the ministry. There might be some administrative reasons why your first payroll is not quite right because you're onboarding and getting it right. But for it to roll into multiple payroll periods, that does indicate that there's an issue. The Education Ministry says it's trying to clear the backlog, but COVID has added to the delays. It says it's still figuring out how many teachers are affected. However, RNZ understands only a quarter of the applications sent at the start of each year are correct and complete. We're coming up before 8 o'clock on Morning Report to Fayaki-Nay. Mangari Budgeting Service, Chief Executive Daryl Evans, resigns after 20 years with the charity. Also investigations are underway into Saturday's police shooting of 22-year-old chaos price north of New Plymouth, and millions of dollars of rape pair money is being spent on CCTV cameras, which might not be making our streets any safer. Those last beeps bring a total to 21 cameras and 100 metres. And even with all these eyes on the street, there's still crime here, including a shooting last month. Kuta Tewa Motekew Porongo. Now news headlines at 730 with Anna Thomas. Thanks Susie. The finance minister expects the official inflation figure to rise when it's released later this week. Biggers are last week showed food prices were 7.6% higher compared to March last year. And the Reserve Bank last week raised its cash rate by the biggest increase in 22 years to combat rampant inflation. Grant Robertson's told Morning report all commentators are predicting an increase in the inflation figure this quarter and potentially the second quarter as well. He says for some people, that's causing a crisis. It's estimated at least a thousand civilians are holding, rather hiding in underground shelters beneath the vast as-of-style steel plant in the southeastern Ukrainian port city of Mariupo. The figure comes from the city council that says most of the civilians are women with children or the elderly. Elsewhere, Russia says it has hit 300 targets overnight. Ukraine reports at least nine deaths, including seven in the western city of Leviv, where five missile strikes were reported. Auckland Airport has sent its chief executive, along with the Prime Minister, to Singapore, to put out the call to tourists that New Zealand is opening back up. Carrie Hura Hanganui is one of 12 business leaders on Jacinda Adirn's first overseas mission since COVID-19 hit New Zealand's shores. New Zealand's borders reopened to visa-waiver countries, including Singapore from May 2nd. New teachers are frustrated that they're being underpaid by hundreds of dollars a week. They've been put on the pay rate of unqualified teachers. Education payroll sorts through the paperwork that proves their qualifications. Teachers say that's taking months, and in the meantime, they're being paid $2 to $300 a week less than they should be. Those spoken to by RNZ say the problem is creating financial stress, and it's affecting every new teacher they know. The Education Ministry says it's trying to clear the backlog. Those are the headlines now looking at weather around the centres, Kaita and Fungare, also Auckland showers with possible thunderstorms, chance of a downpour this morning, all of those centres, 24 degrees.

Now, Mangari Budgeting Service Chief Executive, Darrell Evans, has resigned, and the Budgeting Service Chief Executive Darrell Evans has resigned and the board of the high-profile charity has appointed a Queen's Council to oversee an inquiry into allegations former staff have made about his management style. Darrell Evans, who has been with the charity nearly 20 years, is refusing to comment but Guyon Espinner has been investigating and joins us now. Morena, Guyang, what do we know then about why Mr Evans has resigned? Well, several months ago now I was approached by a former staff member of the Maungari Budgeting Service who had concerns about the management style of Daryl Evans at the charity. I met with that former staff member and another five former workers, so six in all, all of whom had concerns about the pay, the conditions at the Mangari Budgeting Service and also the management style of the Chief Executive Darrell Evans. I put some pretty detailed concerns to Mr Evans and to the board of this budgeting service, which is chaired by a former lawyer named Alistair Hall. Now, Daryl Evans refused to respond, but the chairman Alistair Hall now says that Mr Evans has stepped down as CEO because of poor health. Mr. Hall said that Mr Evans had quote tended his resignation from the position on health grounds and our board has accepted it. And what do we know about this investigation looking into the concern staff raised with you? Yeah, Alistair Hall said that the charity had appointed a QC, the QC Simon Mount, to oversee an inquiry into these concerns and that they wouldn't make any further comment until that inquiry was completed. Now, Daryl Evans has been a pretty high-profile advocate for people in poverty. See him in the media quite a lot, including on television and on radio and in the print media. He's also pretty well connected politically. The patron of the Maangri Budging Service is the former Prime Minister and Labour leader Helen Clark. One of these former staff members I spoke to said that staff had been reluctant to speak out because of Daryl Evans' high profile and his political connections. The Public Service Association, they've been involved in this too. An organiser with the PSA, Simon Oosterman, said staff had approached the union about pay and conditions at the Budgeting Service. He described it as a go-to voice in the media for poverty and inequality, but said that the Board of the Budgeting Service itself had not committed to paying all staff at least the living wage. Now, again, the board didn't respond to our specific questions about staff wages. RNZ does understand that an interim CEO, a woman named Debbie Highland, is already in place there and that the board is searching for a permanent chief executive to replace Darrell Evans. Kuro Gai and Espin are there, our investigative reporter. With that report, it is now 24 minutes to wait. Investigations are continuing into the shooting by police of a 22-year-old man on State Highway 3 north of New Plymouth on Saturday night. It's the fifth fatal shooting by police in Taranaki since 2000. A police shot 22-year-old chaos price after he rammed a police car. He died at the scene. The police have declined to be interviewed, as has the president of the Police Association, Chris Cahill. With us now, New Plymouth City Councillor, Deney Mojahou. What are you, Deney? What for you was it like to hear this news about Chaos Price being shot by police? I think it conjured up a lot of bad memories for us as a region, but also the Fano involved. And it's just heartbreaking many hear news about a death in such a way. Not much detail coming out on this particular case. Does that concern you? It doesn't concern me. I think what's really important is that we have a family that are grieving and there is an investigation underway. More importantly, it's actually how do we come together as a community despite the tragedy that's unfolded over the past season. under way. More importantly, it's actually how do we come together as community, despite the tragedy that's unfolded over the past season. What do you want to see on that score? Sorry, what was that? What do you want to see when you talk about the community coming together in what way? I just think that there's always an opportunity to, one, have the family grieve for the passing of their family member, but also two is just the opportunity to come together as a tight-knit community. The Taranaki region has always been a close-knit community and it's always disheartening when you hear something like this. But patience is required for the investigation to undergo and then whatever the outcome is, we need to move forward from here, but it's always heart baking me here to use. I understand that you have known four of the five police shooting victims since 2000 that we were talking about here. What indication is there for you about what is going on here if there is indeed any link or any overarching reason? I don't want to speculate, but what I do know is that I know that this brings up a lot of heartache. There'll be Fana up there who have experienced a loved one being shot in our community that conjures up those bad memories as well. It's just a horrible thing to hear on the use, but I know that with the best of our intentions, the main focus is to allow the family of the deceased to grieve, to allow the investigation to continue, and whatever the outcome is, how can we move forward from here as a united community and region of Taranaki? The IPCA will be investigating here. Are they the right ones to investigate? IPCA will be investigating here. Are they the right ones to investigate? Well, they're normally appointed with any type of investigations, especially when it comes to something as serious as a shooting. So it's important for them to carry out this investigation. I know everyone in the community will be asking questions in how things unfolded. But it's just really important for all of us to make sure that we give the investigation time, we give the family time, and how can we put our support as a community. Namihi, thank you very much for your time. That is Dini Moyahu, the city councillor in New Plymouth. It is 20 minutes to eat. Rate payers have forked out more than $29 million over the past five years to install CCTV cameras. But experts say they don't necessarily make our streets safer. Here's data journalist Farah Hancock. How do you feel about being filmed when you are walking down a street? I'm in downtown Auckland's Fort Street and as I'm talking you're going to hear some beeps. We've added them in each time I pass a CCTV camera. There's some now. One camera was on a streetlight and others were on privately owned buildings. The patch of Fort Street I'm walking is roughly 100 metres long. On one side of the street there's a liquor store, a kebab shop, there's a KFC. There are a couple of bars. There's a jeweller towards the end. On the other side of the street there's a car park, public toilet and office buildings. That's 13 cameras so far and I'm only halfway down the street. Now it's true, Fort Street does have a bit of a reputation. Meryl hopeful Leo Maloy has had some choice words to say about it. This is where the losers and the rat bags and the drug addicts and the alcoholics, this is where they congregate at mine. But it's not all bad. At the Queen Street end of Fort Street, which have almost reached, is a seating area with trees, planter boxes and astroturf in the ground. It's the perfect spot to sit and enjoy lunch. Those last beeps bring a total to 21 cameras and 100 metres. If they were evenly spread out, it'll be one camera every 4.7 metres. And even with all these eyes on the street, there's still crime here, including a shooting last month. Three people were taken to hospital early this morning after a shooting in central Auckland. Police were called to Fort Street in about quarter to two after reports of a firearm being discharged. Victoria University's Trevor Bradley says CCTV cameras don't always deter crime, especially if people have been drinking. People are not rational when they've consumed large quantities of alcohol or when emotions are running high. They are completely oblivious to CCTV in those situations and of course that's where lots of violence occurs. What may come as a surprise is the only place CCTV cameras have been shown to prevent crime is car parks, but that hasn't stopped local authorities spending more than $29 million installing them over the past five years. They've been put in for a range of reasons, but security is the main one. Independent security consultant Lincoln Potter doesn't think cameras prevent crime. He uses his local superrette, which has 17 CCTV cameras and a smoke cloak as an example. With all his CCTV and his smoke cloak, it's not going to prevent an offender coming and jumping the counter and stealing his cigarettes. So you'd have to ask yourself, well, is CCTV preventing crime? And the answer to that is no, but is it enhancing post-evidential requirements? And the answer to that is yes, because you're getting better footage that you can hand on to the police. Solving crime isn't the same as preventing crime. To make towns and cities safer, Lincoln Potter says feet on the ground matter. So CCTV and surveillance needs to be supported by a response from a human being, a police officer, a security officer, a city custodian or whatever. Police data on what they call victimizations show these have increased by 16% between 2017 and 2021. Now, if you want to see where the cameras are in your neighbourhood, you can go to rnz.com.nz backstace. The streets have eyes and explore the map of cameras. It is 16 minutes to wait. You're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National and down to Christchurch now. We've got a bit of information that the traffic lights are out at the intersection of Carollets Road, Holswell Road, Hunhe Road and Lincoln Road. Do expect delays in the area there, so Kiatu-Pato will be careful if that's where you are this morning. Now, an Auckland woman who had a breast cancer operation postponed twice is one of thousands caught up in delays caused by Omicron. There were two and a half thousand fewer planned surgeries carried out in Auckland in the first three months of this year than last year. It's a sign of the impact the outbreaks had on those needing care as hospitals drastically scaled back services to cope. The 43-year-old mother, who was supposed to have surgery on March the 25th, three months after first finding a lump. But it was delayed, first because there were no theatres free, then again when her surgeon got COVID. She told health correspondent Roan Quinn how she took the news of the first delay. It was actually devastating because I'd worked up into, you know, like I'm not that great with surgery, to be fair, and I had this cancer. I knew it was in both sides. I was scared about it anyway. And it just felt like the rug was pulled out underneath me again because I hadn't expected, perhaps, naively, for it to be put back. And I was starting to mentally prepare myself. And there's a lot that you have to do really. I mean I was making a will you know, it was that frightening yeah so it just kind of and even though it was only a few days it really just pulled the rug out from underneath me and I really hit rock bottom for a couple of days. By that point I would imagine you also want the cancer out as soon as possible yes I mean I just you know I've talked to people about it. It's just like it feels like I've been carrying around a couple of dangerous strangers, unwanted passengers. And the longer that the week stretched on, the more it seemed like I wasn't going to get there before it started to spread. And because I am quite young, I do have a school-aged child. I was really starting to worry about the future and whether this was going to mean my chances of survival later were lower, basically. And so what happened after that first delay? So then they were able to re-book me for the 25th, and they sent out all the letters and everything, made all the appointments. And then a few days before that, I got another call to say that my surgeon had COVID. And at that stage, they weren't sure when they would be able to rebook it. But it would eventually come around the following week. So instead of the 25th of March, it became the 1st of April. And then with that second setback, then, what did you think? I think it was less difficult than the 1st in a way because I had by then finally learned not to actually hope that it was going to go ahead. Which is a very strange place to be. Yeah, I just learned not to hope, not to prepare myself for it, just to wait it out. And it's lucky I did, really. And then how did it go when you finally got your surgery? It was so great to finally get it over with, but it's incredibly hard. I mean, they rang me the day before to say that I would have to be dropped off at 6.30 in the morning. Nobody was allowed to come in with me, so I was going into this alone, which was just so frightening. And, yeah, I was really, really scared for a good couple of hours until it got started. And just, yeah, it's a very lonely situation to be in, basically. And what was the care like once you were in hospital and it was sort of finally happening? The care was fantastic, you know, everybody was great. I had plenty of information. I felt a lot more safe about what was going on once we all got started. The nurses were really caring. They were obviously under pressure, I suppose you might say. I'd ask them how they were going and they were saying, well, we've got a lot of people isolating again. Now, the woman talking there to RNZ Rowan Quinn says she is recovering really well. It's 11 to 8. A group of Waihiki Island restaurants and bars have discovered the power of banding together to get them through tough COVID times of staff shortages and scarce tourists. They're coordinating their opening hours and sharing some of their staff and even warning each other about rogue customers. Katie Todd has the story. Roe Isid was fresh to hospitality when she opened Heki restaurant in Ornitangi on Boxing Day last year, just a short time before Omicron restrictions came into force. It wasn't the ideal time or place to get a business off the ground. Like other tourist destinations, Waihiki Island has grappled with a dearth of foreigners, who made up a big part of their workforce and about 35% of spending. For two years it's relied on domestic tourists visiting mostly at the weekend. But Ms Isidz discovered the many competing restaurants and bars have each other's backs. We just give each other heads up on day-to-day things, you know, just as basic as, I mean, on the weekend I shared a photo of how long the ferry queue was from the city. And we can send people down the road if we fall. It's really great, and it's just real time, you know. She's part of a WhatsApp group where hospo operators pull their knowledge on finding tradies, resources and COVID-19 information and also tackle the big concerns. Because we're also desperately short-staffed. I think there's 1,200 fewer staff this summer than is needed on Wahiki because of the holiday visa situation. And if we're closed on a Wednesday, then we will let our staff go. For example, our bar manager down to Passage Rock and worked for them for a couple of days because they were really short staffed for that and they were happy to work on their days off. The chat group is the brainchild of Will Thompson who owns an eatery called Fennis. He started it last year so restaurants could spread out their opening hours and more effectively share the customers. Just so that we weren't all going to shut on like a Monday and Tuesday then the island would just almost come to a standstill on those days. So some people did change their time. And so Monday's actually turned into like quite a busy day for us in particular. Will Thompson says the group is like having eyes all around the island. Restaurants know when the ferries are full and they should get into fifth gear to prepare for big crowds through the door. He says recently a restaurant posted CCTV footage of a man who'd left without paying. And then the cellar door manager at Mudbrick, she sort of opened the phone up and she saw that the person was like having a wine tasting at Mudbrick. So she just sort of politely went over to him and just said, I'm not sure if you're aware but you forgot to pay your bill at one gig. And he was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry. Simon Pope co-owns Fission Chip Restaurant the local and says the chat's proven handy for other customers who are downright difficult. Especially when the old vaccine passes were mandatory. You'd get the odd fake one or you get, there was this crazy control group that said, oh, we're not vaxed and the group would send photos of those around and say, hey, look out for this person. And then there's those, according to Roe Isid, who have overindulged. Don't serve the drunk girl in the red drink. As restrictions lift in the country's borders creak open, the group of businesses say they're eager for the island to return to its pre-COVID bustling tourist mecca. But they say the chat group is here to stay. Eight minutes to eight, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. The Easter holiday road toll stands at four this year. That is considerably down on last year's toll of nine. The official holiday period ended at six this morning. Last year, nine people, as I say, died on the roads over Easter. Joining us now is the acting director of the National Road Policing Center Inspector Peter McKinney. Kiyore, good morning. Last year, nine people, as I say, died on the roads over Easter. Joining us now is the acting director of the National Road Policing Center, Inspector Peter McKinney. Kjura, good morning. Morena. So what are we to make of this better than last year, but still too many? Oh, exactly. You know, there's Sahelik. Still got four people killed on the roads, tragically. And that's four lots of loved ones who are mourning their deaths. And coupled with that, there'll be many more who are seriously injured. So we just need people to continue to be safe on the roads, concentrate on driving safely the whole time. And bearing in mind, Easter doesn't mean an end to the period where we have to take care. We've got Anzac weekend coming up and we're in the middle of school holidays. Can we read anything into the nature of these crashes, the types of crashes? Are we seeing any patterns or trends? Each of them was quite different, actually, but the common theme for all of them is the impact speed. So, you know, people have impacted at a speed that's not survivable. So we need people to drive to the conditions as best you can. You know, increase your following distance a bit, so you've got more line of sight and then more time and distance to respond safely when something unexpected happens in front of you and make sure everyone's got their seatbelt on and don't be distracted while you're driving or impaired. Were these crashes the result of going too fast above the speed limit? Not necessarily above the speed limit, albeit that's indicated at least one of them, but it's more the unexpected can happen, and you need to be able to get down to a speed where you can safely respond to that. And again, focusing on driving and being alert the whole time, just like accidents around the home, the unexpected happens, and you don't have time to whip on your seatbelt when it does. So you've got to be prepared. Were police out in force over the course of the weekend more so than they have been over the past two years with COVID? I haven't got exact figures on that, but we did have a focus on making sure we were visible on the road network over the holiday weekend. We don't know exact details, but certainly we wanted to be out there, and I'm sure we were. I certainly saw some officers around on the roads I travelled on over the weekend, which was great to see. And what about traffic volumes? As you mentioned, Anzac Day looming along a weekend, the holidays. Are you seeing greater volumes of people travelling on the road at the moment? I think people are, you know, rightfully excited by the fact that the lockdown period's finished and so I'm taking the opportunity to travel. And so, hey, look, there are more people on the roads. And what that means is when, hey, look, if someone inadvertently crosses the centre line for whatever reason, there's increased chances of someone coming in the opposite direction. So again, we just need people to be focused on safety all the time and ready to respond to the unexpected. And what impact is the weather having and has it had any impact? Again, weather is you can't control the weather. What we can do is control how we drive in response to the weather conditions. So if it is wet, if it is windy, slow down a bit, increase those following distances, and turn your headlights on if it's a bit murky. Thank you very much for your time. That is the acting director of National Road Policing Center. Inspector Peter McKinney, appreciate that. It is four minutes to eight. Well, cruise ships have returned to Australian waters more than two years after they were banned due to the spread of COVID-19. The first vessel sailing into Sydney Harbour yesterday was met with a fanfare from local tourism groups. But how safe are these floating giants? The ABC's Matt Bamford reports. We can't wait to come to Australia and complete our maiden season down under. Cruise ships are welcome back to Australian waters for the first time in more than two years. And if the latest advertising is anything to go by, it'll be full steam ahead. The P&O Pacific Explorer was the first to sail through Sydney Harbour, arriving after an 18,000 kilometre trip from Cyprus. New South Wales Transport Minister David Elliott was part of the welcome party. Well, this is going to be a very, very special day for the people of New South Wales and particularly those who love cruising with this new return of P&O cruises, which is just day one of what we hope we'll see, a return in force of those majestic ships. But cruise ships haven't always had a warm reception. In March 2020, the Ruby Princess became the source of the nation's first major COVID cluster. Infections on board led to hundreds of cases across the country and almost 30 deaths. It docked in Sydney one day before borders were closed. Jill Abel from the Australian Cruise Association insists the industry is safe and prepared to deal with the pandemic. So the key one is vaccination and it's mandatory vaccination with a maximum of only 5% on board that can't be vaccinated and that accounts for the children that can't be vaccinated. You know, there will be monitoring for wellness for symptoms and the likes but a mask wearing where social distancing can't happen, limiting people's moving in different spaces and the likes. But the key element is vaccination and that's what we've seen around the globe, where cruising's actually been up and going for quite a number of months now. Operators will also need to have outbreak management plans and COVID safety plans. COVID's not going to stay off cruise ships the same way as it's not staying off resorts and holidays and trains and planes and the likes and social events that we're at. It's all about ensuring that people are vaccinated and don't get too ill from the virus and then minimising the impacts of any cases on board. While it's reduced, the risk of infection remains. And Professor Nancy Baxter says transmission is inevitable. There will absolutely be outbreaks on these cruises. I mean, to think that there won't be a cruise with an outbreak of COVID, I don't think that that's reality-based. Every year you'd hear of cruises with outbreaks of gastrointuritis, like I said, cruises with outbreaks of Legionella, of flu. You know, it's a setting where you have a large number of people in a small place, and so there is going to be a higher risk of spread of infectious diseases. Well, that report from the ABC's Matt Bamford, I'd be interested to know what you think about this. Would you get back onto a cruise ship? Would you like to see cruise ships back? Are they floating petri dishes? What do you think, Corrin? Oh, not so keen at the moment. Not too now. 2101. Let us know. How am I? Good morning, New Zealand. You're a sting-to-morning report on RNZ National. Your weather today, there are rain or showers with possible thunderstorms for the north of the North Island, mainly fine elsewhere. Corcoran dance today. Kiora, co-suzzi Ferguson, Tokoingui. In this hour, the Prime Minister has landed in Singapore. Corcor and Dan, today. Kiora, Kauzei Ferguson, Tokoingauai. In this hour, the Prime Minister has landed in Singapore for the start of our first trade trip for two years. Journalist David Ferrier joins us to discuss allegations made by former members of a rise church. And also before nine, there's been a decline in cancer diagnosis since the Omicron outbreak. Billions of dollars has been pledged by countries across the globe to improve ocean conservation and after two-year hiatus the Coachella Music Festival returns in California. RNZ News at 8 o'clock. Good morning. I'm Anna Thomas. The finance minister expects the official inflation figure to rise when it's released later this week. Figures out last week showed food prices were 7.6% higher compared to March last year, and the Reserve Bank last week raised its cash rate by the biggest increase in 22 years to combat rampant inflation. Grant Robertson told morning a report all commentators are predicting an increase. This is a global phenomenon. It's driven by supply chain constraints, the impacts of COVID, the war in Ukraine. Everywhere around the world we're seeing this. The UK and the US are up over 8% now. So this is something that the whole world's dealing with. Ground Robertson says it is causing a crisis for some households. The Prime Minister has planned for the possibility she might catch COVID-19 while overseas, but says she's not anxious about being stuck offshore. Jacinda Ardern has touched down in Singapore and will travel on to Japan later in the week in what is her first international trip in more than two years. She says there is no escaping that COVID-19 is still affecting the world. It's the reality of travel today, and our view is that now is the time to get out and about, and so we're willing to take on board the risks that that presents in terms of travel. If Jacinda Adern does catch COVID-19, she will isolate wherever she is, and the mission will continue with the trade minister in charge. The UN says humanitarian ceasefires are not currently on the horizon in Ukraine. Russia is yet to agree to terms proposed by the UN for any pause in the fighting. Our correspondent Sarah Walton reports. After visiting Moscow and Kiev, the UN Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, said he'd set out to authorities from both countries, how a pause in fighting can work, and how it would be monitored. But he said that while the Ukrainian authorities had agreed to most of the proposals set out, he was still waiting to get a response from the Russian Federation, and he said it felt it wasn't their top priority. He called on all parties to return to negotiations and to give further guarantees that humanitarian convoys will be protected. He also said that going forward, there must be accountability for everything that's happening in Ukraine right now. Indications are growing that Russia has launched its anticipated major military attack in the east. A community leader says the shooting of a man by police near New Plymouth has opened old wounds in the region. 22-year-old chaos price was shot on Saturday night after he rammed a police car. Andrew McCray reports. Five people have been shot by police in Taranaki in the last 22 years. New Plymouth City Councilor Dinny Moyahu says everyone's in shock and grieving. He says while the shooting might be a symptom of a wider problem, the community shouldn't speculate about what happened until the investigation is complete. Mr. Moyahu says emotions are running high and patience is required. A woman who had breast cancer surgery postponed twice in the Omcron outbreak is one of thousands of orchanders caught up in surgical delays. Figures from the city's three district health boards showed two and a half thousand fewer people had surgery in the first three months of the year than in the same period last year. Services were drastically scaled back as staff got sick and space was needed for beds. A 43-year-old mother says it was devastating to get the news her operation had been postponed three months after she first found a lump. It feels like I've been carrying around a couple of dangerous strangers, unwanted passengers. And the longer that the week stretched on, the more it seemed like I wasn't going to get there before it started to spread. The woman's now had surgery and is recovering well. Hundreds of new teachers are being underpaid by up to $300 a week. It happens at the start of every year if new teachers or their schools fail to provide correct paperwork to the Education Ministry. But it's now taking months to fix because of COVID. Post-P Primary Teachers Association President Melanie Webber told Morning Report. Most of the new teachers have been paid the bottom of the untrained teaching scale. Secondary teachers, they'll also have a degree, so they should be starting far higher up. So if they started them at that higher point and then assess people wouldn't be struggling to get by on these very, very low salary. The Ministry says it is trying to clear the backlog. Members of the Nurses' Organisation will be asked if they want to legally challenge an historic pay equity settlement. The Union backed out of an agreement to ratify the deal last week, claiming the agreement is legal as it doesn't include back pay to 2019. Its chief executive Paul Goltes says union members have two options to consider. They'll be asked to vote on taking the matter to the Employment Relations Authority or going ahead with the deal as it stands in a few weeks time. The government has ruled out allocating any more money. Former members of the Arise Church say the congregation puts an unhealthy emphasis on money. The founding member of one of the country's biggest churches, John Cameron, resigned last week after allegations that interns were mistreated. Former member Ashley describes Arise as having a very cult-like following. She says she looked into being an intern before discovering it would cost her $2,000. Every single service, the title was intervised. They even had 18s in the foyer in a special app you could use. It was driven to us each time, 10% of the earnings, as it says in the Bible. An independent review into the culture of the church is about to get underway. Heavy rain is expected in isolated parts of New Zealand in the next two days. The west coast of Northland could get 150 millimetres until Thursday, and a bay of plenty 90mm are anticipated to fall around Takhtane. Southland is likely to break through the recent dry period with consistent rain until the end of the week. And with Laninia lingering longer over Altirua this year, Met Service expects mild temperatures, wind and rain for the rest of autumn. And that's the news. Now with sport, here's Barry Guy. Joel King says winning the Manchester Open Squash title is a wonderful reward after a difficult tournament. The New Zealand's second seed beat the sport. Here's Barry Guy. Joelle King says winning the Manchester Open squash title is a wonderful reward after a difficult tournament. The New Zealand's second seed beat the top seed, England's Sarah Jane Perry, in straight games in this morning's final. This week has been a roller coaster. My body has been in bits, and people have been putting me back together. So I'm just, yeah, I'm emotional because it means so much. King is the first player to win the Manchester Open twice. The Pulse buried the memory of last week's meltdown to beat the Magic 5239 in their A&Z netball game in Rotorua. The Pulse bounced back from their extra time lost to the steel seven days ago by dominating the magic from the first to last whistle, much to the delight of player of the game. Goal keep Kelly Jury. It's just building on last week, I think, massive turnaround. We were up by 11 going into that last quarter of game, so it was a bit of deja vu. But I think this week we really didn't want to be scared. We were scared of that lead last. So just keeping it calm and confident. The Pulse are third in the standings with the magic last. The Crusaders captain, Scott Barrett, Hurricanes Hooker Asopo Amoa, and the Highlanders Lock, Josh Dixon, have all copped bans for dangerous play in the latest round of super rugby. Amora and Dixon have been suspended for three weeks with Barrett banned for four, with the incidents all involving contact with an opposition player's head. It's been a hectic month for the Wellington Phoenix. They've played seven games in 23 days, including Sunday's 4-0 defeat to Central Coast in Wellington, their first game in New Zealand in more than 10 months. Midfielder Nicholas Pennington says they're looking forward to a bit of rest and having a full week's preparation for Sunday's game against Western Sydney at Eden Park. They didn't really have a chance to prepare properly in quite a long time, so definitely looking forward to that, just getting to the game, a bit more rested and a bit more prepared. It will help us do well, and we'll just have to show it on Sunday. The Phoenix is fifth on the A-League ladder, and the Portuguese football star Cristiana Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez have announced that one of their newborn twins has died.

RNZ National, it's 10 past 8. And you're listening to Morning Report with Corundan and Susie Ferguson. Well, the Prime Minister has touched down in Singapore. Jacinda Ardairn arrived at Changi Airport last night on her first overseas trip in more than two years. She's travelling with Trade Minister Damien O'Connor, ministry officials, and a 12 strong team of top business executives. Our deputy political editor Craig McCulloch is also on the trip, I asked him, if there have been any hitches so far? No hitches so far. We have made it out of New Zealand. We cleared the pre-departure tests, flew to Keynes and then on to Singapore. We're promptly tested again on arrival. There are a lot of tests this trip, but for now we are in the clear. It's COVID-free, and the trip can proceed as but for now we are in the clear. It's COVID-free and the trip can proceed as planned for now. A two-year hiatus, so why is it that Singapore and Japan are the ones at the front of the queue? Yes, it may seem somewhat peculiar that these two countries are front of the queue. Logistics is the simple answer as to why them first. Now the Prime Minister had a wish list of countries. She wanted to visit this year. Logistics is the simple answer as to why them first. Now, the Prime Minister had a wish list of countries. She wanted to visit this year. These are basically the two which work right now. Remember that the Prime Minister tried to visit both Australia and Europe last year, but Delta put an end to that. Now, Australia and France are both in the midst of election campaigns, which means that a visit to those countries will just have to wait. She's already off to the US in May, and China is a little bit tricky. It's kind of out of the question because it's stripped COVID-19 restrictions, which brings us back to where we are, Singapore, and then Japan as well, both major trading partners for New Zealand, number five and four, and they are important relationships for New Zealand here in the Indo-Pacific region. New Zealand is trying to diversify its trade, doesn't want to be quite so reliant on China, and these two countries are key to that, and that is a big reason why we're here. So the purpose then, trade the key focus? Yes, trade, tourism and diplomacy. That's how I would sum it up the big three. The Prime Minister is travelling with, as mentioned before, 12 strong business delegation. These are top executives from the likes of Zespri and Fontera, and they all have this goal of drumming up trade, using a little bit of that brand, Jacinda Ardun, to help that along. There's also tourism, of course, New Zealand's borders open to visa waiver countries in two weeks. That includes Singapore and Japan, so it's Haidimai to them. And finally, diplomacy, a chance to sit down face to face with the leaders of both countries, to reconnect after more than two years, strengthen those bonds. There is lots to talk about with China flexing its influence in the region. Russia's war on Ukraine, there is a lot to squeeze in and just four days to do it. But of course, it comes in the time of COVID. It must be a pretty different trip to perhaps others you've been on. What are the precautions in place? COVID-19 has completely changed the nature of this trip. For one, it has made the planning of it a complete nightmare in terms of the various border restrictions, the testing requirements. Like Japan, for example, it's only just very recently relaxed its border restrictions. Had this trip happened a few months ago, for example, the trip would have been far more constrained in terms of numbers. As it is, we kind of are operating on normal numbers for an overseas delegation of the size. But when we are on the ground, we of course have to be masked at nearly all times. And we are operating to some degree within bubbles as well. This is just the reality now of prime ministerial travel when you're in a COVID world. Not only do you have to navigate the various schedules of world leaders, you also have to take into account the differing border requirements and their restrictions. So what happens if someone on the trip, the prime minister or someone else, catches COVID? Yes, a very good question and one that is quite relevant to my interests. If anyone catches COVID-19 on this trip, basically they have to adhere to the rules wherever they are. And that, of course, includes the Prime Minister. Now, here in Singapore, that means isolating for up to seven days. In Japan, it would be a 10-day stint of isolation. And in the meantime, the mission carries on without you. And yes, again, that includes the Prime Minister. So the train minister, Damien O'Connor, he is along for the ride. And if the Prime Minister is taken out mid-trip and has to isolate, then Damien O'Connor will take over and carry on in her absence. We have kept COVID-free so far. So here is hoping that can continue. All right. So day one, what is going to be taking place? Yes, a busy first day. It begins with a business breakfast. Then the Prime Minister will be officially welcomed at the Astana. That's the presidential mention here in Singapore. She'll briefly speak with the President. Then she'll sit down with Prime Minister Lisein Long. Later on, Ms. Adun will heed to a gala dinner and speak to Singaporean business leaders. So a lot going on and driving that message, New Zealand is back, back on the road and back in business. That is our Deputy Political Editor Craig McCulloch speaking to us from Singapore. It's 16 past 8. To discuss the trip further, we're joined by Connorner English, the executive chairman from Fiber Fresh. Michael Fox, a director of external relations at Zespri and veteran trade expert, Charles Finney, who is a Will Yarns board member and the independent chair of the Port Company CEO group. Good morning to you all. Morena. Michael, if I start with you, Zespri, you've been sending plenty of kiwi fruit to Japan and elsewhere. What's the importance of this trip, given you still being exporting? Hugely important. So I think the benefits of the relationships we've built have shown themselves for the last few years when we haven't been able to get to market. We've still been able to export that fruit. We've still been able to deliver returns to New Zealand growers. But I just think the benefits of getting back in front of these people, being able to shake their hands, to be able to thank them for that support, being able to discuss those sort of challenges and opportunities in person are so important. And we saw that with our CEO there last week. Just a great opportunity for us to get back to those markets and get back in front of people. Charles Finney, the infrastructure logistics in terms of supply change, I wonder, as someone who's a port company CEO group chair, how important that is. Will you be wanting to see some feedback on those supply chain issues, which are a problem for Asia? I think we know pretty much what's going on, but obviously Singapore is a very major component in that supply chain, and of course Japan is one of our major markets and anything that can happen to make the supply chain work more efficiently is going to be in the interest of our exporters. And Connor, in terms of future trade and expanding our trade, do you see any areas for growth in terms of bilateral trade negotiations from this trip? Well, look, for us and our company, we sell horse feed and car feed into the racing and sports horse markets and obviously the dairy sector. And yeah, we do see opportunities for growth. And we think that a trip that the Prime Minister is important. We sell into Singapore and into Japan along with South Korea and other markets. So the more that we can get, you know, the Prime Minister exposed in those markets and build those country-to-country relationships so that you can get those agreements progressing and we've had the CCTV or whatever, I haven't quite got the right name there. The former TPP, I think everyone knows. Yeah, yeah. So that's made a difference, but our biggest challenge right now is logistics, as Charles talked about, and that's, you know, horse eats every day, and we need to get their feed to them so they can eat every day, and that's been a challenge. Charles, you've covered these sorts of trips before. You know what goes on. How much of a difference do they really make in terms of having a Prime Minister there in terms of hard cash for companies, profits and bigger sales? I don't think you're going to see any trade deals negotiated in a six-day trip. They'll have been pre-prepared. All will happen afterwards. But it's a great way to open doors, a great way to signal to the world that we are actually able to travel again. A fantastic news, I think, for the tourism industry. And hopefully, good news for international education as well. Tourism and international education have been really hardly hit over the last two years, more so than goods exporters. Michael Zespri and it's I guess, push into Japan, how important is that market now? When we look at the over-reliance, some would argue, on China, the importance of growing those markets in Japan would be pretty significant, wouldn't it? It's usually important. So it already is our second largest market, and it's a really sort of high-value market as well. There's a really strong and increasing to market for it, and it's of a high value market as well. There's a real, really strong and increasing to market for it and it's actually our fastest growing market as well. So as you say we are, you know, not just ESPRI, but other businesses are really focused on that diversification on opening up new market opportunities. But Japan certainly is a really important market for us. And Connor, do you see the Asia area as the most important in terms of New Zealand trying to continue to diversify its trade? Well, for us, Japan, as Michael said, it's a high-margin market, a high-value market. But our particular company, we're just expanding into Germany at the moment because, you know, the horse sector over there is a significant one, and it's a high value market as well. So I think different companies will go to whatever suits their product or service, but this Japan's certainly important to us. We're also expanding into Hong Kong, finally enough, and that's something that we're pushing pretty hard here. Charles, perhaps if we just delve a little bit into the changing geopolitical world, I mean, going back out two years on from COVID and a world which is seeing, I guess, a move away, you could argue from multilateral trade or multilateral organizations, how's that going to be approached, do you think, by the Prime Minister in New Zealand? Well, clearly, in the last few years, bilateral and regional trade agreements have become more important. Singapore, I think, maybe Australia matches them, but Singapore is probably a largest partner in terms of numbers of agreements, five or six. But now we've got free trade agreements with Japan through CPPP and RSEP. And Japan really was the large power that forced CPPP through. It showed real leadership in that space. And more geopolitically, I think as the region is looking with some concern at some things China might be doing, Japan becomes all the more important for us. So I was really pleased that Prime Minister has chosen these two markets as her first international travel destinations. Charles Foney, thank you very much for your time. Will Yarn's board member and independent chair of the Port Company CEO group. Also speaking to Conner English, the executive chairman from Fiber Fresh and Michael Fox, Director of External Relations at Zespri. It is 22 minutes past eight. Former members of one of the country's biggest churches say it spent the money it tithed from its members on grandiose services and huge fees for overseas speakers. They say the glitter and the freebies are all designed to attract young people, many of whom were then mistreated. John Cameron, the founding pastor of Arise, has resigned after interns claimed they were overworked and overwhelmed. A few years ago when Ashley was a teenager, she attended Arise and thought about becoming an intern, but the price of admission to the roll, $2,500, was too steep. You were also expected to commit full-time and would be left with barely any time to have actual paying work to support yourself. But in terms, work long hours and rather worked. I felt sorry for them. Ashley says her first impressions of a rise were great, but she soon began to think that money was the church's main focus, especially with the expectation members would donate 10% of their earnings as a tithe. Every single service, the title was intervised. They even had 18s in the foyer in a special app that you could use. It was drilled unto us each time, 10% of the earnings, as it says in the Bible. Well, the Arise Church has not returned our calls. With us now is David Farrier, the journalist who broke this story on his own website. Kiora, David. Kiora, thanks for having me. Well, thanks for coming on and for talking to us about some of your findings. Some of these stories, obviously you heard there from Ashley, but what are some of the other aspects that you have discovered? Yeah, well, people started getting in touch with me about six months ago, and since some controversy was happening with Hillsong Church, another mega church in Australia, the floodgates opened, and I now have sort of 400 pages of emails and testimony sent to me. And, you know, as well as the emotional sort of abuse of interns and, you know, obviously making students tithe 10%. And when I say making them, I mean incredible pressure to do so because that's how you get eternal salvation. You know, I've also been told stories of rape and sexual assaults from church members being reported to life group leaders. And those stories essentially being hushed up. And at times instead, the church deciding to lecture those students on having consensual sex, sort of being more concerned about that than the sexual assaults that were being told to leaders. On top of that, we've also heard stories of John Cameron, the lead pastor grabbing interns by the collar and being verbally abusive and just a general culture of bullying within those tears. And I'd also have to clarify he hasn't resigned. He hasn't, he stepped aside. And that has been sort of rightfully sort of, you know, the media sort of thought, oh, he's resigned. He hasn't. The church says that he has not resigned his employment, John Cameron. He remains an important part of the Ari's family, despite these accusations. Nonetheless, there is a review going on. What are you thinking is likely to come from that? I can't predict what will come from that. I mean, you've got an interesting situation. We have a lot of people, you know, to be clarified, a rise works very well for some people. If you're in that system, it's wonderful. It's when it starts to not be wonderful that there's the problem. And, you know, it's whether these people are willing to talk to a reviewer that is then going to pass those reviews on to arrive. I think we might have lost David Farrier. That sounded like a little click there on the line. I think he's perhaps disappeared. We'll hopefully get him back. While we're waiting, though, we did approach Arise Church for comment. They said they could only make the following statement while the reviews are taking place. The Arise Board continues to acknowledge the hurt and the pain that has been expressed. We reaffirm our earlier statements made in regard to changes to the Board and the independent review that is currently underway. We await its findings. Due to sensitivity and privacy reasons, we are unable to comment on specific allegations or individual employment circumstances. We want to strongly encourage anyone who has a complaint or negative experience to engage with the independent reviewer. It is important we hear and understand these stories in order to help bring relief and healing to those who are in pain and put into place any corrective action that may be needed. Now, at 27 minutes past state, let's get to... Actually, I think we can go back to David, I think we can go back to David. I think we can go back to David. David, I think you're back with us. Apologies, blame being in Los Angeles right now. That's all right. Technical greglins happen. We were talking a little bit about what could come from this independent review. You were talking, I think the last we heard about how for, you know, for people within the Arise congregation, this is something that does work for them. But I think you were probably about to tell us about how I assume it doesn't work for others. Yeah, certainly. Yeah, for some people, it obviously doesn't work for them, and these traumatic things have happened. And it's a question of whether they want to approach this independent panel, which at the stage I understand is two people, and essentially go through those things again. They're obviously more than welcome to. It's whether they want to, if they want to do that or not. And then obviously there's a question of whether those findings make any real change. I mean, this independent board is going to report back to Arise and to John Cameron. And, you know, Arise Church does not have to take those on board. And I'm incredibly curious what will happen. And, you know, so far, we have essentially John Cameron still leading the church. He stepped aside, but the church has made it very clear that he remains an important part of the family there. And whilst he has stepped away from the board, along with his brother Brent, he still had final decision on who would replace him on that board. And I wouldn't be surprised if we see him back on the board in the future. Now, some of the people that you've spoken to, are they likely to approach the two people that are going to be leading this review and actually talk to them about some of their experiences? A lot of them, I think, the ones, you know, I'm still being in touch with, I think, are deciding whether they want to do that or not. I mean, last time they tried to talk about their problems, it went pretty badly for them. And I think the idea of talking to these about this again with another group that is going to take those findings back to a rise, you know, it's somewhat daunting. And I think they're deciding whether they are able to do that or not. I think there is some distrust out there and probably unfounded, though, about what that external board is and what is going to happen with that information. You know, you've got people that attempted to talk about their assaults and rape with the church, and that didn't go well. So I think the idea of talking about it again, you know, there's a problem there. Thank you very much for your time and for joining us from L.A. That's David Farrier, the journalist who broke the story around the Arise Church. And there's a lot more that you can read on his webworm. He's got several stories up there. It is now half past eight. Time for an update on the markets with Charles Bickford. Good morning, Charles. What's happening out there? Wall Street's had a bit of a choppy session. Started negative, went positive, and has ended negative. Not by too much. Wholesale interest rates hitting a three-year high. Expectations of aggressive tightening in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Some reasonable earnings reports and investors are looking forward to those coming through the week. The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 were down 0.1%, the NASDAQ 0.3% lower. Local top 50 index starts at 11,892, after Thursday's rather modest 17-point gain, but it did break a six-day losing streak. New Zealand dollar 67.2 US cents, 91.5 Australia, 51.7 British Pence, 0.624 euro, 85.4 Japanese yen and 4.28 yuan. Brink crude oil just eased off a little bit, but it's still up a dollar 30. That's just over 1% at 130 US dollars a barrel. And gold is flat at 1,977 US an ounce. Today we have a look at the latest report on the services sector. Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr was just currently talking to the International Monetary Fund about policy in the time of COVID and high inflation. Bottom line is the country needs aggressive monetary policy, he says. And the new solar company has emerged from the shadows this morning, an outfit called Helios Energy, which is looking to set up solar farms around the country. We'll bring your details on all those stories and the latest from the markets, around 20 past 12 in Midday Report. Kiyodara, thank you very much, Charles. Now, Ifaiak much, Giles. Now, Ifaiakene, still to come before 9 here on Morning Report. There's been a decline in cancer diagnosis and treatments since the Omicron outbreak. NASA gets set to broadcast a message to any alien civilizations. And music festival, Coachella, returns in full force without COVID restrictions. We speak to a music critic about the two jam-packed weekends, and we'll have your feedback. Not a lot of support for the return of cruise ships, it has to be set. Now the headlines with Anna Thomas. Thanks, Corin. There are growing indications that Russia has now launched its anticipated major military attack in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's top security officials says Russian forces are trying to break through along the entire front line of Donesk, Lohansk and Kharkiv regions. Security Council Secretary Olesi Danilov is in televised comments, says the offensive had opened this morning, and Presidential Chief of Staff Andre Yomak urged Ukrainians to believe in their army to repel their attacks. Police are calling for people to continue to take care on the roads beyond Easter weekend. The Easter holiday road toll stands at four this year, considerably down on last year's toll of nine. The official holiday period ended at six this morning. Co-director of New Zealand Road Safety Partnership Inspector Peter McKinney told Morning Report four deaths is still too many. The US City of Philadelphia is reintroducing a mask mandate due to rising COVID cases. Infections are up in more than 30 states fuelled by the spread of Omicron. But a judge in Florida has struck down the Biden administration's mask mandate on airplanes and other forms of public transport. The mandate was recently extended into next month. And a group of 27 restaurants and bars on Oaxi Island have formed a group chat on social media to coordinate their opening hours and share staff. They say banding together has helped them with a shortage of staff and tourists on the island and even alert one another to rogue or difficult customers. The group chat was started by Will Thompson, who owns an eatery called Fanece. He says it's like having eyes all around the island, allowing venues to know when the fairies are full and customers are coming, or if there's anyone they should be wary of. And he says there's strength and numbers because nobody's questions or requests for help go unanswered. And that's the news. Kiyoda, I'm Sharon Brett Kelly. Today on the detail, our closed borders have exposed our reliance on migrant labour. So we've become addicted to migrant workers as a very important source of labour in this country. Now their opening, migration is set for a shake-up. Our challenge will be how many should we look to attract and can we retain both microworkers but also New Zealanders. The detail on Apple, Spotify, RNZ or wherever you get your podcasts. And now taking a look at the weather around the country.

Danidam, Partly Cloudy, and in Vicaragua, Pantley Cloudy, a brief light shower possible this afternoon in 19 degrees. It's 24 tonight. And this is Morning Report. Latest figures show there has been a decline in cancer diagnosis and treatments thanks to the Omicron outbreak. Data from Tejahou the Cancer Control Agency indicates overall diagnosis fell by 2% meanwhile prostate lung and colorecta cancer surgeries dropped by 9% across January and February this is compared with the same time in the previous year joining us now is Cancer Society Medical Director Dr George Laking. Good morning to you. Oh, kiora, korek, koran. Okay, what do you think is happening here? Let's start first with the diagnosis is falling. People just not getting to the doctor, are they? Yeah, so the first thing is that there's going to be the same amount of cancer out there as there always has been. There's no reason to expect there's actually less cancer around. So what we're looking at is a delay in diagnosis. We saw this in the first round of the pandemic back in April 2020. Diagnosis fell by 47% the first time around with COVID. And with Omicron, we're seeing history repeat itself. How do you mitigate that? Surely there's got to be a way to improve on that if we knew what happened last time? Sure. Well, as I think about this, it makes me realize how much of a bite the pandemic really has. And I think it's a decision for us as a country to take this on board how much we are serious about getting cancer diagnosed in time and continuity of services. But you need to have some slack in the system so that when the pressure is on, as happens when there's a peak of COVID, that we can still continue with continuity of our work, Corrin. Indeed. Looking across the Tasman, there's a story in the front page of the age this morning about a $1.5 billion attempt to clear their backlog of people waiting for surgery, in particular cancers. I mean, does it require a sort of a one-off cash injection to try and catch up? COVID's a marathon, not a sprint, Corrin. This is a global problem. The World Health Organization is very aware of the impact of COVID on health systems around the world. So, yeah, sure, it makes sense to meet a spike in COVID with a injection of resource but there will be more spikes after this so also important is our overall strategy for containing COVID in our country right so are we seeing surgery simply delayed because either the doctor or the patient gets COVID and one or other and it can put things off for weeks? It's about as simple as that. Not only the doctor or the patient, you know, it might be the cleaner so you can't run the theatre, for example. At any point in the supply chain, the disruption from COVID can lead to a delay. And with some of these curative surgeries, it's known that every four-week delay in surgery increases the chance of death from that cancer by between 6% and 7% for every four-week delay. Yeah, that is tough to hear. So, is there any way of doing things better, organising things better, to prevent that happening? Obviously, hopefully we're coming off the peak. Maybe that will start to improve. Well, I think the first thing is awareness. I think it all starts with awareness. And so I've really got to salute the work of Tiahua de Kahu in publishing these reports so that people are aware of the effect that COVID has on our essential services. I think without awareness, it would be very hard to get focus and adjust our system so that we can absorb the blows that the COVID sends to us. What about slightly longer term in terms of screening and those sorts of resources? Yep, so very much so. This works to increase the argument for screening because screening in turn works for early diagnosis. However, we're also seeing with COVID that screening services are disrupted as well. So we've got to work on shoring those up also. We're behind in cervical screening, for example. So how quickly do you think we can try and arrest this backlog? We were able to arrest it during the course of the year 2020 when it happened in April 2020. By the end of that year, we'd basically caught up. The most recent report from Tiahor Takahu goes up to February. As of that report, we had started to catch up for non-Mori, non-Pacific, but we weren't catching up for Māori or Pacific. And that was another aspect of concern in this most recent report from Tiaho Takahu. And then you think of the burnout and the stress and the strain on the, well, lots of workers, but medical professionals, obviously, with COVID. It's a real thing, Corin, and come back to that point. It's a marathon, not a sprint. But again, the starting point for me is that we can see that this is happening, and so long as we can see what's happening, then we can get some energy behind shoring up our system so that we can continue to do these things we value greatly as a society, i.e. diagnose and treat cancer in time. Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you very much for that update. That is Cancer Society. Medical Director, Dr. George Laking. It is 18 minutes to nine. More than 16 billion US dollars has been pledged by countries at the Arocean Conference in Palau to help shore up conservation and sustainable fishing. Over 500 delegates from more than 80 nations attended the two-day conference in Palau. RNZ Pacific's Moira Tuleypa Taylor was at the conference. Palau and the United States co-hosted the conference, which is seen as a key global events for countries to commit to concrete and significant actions to protect the ocean. The U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry says the money raised will go towards the six areas of the conference, confronting the ocean climate crisis, creating sustainable blue economies, sustainable fisheries, marine protected areas for communities, ecosystems and marine pollution to achieve a safe, just and secure ocean. Everybody participating and giving and caring in a very community collegiate fashion. I think it's terrific. I wish so many more people could see and feel the texture of this because it was really impressive. This is the seventh year of the conference and the first time it's been held in the Pacific region. Don Kerry says it's been great working with the government of Bilau, and in particular it's President Surin al-Wipps Jr. President Whips and I have worked hard at this in the last couple of years. And I admire the way he's approached it. I admire his hard work to make it happen. And, you know, we go on from here. We just build, keep building since 2014 the our ocean conference has raised more than 100 billion US dollars from governments as well as stakeholders businesses and non-government organizations the New Zealand government is pledging over six million US dollars over the next four years three Three million of that will fund climate change research by the University of the South Pacific and the University of Canterbury. Their job will be to come up with sound data on the many climate challenges facing the Pacific. The rest of the money, 3.4 million, will go to the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency or FFA based in Solomon Islands. It was set up by the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, or FFA, based in Solomon Islands. It was set up by the Pacific Islands Forum to help Pacific Nations and territories sustainably manage their fishery resources within their 200-mile exclusive economic zones. New Zealand's Minister for Pacific People's Al-Bizor William Seale says this work is vital. We're wanting to support them, being able to access the other markets, for Pacific peoples, Al-Bizzo William Seale, says this work is vital. We're wanting to support them, being able to access the other markets, particularly the European Union. And secondly, it's about helping to support the small fisheries. How do we get them to better make good investment decisions? And the third part is really a leadership program for women. Getting more women into fishery jobs and leadership roles is also a focus for the Director-General of the FFA, Dr Manumata Vaid to Polruzen. For example, making sure that women in the tuna fishery sector that were able to lift their profile, put them into leadership, more leadership positions, that were able to help crew on fishing vessels to improve their conditions, that were able to get businesses accessing more markets. So it is fundamental. The next Out Ocean Conference will be in Panama in 2023. Our NZ Pacific's manager, Moira Tui Leber Lebe Taylor covered that conference in Palau. Her trip was made possible by the US State Department 14 minutes to 9. Now lots of feedback coming in this morning. Thank you for that, 201 on the text. Starting with teachers underpaid, being underpaid hundreds of dollars a week. Len says new teachers should automatically be started on the first step of the qualified teachers pay scale. It is just plain bureaucratic madness to assume that all starting teachers are unqualified until proved otherwise. They would not have been appointed into the job if they were unqualified. How are we going to encourage our young people into teaching with this sort of hostile welcome to the profession? This person writes saying if someone in the private sector was underpaying staff, the labour inspectorate would be involved and fines would be happening. Also, Vivian from Invercargo says, not paying me the right wage? Try that in any other industry and employees walk out. This person is a stay-home parent and works as a relief teacher. This is my first year of teaching and I am getting paid. The minimum amounts getting paid properly would make a huge difference for me. And Quentin from Otago says his daughter was underpaid for two years as a new teacher. It says when the back pay, when it came, was not only taxed at a higher rate, but together with a one-off payment for teaching science commitment, took her pay for the year to above the limit for a Homestart Grant, so she missed out on that. Her pay then dropped back to below the Homestart Limit. Now, on the return of cruise ships to Australia and then, of course, potentially one day maybe to New Zealand, this person says, yes, bring back cruise ships to New Zealand. The risk isn't much different to being in restaurants, concerts and large offices. Most weren't... Most weren't wanting them. You wouldn't be far from the truth saying this person isn't a fan. Cruise ships are floating garbage dumps, they say. Waste generated, pollute our oceans while they're at sea and add to our landfill problems while at port. It's a fallacy to say they contribute hugely to our economy. Passengers spend very little in the local economy. Emma says I hope they don't return. They are not only floating petri dishes but also unsustainable environmental disasters. Another person says mask wearing on a cruise ship, get real. Your interviewed spokesperson on cruise ships is having us on. Hashtag, floating petri dishes. Make that one go. Floating petri dishes. I reckon that could have a bit of a life of its own, a hashtag like that. Now 12 minutes to nine. Lynn Freeman is with us. Kiyora. Kiyora, Susie, great to see you. Oh, oh, I'll put your mic on as well, Lynn. No, we can really hear you. Two kinds. Susie, thank you. Look, first this morning, we're looking at the rising cost of living, struggling to pay the bills, people around the country, particularly over winter. We're looking at a new survey into power rises and the government's winter energy payment. Will it really make a blind bit of difference to those who really need it? After 10, Australian sonic artist, Lawrence English, encourages us to listen really closely. He's gone around the world recording environments and creatures. And among the clips he'll be playing for us, Tuie and Silver Eyes that he recorded at Carca Point, one of his favourite recordings from around the world, actually. And at 1130, Mike White journalist, best known as, lover of dogs with Cooper, he's written forward to a new book of early New Zealand photographs of dogs. Both of you will be beside. And you're looking at me with those big puppy dog eyes. It's absolutely gorgeous. So those very staged historic photographs, pipes, glasses, that sort of thing, through to dogs on battlefields and some just really delightful canines and their best friend photographs. It's a heart pleaser. That's at 11.30. That sounds lovely. Thank you very much, Lynn Freeman, coming up with 9 to noon shortly. It is now 11 minutes to 9. Well, California's Coachella music festival, caused by the pandemic. A hundred and twenty-five thousand people are expected to attend each day of the two-weekend festival. It's headlined this year by Harry Stiles Billy Eilish, and The Weekend, who you just heard performing his hit single, Blinding Lights. Now, the event taking place with no COVID-19 restrictions regarding masks, testing, and proof of vaccination. Pop music critic at the LA Times, Michael Wood, is with us. Keanu Michael, thanks for being with us today on RNZ National to tell us about Coachella. The biggest acts, the most anticipated act, I have to say there's an awful lot of coverage worldwide about this. It's quite an event. Yeah, it's the world's, I don't know if you could call it the biggest festival. There might be some with more people, but I think it's fair to say it's the most important music festival in the world. A bunch of reasons for that. One of them is comes first in the calendar year, thanks to the, you know, weather here in Southern California, we can have a festival like this in April. And yeah, it kind of sets the agenda, I think it's fair to say, for festival season as it rolls out every year. What are your picks of some of the performances so far? I enjoyed, you know, Harry style. Coachella kind of started as like an alternative rock kind of thing. And over the years, it's kind of gotten closer to closer to embracing mainstream pop. Harry Styles, you know, the One Direction boy band, heart throb was the headliner on Friday night. And that was kind of a big moment for Coachella to sort of embrace that kind of music and he was a lot of fun I mean you know he's he's a boy band pop guy with like the heart of an old baby boomer rock guy a lot of David Bowie a lot of Freddie Mercury energy it was. Billy Eilish was great too. She's such a important sort of figure among Gen Z kids. And it was cool to see someone so young. She was the youngest artist who'd ever headlined Coachella. She's 20. And it was exciting to see someone that young sort of get such a big look at the festival. Now, of course, it's coming after COVID has sort of ravaged its way around the world. What is it like being somewhere like Coachella without any kind of restrictions? It wasn't too unusual. I mean, I was in Las Vegas earlier this month for the Grammys, and that's the same deal there. I mean, no one's wearing a mask in Las Vegas. I think that I'm not saying that everybody in the U.S. has sort of decided that COVID is over. That's certainly not the case. But I think in certain areas, certain places, I think people, you know, for better, for worse, I think people have just decided that they are ready to come back to events like this. You know, I mean, there was a smatter. You'd see a person wearing a mask, one or two a day at Coachella, but for all practical purposes, you could have just experienced this weekend without any idea that COVID had ever happened. You know, I mean, I guess we'll see in the coming days if it turns out to have been some sort of super spreader event. You know, I'll say it's mostly outside. I mean, the vast majority of things that are going on are outside. It's very windy, which, you know, I assume sort of helps in a ventilation kind of perspective. But yeah, definitely not an experience that was like shaped by COVID. Thank you very much. Michael Wood there, LA Times pop music critic at seven minutes to nine. Is there anyone out there? NASA is set to broadcast a message deep into outer space that will tell alien civilizations how to find us and who we are. It's an updated version of a previous message sent in 1974, but using technological advances to give more detailed directions about planet Earth and a fuller explanation of what makes us tick. And as Sandberg is a senior research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute and he's not sure such openness is a good idea. Good morning to you. Good morning. Okay, so let's just give a brief description of how this works basically what's sending numbers and binary code and things like that out into space like a message in a bottle. Something like that. You want to send a message that seems weird enough that this can't be natural. And then you want to use some kind of universal language and hopefully aliens can understand. And the idea is quite often, well, mathematics is probably the most universal thing we know. So you start by giving basic math and then you try to explain some physics. So they are hopefully aware that there is radio otherwise they couldn't get the message that there is chemistry and then you build up a little vocabulary and then finally you get to the main part of the message which is kind of a great thing from earth this is going to take what it takes thousands of years to get to where it's going a cluster cluster of stars in the Milky Way somewhere. What's the danger in this? Are you a bit worried about this? Well, I'm not too worried about it, but I think it is a mildly bad idea, because the problem is, a powerful civilization you might not necessarily want to have them notice that you're on their doorstep. Now, they might, of course, be totally friendly. But if they're not friendly, then you're in trouble. And this will contain a map. It'll have a map, right? They'll know where to go. Yes. And this is a bit of an update on the map that was on the Voyager probes we sent out, but that was just an object. So it's directions and distances to some pausers in the Milky Way and a time measure on when was this done so you know roughly where in the universe this was sent off. Anders, thank you very much for that. Anders Sandberg there, senior research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute. It is about four minutes to nine. Let's go to Canberra and our correspondent, Kerrianne Walsh. Kura Kerriyan, how are you? Very well, thank you, Susie. Oh, good, good. Now, how's that election campaign of yours going? Well, it was a pretty rugged first week. We've got five weeks to go. Anthony Albanese had what is probably one of the worst first election campaigns for any leader. The polls have reflected the stumbles that he suffered last week. News poll this morning, a smattering of polls and other papers over the weekend show that people have marked him down harshly. But with five weeks to go, there's a lot more to be done. And as long as he can just stay the course and make sure that he doesn't, well, one, that he knows his policies for a start. And two, know things like the official cash rate, which one would have imagined most people would know. Oh, well, most people in politics and the economic sphere should know, which is what he's stumbled on last week, one of the many things. Then he didn't have a show because the polls still show that he's well ahead. But Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, is a brilliant campaigner, Susie. So, you know, it's this is a time when they hope the government is hoping that the last three years, which for the government had a lot of errors, a lot of successes, but a lot of errors, will dissipate as people focus on him in the campaign. Yeah, how much of a problem is this for Anthony Albanese? Because he's going to need to kind of wrestle that narrative back, otherwise this could dog him for the rest of the campaign. Well, it could, and he wants to focus on things like health care, like aged care, which is in a shambolic state. I mean, there's going to be a walkout in the last week of the campaign by aged care workers, for instance, because of very poor pay and appalling conditions. And climate, of course, which is a very big thing, which is what a lot of the independence are focusing on. There are so many issues that are swirling around. The Prime Minister is trying to avoid some of the more contentious ones for him and for his coalition. Labor is trying to just, you know, keep two policies and not have any more stumbles. We've got a very, very long way to go. And there's always these wild card issues that fly in through the side door that smack them in the head. Speaking of such things, I see that one of the candidates, I think, hand-picked by Scott Morrison, is giving the coalition grief in a seat. They're trying to win back. Now, this is Catherine Deves. Yes, Catherine Deves, who has made some highly inflammatory statement about transgender people, people who transition. She's compared them to the stolen generation indigenous stolen generation to Nazism there's a lot of florid descriptions that have been now deleted from her social media accounts the Prime Minister hand picked her according to reports this morning he knew she was quotes transphobic when he selected her and he's standing by her. But half his team, his own team, are calling for her to be disendorsed and to a friendly candidate to be nominated. I mean, this is in Tony Abbott's seat, the former Prime Minister, the seat of Waringa. They desperately want to get it back from the independent Ali Stegel, but not with this candidate. They won't cut it. It won't work. Thank you very much. That is Kerry Ann Walsh in from Australia, ending the show for the day. Have a good one. Kiar Paitora. The Three Kings Bellbird, curry mackle."}
