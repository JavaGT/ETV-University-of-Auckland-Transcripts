Lots of kids used to just leave without bothering about qualification. Yeah, well, true. Which is harder to do now. Well, it's harder to get a job without them now, so... I thought about it later, and didn't value education as much harder to do now. Well, it's harder to get a job without them now, so. Thought about it later and didn't value education as much as I do now from my own children. My name's Tony Gilland. I'm the principal of Westland High School here on the west coast of South Island in Hokotiga, a lovely little place that is perhaps one of the world's best kept secrets into paradise. It's indeed how you could describe this place when you're looking at the weather and the white bait and all those wonderful things. We're not a big school, we're a school of 450 odd. This thing is still developing in the front here at this stage and for some you can take up to 22, 23 years old to get this really developed here. School has changed dramatically and it needs to too. I think mostly because the students have changed. The young men and women of this modern generation, they're a new breed of young people who have got a new way of doing things, a new way of looking for the future and sometimes what was done in the past isn't what these kids are looking for. All schools have to adjust to that sort of change and try and find ways of meeting their needs. NCAA, the word stand for national certificate of educational achievement, and that's the key. It's called a national certificate. It is simply a certificate that indicates that a person has reached a particular standard at a given level. There are three levels in high school, but instead of having a single exam, each subject is broken down to a number of standards, some of which are internally assessed, some are by an exam at the end of the year. Each of those standards has a set number of credits attached to it. When you add up to a certain total of credits in NCAA level one, for instance, it's 80 credits in total, eight credits from English, eight credits from math, you awarded National Certificate of Education Achievement Level One, as you would have if you'd passed four exams in school certificate. The NCAA really did transform our curriculum. Under the old system, you would sit a written examination to assess how well you could act. Now you can get up on stage and do it. In science, they're assessed on actually being able to conduct an experiment, not just on being able to write about or other people's experiments. I don't think it takes away any rigour. I don't think that it's easier. They have to be very well organised. They have to think about when they've got deadlines, what their priorities are. They have to work all year. They can't just cram for the exam at the end. But the advantage of that is for many students, by the time they go into their exams at the end of the year, they already have a solid bank of achievement behind them. With NCA, if you fail on one stand, you still have the opportunity to re-sit that paper now, whereas you only ever got one chance at it. I liken an NCA assessment to getting your driver's licence. If you can drive and you can pass the test, nobody's going to care whether it took you a couple of efforts to get there to pass your test. If you can demonstrate the skills for an assessment at NCA, you earn the standard. The extra part added to it now also is that there is a recognition of whether you can do it well or excellently. So you can be rewarded for achieving it. Just reach the standard a little bit better. That is, get it with merit or achieve the standard with excellence. That is that you're really good at that particular aspect of that course. You might be really, really good at writing an essay. You get excellence for that, but you struggle a bit to give a speech. You might just achieve it or you might not even achieve that. But you're still shown that you can do some part of English really well, which wouldn't have shown up in the past. Much truer picture of what those kids can actually do rather than, yes, I got UE or yes, I passed birth three. I'm in Year 10 and I'm about to go into NCA level one next year. I've got some unit standards and maths that have passed. Bridget is enthusiastic, happy and talented young girl who sets herself challenges. We've got a couple of excellences already for maths and that. happy and talented young girl who sets herself challenges. We've got a couple of excellences already for maths and that. You've got a merit, is it? Or you've got the chance of going for a merit for your singing? And her face rises from the crowd. I got to know that Bridget was a singer last year when she was one of the main roles in the school production. And then her and Tessa approached me and talked about doing maybe some of the performance parts of Level 1 music in Year 10. Because it's all done different achievement standards now, so instead of having to do the whole of Year 11 music, she can just do bits of it and the bits that fit in with her timetable. And she can do the other parts next year when she takes music as a subject. She opened a door and in that single smile. Multi-level studies are something where kids can be in year 12 chronologically we might be learning at level 1 or level 3 on the NCA depending on where they're at and we have a number of kids that can be working at all three levels 1, 2 and three within any given year level. But it really refers to a learning level rather than an age level. It's pretty cool to know that I've already started pretty much for next year. So if we can look at her results in those classes to get an idea of possible math, the sciences she can be slotted into based on her results. They're quite detailed now, I think. Yes, no, they're great. They have a nice little graph for the visual people. Yeah, you're registered in 10 credits and you've passed six. She's achieved level one math standards at year 10s. The could well be no two kids doing the same thing at any time throughout a year. It's much closer to that concept of individualized learning. Physiotherapy, if she's interested in that, that would be something that you would want to take phys for something like that. That might cross into science. Yeah, support that science. Absolutely, yeah. So it's sitting alongside them with the parents to try and make sure that they're in the. Yeah, that's what we're taught. So it's sitting alongside them with the parents to try and make sure that they're in the right place, they're doing the right thing, they're in the courses as much as possible that's going to help them reach their goal. We've lost counting how many different jobs you're going to have. We're talking about nine career changes. You're going to retrain nine times. What do you aspire to? Um, not really sure. It's ready to you? Not really sure. It's really going to happen, Zavis. No copy. Michael's got his excellence in Xbox. I'm pretty happy with that. Very happy with that. Michael's a boy. He's a year 12 boys. Whether the boys are any better or worse than they now than they were then is an interesting question. But the girls are certainly a lot better, a lot more focused and a lot more going for it and therefore achieving it probably at a lot higher rate. I would have been involved with films and stuff like that. I would suspect under the old system where it's pretty, cuts right, pretty competitive and it doesn't really relate to what a student was capable of doing. I would suspect he might be getting somewhat disinterested in school around about now. He might be getting a little bit bored and he might be looking towards sort of thinking maybe he's had enough and moving off. We're just making a movie here for their local information centre. Show the tourists what goes on, Hokutika. Show the information centre people. If they like it, they'll put it on display, hopefully. The idea is that it motivates them further to do better in the work that they're doing. Perhaps raise the bar on what they want to achieve because they know that somebody is going to be showing this film in the public in the future. Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to move well up here, we're going to break into the current and then we're going to go and park in by the sand there inside the eddy. So let's move up here. Michael really enjoys his outdoor ed. He's a practical person. He likes getting out there and doing things with his hands. If he were forced to do a straight academic course, there would probably be areas in which he might become disruptive or lose focus because he wasn't doing things that allowed him to be physical. By having those subjects, he's probably more successful in his academic subjects as well. You've got 71 credits at level two. And you've got 20 that have rolled onto level three too. Do you know that? Nope. Oh, you have. And you've got seven literacy have rolled onto level three too. Do you know that? Nope. Oh, you have. And you've got seven literacy. You need an eight. You need one more literacy. They now are taking charge of themselves. And by the time you talk to the year 13s, they're pretty clear up about where they are, where they're going, what they need to do to get there. And they're actually taking pretty good control of where they're going. And that's really important. I think it is taking charge yourself, taking responsibility for your own learning. In the end, is the only way you're going to be able to continue to learn for the rest of your life. I'm just doing an assignment for my at the red class. It's a tramping assignment. And I'm doing it now just trying to get it in before the end of the year. I think it's good really, because you don't have to wait until, you know, end of the year and then just get bombarded with all these exams at the end of the year. I think it's good really because you don't have to wait until you know, end of the year and then just get bombarded with all these exams at the end. The new system seems to certainly help people more, people with different styles of learning. In a way it's a bit more humane than the system that we went through. They enjoy it. They enjoy doing it, they enjoy being at school. I'm Suzanne Yorgerson and I'm the principal of Porreau College. It's a state school, it's Data One-A, Maudiori Pacifica students. A couple of years ago, PC stood for poor children. I wasn't going to send my kids to school at the start. It's been my school for four years now. It was my mom's school. She came here as a student. I got changed to PC stood for pride and courage. You know, the pride to stand up and represent your school and your community and your family. It's a cultural place. I don't know, and everyone knows everyone here. Yeah, it's a good place. There's three levels for NCA. From year 11 to year 13, it does rather dominate their lives. We're going to do the assessment for level one, and he's going to start off with a brief karakia, and then into his co-papa about himself, his family his parents and his school. Foray they're I'm atisi of my teina, Atoahina, and Mosi they're Ihai of my teina. Because he's so quiet, it's fortunate that we do go around monitoring every student, and that's how we picked up Apirana. Apirana's actual dream is to be a doctor, and we've told him that that's a pretty high dream, but we've also told him that, man, we'll push them as hard as we can to achieve it. Tomatoe, yeah. What's my man? Caeufina? Yeah, yeah, you cheat with merit. When I was at school, if you were nerdy, everyone kind of sat the opposite side and made fun. These days, it's kind of cool to have a bit of brains. Yeah. It feels like when you get your first kid, it's just like you're growing up. Yeah. It's like not a little kid anymore, not doing little kiddie subjects. My daughter's, she's okay academically, but I think she would have struggled. I really think she would have found it really hard to get level one. And under the old way, I think she would have given up if she didn't. Like you're climbing stairs, like your first set of credits is the first set of stairs, your second stairs, the next step. And when you pass, that's when you get to the top of the stairs. I like started acting my teachers how much credits I had and how much I needed and what assessments I needed to work on. She went for it. Now that's because she could see it physically in your hand. When I finish school I want to be a teacher. G.C. Skipworth, second in class social studies, personal excellence, physical education. Through the years God has brought us this far. It's amazing to watch my own daughter have aspirations other than doing what used to be the normal in this school. Go work for McDonald's or just not do much. It was a big step away from a convenient assessment system where everybody needed to fit into that bell curve. And the extraordinary belief that it was okay that 50% of New Zealand children failed, you can't have that kind of drop out. You can't have that kind of failure rate. You can't have that kind of failure rate. Being in a Syria ain't an excuse. Not at all. More students go to university now. We're up to about 25% now of year 13. We used to have about three percent. Can the father let you are? All right. Solar energy. So anything that involves electricity, batteries, lights, stuff you plug in. Solar energy. When I was in Form 3, I found, you know, college really boring and not interested at all. Joe had a lot of knowledge when he came to us and he found that the initial course that he did when he came was a little bit frustrating. I was quite naughty back then and I decided to wag all the class that I was, I found boring and because you know I felt that you know if I wag the class and I go study on my own I perhaps get more out of it. He was put into my class at that point and he basically completed the entire year's work in a month. I was put in a high-level class and I was allowed to discuss deeper concepts that I've always wanted to discuss when I was at a younger age with the teachers. And that really helped me develop further thinking, especially in physics and chemistry. When I was Form 5, I actually did subject in three levels. And I also did a scholarship for stats and it felt really good being able to get scholarship at Form 5. So, don't get the scholarship at Form 5. Don't know. That's the only the hope for me is that I can of course be able to specialize and succeed in what I want to study in my own area of interest. But they still feel even more importantly that I still develop my character because they believe that, you know, having a good personality and personal characteristics is still the most important of all. NCA is extremely flexible. I wanted to take classical study because I felt that I had all these sciences going on. If you study the arts as well as these science, it just makes you a more balanced person, I suppose. I was able to take year 13 classical studies without doing anything other than level one English. Last year, the International Young Physics Tournament, those Christians were open and the Christians. And so it all comes down to how creative you are or how much you could think on your own and how well you could discuss with other people, which were skills that I was, I had the privilege to learn at this school. I went to Wur Wilson High School, City, NCO, levels one, two and three there. I employed a lot of people in the last couple of years, young ones, reading through their papers and credits, you do get a good indication of where they're at and just going with the credits he had, the marks he had and straight away that stood out, he sort of above other applicants. It tells you a bit more about the person, if they're at and just going with the credits he had, the marks he had. And straight away, they stood out, he stood above other applicants. It tells you a bit more about the person if they're hands-on or computer skilled or good at fault finding. That's what I see. It just tells you they've done the hard yards at school, really. That's another thing. The training we want to put operators through is to go on to a messy to do a dairy diploma and milk technology. A good thing about NCA, what qualifications I got is I'm allowed to skip the first year there just because of the mess and physics I did so I can go straight into a second year. I'm John Hattie, Professor of Education, the University of Auckland. Well what we looked at was the relationship between the success in the NCEO and success at the first year university. And typically we expect a relationship in my number system of about 0. three on a scale of zero to one. The NCA is more like 0.5.6, which says it's a dramatically better predictor. Students who do well in the NCEA also do well in university. Hi, my name is Olivia Burt. I went to Peckerain College and now I'm at the University of Auckland studying commerce. I've just finished my first year. It's been heaps of fun. There's always people milling round and willing to have a good time. No, I don't spend much time out here hanging out. I spend a lot of time in the library. I'm just trying to do a little bit of study and be ready for when exams come. I really liked NCA. After level one, I decided to pick up economics because graphics hadn't gone very well and so sort of like you need an extra subject. I may as well do economics but then I did really well in the exam and the internals so I decided then that I'd do commerce based on my Macs. Excellence is very proud. I really enjoyed economics. We find that the students who go on and get the excellences, and with the system now where you can have endorsed excellence, there's a major, major push from those students to really optimize their learner. And when we then follow those students through who get excellence in the NCAA into the university system, they still do the very best in their turn to their learner. And when we then follow those students through who get excellence in the NCAA into the university system, they still do the very best in their tertiary qualifications. So the evidence in favour of the NCAA challenging students is just overwhelming to me. The transition from school to uni was very smooth. Under NCAA you're working hard all through the year. So you're always aware of your assessments you've got at the moment and then the next ones and sort of you've got a plan and then you know that there's more coming. And so you're always looking forward, which is quite similar to uni, where everything's mapped out for you and you know when your assessments are and when they're due. Some of the papers I was facing in the second semester were known to be quite a challenge so I felt quite encouraged quite early on to work hard so that I'd pass and not have to repeat them. People be like, hey do you want to have lunch? I'm busy. I spend a lot of time in the library. We expect students now to work right throughout the whole year, to take a lot more control of their learning. So what we're doing in the NCR is mimicking. What happens both in the workplace and in the universities. It teaches them to listen to feedback, it teaches them to actually seek the feedback about what they can and can't do. It teaches them to know what their strengths are, know what their gaps are, and to go about finding ways to fill up those gaps, either by themselves, with their peers, or with their teachers, which is exactly what the university demands of our students. I've been to University of Auckland in the past semester, but however, tomorrow I'm flying all the way to America to go to study at UC Berkeley in California. I'll be studying chemistry and physics, just what I've wanted always to study. That's always been my ambition. I think I'd like to do some third world work like helping set up businesses. I think that would be really cool to be able to make a difference in that way. I think I can do anything. Take on the world. I'm Thank you."}
