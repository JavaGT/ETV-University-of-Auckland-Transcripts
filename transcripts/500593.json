This test was to evaluate the time for ignition for oil cooking fires, to evaluate people's perception of time that can vary significantly. In the first test, we utilised a frypan and a pot, both with lids. We noted that it took over 11 minutes for the fry pan to ignite and 14 minutes for the pot to ignite. In the second test where there was no lid, the fry pan ignited in approximately 6 minutes with the pot igniting in approximately 9 minutes.
