From tomorrow we say goodbye to venue limits and seating rules, and welcome back indoor gatherings. It's hoped Orange will bring a return to a more normal life. But what do we need to do to keep it that way? Pushing Paws on restrictive rules and resuming life as we once knew it. The orange alert setting easing us into a new era and providing a welcome relief to the hospitality and events industries. While cases remain high, hospitalisations are dropping. The government confident we've made it through the worst. The evidence is clear that the actions we have sustained to mean that we're now coming off the peak and we're now well on the other side of it. But when easing restrictions has seen rising reinfection rates overseas, how do we enjoy life under Orange or remembering this outbreak isn't over? And Lynn McBain, head of primary health and general practice at the University of Otago and Wellington is here now. Thanks for your time, Lynn. The move to Orange will be welcomed by a lot of people. Why is it safe to move us now? Well, I think it's probably a pragmatic move to move to Orange now. It does seem like the peak of the Omicron cases are over and hospitalizations have stabilized. So that combined with, I guess, the population feeling that they really want to move on, that's probably the right time to move now. And why do you think the government opted to move the whole country at once and not region by region as they have done in the past? Well, I think it's always proved to be quite difficult to maintain regional borders with varying alert levels and traffic light settings. And especially with Easter weekend coming up, I think it would be terribly confusing for people to know whether they should be sticking with their setting that they had in their home, in their home place or in their, the place they're going for their holiday. Let's talk about masks, Lynn. Schools are allowed to pick whether they have a mask policy. Is this the right call? Well, I think I would have rather the mask policy was left as a requirement for schools. But I can also see that schools are meant to be self-governing. Schools have boards of trustees. Schools serve their local areas. and so I would hope that the schools will make decisions that are appropriate for their local areas and I suppose the good thing too is that the kids are going on holiday so that might help a little bit as well now overseas we've seen reinfection rates rise when restrictions have eased do you think that's going to happen here? I wouldn't be surprised. I think that when the restrictions are eased, most of the population will feel a bit more relaxed about going out and being more in social gatherings and these unlimited numbers of people allowed at gatherings. And naturally, especially with a highly infectious variant like Almacron, and these unlimited numbers of people allowed at gatherings. And naturally, especially with the highly infectious variant like Omicron, infection rates probably will rise. So I won't be at all surprised. Good for people to be prepared for that, and I guess expecting it, not shocked by it. Absolutely. And I guess the other thing for people to be well aware of is people who feel that they are vulnerable. And the elderly, the people with ongoing illnesses or immune suppression, really still have to continue to look after themselves and take as many precautions as they feel they should. Thank you so much, Lynn. Lovely to talk to you. Thanks for your time tonight. Okay, thank you. Bye. ASB in 7-Sharp, keeping you one step ahead. Well, in life, some decisions are more complex, like if and when to have children. Some can, some struggle to, and others simply don't want to. And as times change, so does that conversation and the factors that influence it. The cost of living, careers, relationships, the planet, not to mention a global pandemic. It's all food for thought when weighing up whether to start a family or expand on what you've got. In fact, 2020 had the lowest birth rate on record for Altieroa. Society expectations on women, especially when you hit your 30s, is that you're going to want to have babies or will have babies, but there are a lot of us who don't. Influencer Danielle Duncan isn't shy in getting the conversation started. I'm more leaning towards not having them than having them. So at the moment it's about 80, no, 20% maybe. There needs to be a place for all voices to be heard. And I think this is a very loud and important voice. So has the decision to have children or expand the brood changed course? And for more on this, we're joined by diversity and inclusion consultant Joe Crip. Lovely to see you, Joe. Now, what sort of things are we having to think about these days that we didn't used to have to worry about? Hioara, Kuroa. First off, I just want to acknowledge that there's so many people who would desperately want to have a child but can't. So I just would like to acknowledge that straight up. But my babies now are actually taller than me. So it's been a while since I've been pregnant. But I can remember when I was thinking back, when I think back, we were just struggling to go, how the hell are we going to cover our mortgage? We need two incomes. And what would be having babies mean for me, like my career going forward? And you know what? I was right to think about those things back then, because there's this thing called the motherhood penalty. Like, moms get offered less opportunities. They end up getting paid less and end up getting promoted less. But I tell you one thing I didn't have to worry about, and that was going to the supermarket and wondering if the cost of milk and cheese and all those products were just going to be more. So I reckon inflation and this cost of living must be throwing curveballs to would-be parents and their thinking. Okay, so talking about how many children we're thinking about having. Are these decisions, Joe, decisions that affect women more than men? Unfortunately, they do. It's not called the motherhood penalty for not for a good reason. It's not called the dadhood penalty. It's not called the parenthood penalty. It's actually all the research show that women's income and opportunities are the ones that are impacted. And if you look at the research that's just come out from the Retirement Commission last week, over our lifetime, women will earn 30% less to retire on. So it's not just when we've got these little beautiful babies in our arms, it's the whole workforce and the long-term consequences of having children. So what should we be taking into consideration? Yeah, well, I think the best piece of advice I could ever give is whatever decision you make is going to be the best one for you. There's a huge amount of pressure on us to have babies, but we can also have too many and too few. And then if we don't, we judge. So I really do think that women should do exactly what's best for them. Now, just asking for a friend, Joe, is it ever okay to ask someone if they're planning to have children? Look, Jeremy, I wonder how many men get asked that? And I'll ask you, Jeremy, are you thinking about having any more children? Well, I can't anymore, Joe. That may have back for it. Did I share too much there? Yes, it may have done. No, it's a question that is quite personal to people, and obviously it's very gendered, right? We go straight for the woman, we put all the pressure on her to make the right decision, and that right decision is just going to be the one that's right for her. Thanks, Joe. Great to talk to you. Thanks, team. See ya. So are you telling me that if you come across someone that you know and they look pregnant, they might be eight and a half months pregnant, you can't say, I wish you well with that pregnancy. I wish everything's going to go well. No, well, you shouldn't ask them, as Joe said, whether they're going to have a baby. Equally, if you think they are with child, you should not say anything unless you're 100% sure. Unless you are actually seeing the baby crown, you should say nothing. Because the number of times that people get it wrong, are you pregnant? No, I just had a couple of extra donuts. Okay, that's some good advice. It's the timeless toy that keeps growing in popularity. And while Lego is colourful and creative, it's also pretty pricey. That's where Claire comes in. She's made it her mission to get Lego into the hands of Kiwi kids. Here's Lucas DeYoung. It's school, sort of. A class that's a bit outside the box. It's a lesson in Lego. I never played with Lego as a child. I've reversed and come back as an adult and thought, bugger this, I'm going to spend the rest of my time just playing. And so, after a trip to Denmark, the home of Lego, the art teacher of 20 years quit her job to build the brick pit. I looked everywhere, I couldn't find anything, so I had to make it up myself. Put your hand up if you've got Lego at home. Cool. All right. There's a lot of Lego here, and I'm guessing there's probably a lot more Lego at your house. There's a lot of Lego at my house I'm guessing there's probably a lot more Lego at your house. There's a lot of Lego at my house. I had a room in the house, and then I was kicked out up two years, and then I had to go and build a whole new Lego room at the bottom of my garden. She now travels from school to school giving hands-on experience with a toy that many kids can't get their hands on. Anyone who's a parent knows it's really expensive. It's not accessible for schools, no regardless of how effort your school is. What's better Lego class or science? Lego class. What's better Lego class or PE? Lego class. What's better Lego class or lunchtime? These are the things that kids remember when they go older. They go, I remember we had the Lego lady who came in. The Lego Lady. Are you comfortable with that title? I don't mind it. I don't mind it, yeah. She should probably be called the Equalizer. I use the same packs for a Decile One school as a Decile 10 school, giving everyone an equal opportunity to enjoy it. I never as a child. Lots of people haven't, but if I can give them one opportunity too. And Lego? Wanted nothing to do with it. I have self-funded this whole thing. Every single piece I have paid for myself. Three years it has taken me to source the Lego. 90% of my Lego is secondhand, but that's how I could make this happen for people. It just looks like play to me. I mean, is it the idea that these kids don't even know they're learning right now? Absolutely. Play is all about learning. It's just they don't know their learning. They're learning to be creative. They're learning to do problem solving. They're challenging themselves. They're talking to each other. They're engaging with each other. Because where are the instructions? Nowhere. Nowhere. You just do whatever you want? Just be creative. That's a nice dropper. Even I don't know what they're going to come up with. Every time I'm astounded to see, I'm like, I never thought of that. I'm here, the dastole ate his head off. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah time I'm astounded to see, I'm like, I never thought of that. I'm here the basal ate his head off. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Dinos write the head off. That's always a good one, isn't it? We can't work it out. You're working out, baby. For the time that they're here, you'll probably have 99% engagement, and you've seen it today where they're all engaged in their own world and that's what you want That's what any teacher with any parent wants But the best thing about a Lego lesson that after the creativity Quite a bit of um She does the clean up You definitely got to get the kids on the clean-up. Now, we all know people in the community who've done something great and deserve a bit of recognition, and that's why we partnered with ASB to bring you good as gold.

With aerial acrobatics, theatre and larger-than-life sets, Al-Tiro's only disability-led arts organisation has wowed audiences for 25 years. So to celebrate its silver anniversary and the barriers it breaks, touch compass is bringing you Retaha. Teroharinga Brown is here with a front row seat. Welcome to our 25th anniversary celebration of touch compass. Breaking down barriers to ensure everyone with a passion for the arts has a platform to express it. It's really important, especially for people with disabilities or who identify as having a disability, because of all you ever see is people of a different physicality or a different functionality, then you never really get the idea that that might be something you could pursue. Lucy Vaiyva is an award-winning dancer and proud founding member of Touch Compass. As we climbed up the 20 flights of stairs to the studio on High Street in the City, we were rehearsing for our first dance show ever, was a challenging time to discover things like accessibility is not always easy. This is Lucy's piece, Taupo, a traditional seva, expressed in her own powerful style. We bought awareness of our own unique ways to achieve our creativity in the disability community. Technically, touch compass reached this milestone last year but we all know we're got in the way. As a result, Rita has been live streamed with a small audience present. And spiraling into the year is multi-award-winning Hothipua artist Rodney Bell. Dance found me 25 years ago. He found me through Touch Compass Dance. Cunning was a founding dancer. His piece, The Air Between Us, is a counterweighted duet with aerial choreographer Chloe Loftus. The significance of the air between us is between different cultures. We have the Pākeya, we have the Māori, then we have disability and non-disabled. And it was only because of touch compass that Susan Cohen was able to reconnect with her love of dance. I had a significant shift in my physical status around the age of 22. I saw a performance of Touch Compass in 98. After that show, I went up to the artistic director, Kavan Chappelle, and said, oh, do you have any workshops coming up? And then my whole life went down a different pathway. Her piece, Nottie Entities, is a rope installation performance where she and Amelia Ruby explore restriction, desire and naughty entanglements. It's got this kind of multifaceted approach to performance. There's very much a focus on the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional bringing them together. These three artists have been appointed as the new artistic direction panel for touch compass. The money they bring, the faqaro they bring, the ethnicities we bring, the lived experience, the arohar that we bring together is infectious. That looks absolutely fantastic. Now, wild parties, adoring fans and heaps of eyeliner, yes, we all dreamed of being a rock and roll legend when we were younger. But some people have never stopped dreaming about it, and Ben Hurley is one of them. Forget maths in biology in Epsom, Auckland lies the Kairon Rock School with its own, Jack Black.

Yeah, we're in the heart of it, yeah, yeah, no. So much about rock and roll is the image, the iconography, you know, is that part of the teaching as well? You know, are you going to wear eyeliner?
