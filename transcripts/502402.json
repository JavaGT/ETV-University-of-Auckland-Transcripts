We start with four, but in the end, there can be only one. Tyler Nathan Wong here. We start with four players, but only one can be crowned champion. Who will it be? Let's test them and find out, Chris. Thanks for that, Tyler. And don't forget, you can play from home as well. So let's meet today's BrainBusters! Hello, my, hi-to-my, welcome to Brain Busters. Today we have four players hoping they've got what it takes to be called the ultimate brain buster. We'll start with Mega Memory before we make our way into our specialist subject round where our players can choose from six of our options. They'll hope to gain enough points to stay in this game and avoid elimination. So let's meet our players now. And first up today we have Adele. Welcome to the show Adelele. Now, one thing you're super passionate about is skiing, and you've been doing it for a very long time. How old were you when you started? Four. How on earth were you skiing at just the age of four? I was going down the slopes to my dad's legs. Just shredding down the slopes. That's epic, Adele. Also do a bit of tramping. Favorite place to tramp in Ultherro? Probably my favourite tramp was the Kepler. Beautiful. Thank you for sharing Adele. We also have Will here. Love your dancing. Love your musical theatre. But tell us why, Will. Well, it's just so, you know, free and it's just so fun. And, you know, I enjoy it a lot. So you want to do what you love. Absolutely. Clearly you love Brainbusters as well. You're here on the show. Have you got what it takes to become a Brain Buster champion you love. Absolutely. Clearly you love Brainbusters as well. You're here on the show. Have you got what it takes to become a brain buster champion? Hopefully. Excellent. Well, we have Charlie here who loves football. You live, love, breathe it. Tell me all about football, Charlie. Well, so my dad was brought up near Southampton, and so he supports that club, and I've been watching and playing football since I was like two or three. So I absolutely love it. Great to hear, Charlie. You sound very passionate about it. And who do you play for? I play for Papakura. A big shout out to everyone in your team there. And we also have Gahina on the show. Nahina, when you're not here on Brain Busters or hanging out at school, what do you like to do? I like to watch anime. Excellent. And what's your favourite anime? I know it's a tough question, but if you could only pick one, Nakhina, what would it be? Attack on Titan. Excellent choice. Thanks for sharing, Nahina. And thank you all for being here today to take on Brain Busters. We'll jump into it and play our first round of the day. It's time to play. Mega Memory. Ten points for a correct dancer. Buzz in and get it wrong, though. You are going to lose ten points. We've got 90 seconds on the clock, so plenty of time to score a whole lot of points. Good luck, everyone. Your time starts now. Is Rotorua located in the North or South Island? Charlie. North Island. Can a vegetarian pizza include pepperoni? Charlie. No. How many stars are there on the vegetarian pizza include pepperoni? Charlie. No. How many stars are there on the New Zealand flag? Will. Four. Would you skip stones across water or snow? Charlie. Water. In the nursery rhymes, some sheep were lost by Little Bo Who?

Let's look at the scores after Megamory. Charlie has the early lead with 40 points. Will is on 20. Adele has 10 points and Ngahina has zero points. So now we move into our specialist subject rounds and starting things off today will be Naxena, so what are you going to play? Blue Printer. Thank you very much, Naxena. Let's play, Blueprintter. Naxena, please step forward. All right, Nahina, here is your chance to put the pressure back on everyone else. First going today for our specialist subject rounds, so let's make it count. Good luck, and let's get into Blueprintter. Here it is. Lakes of Western Australia. Your time starts now. Altaro is known for having some pretty epic lakes, but apparently so do our cousins across the ditch. Dumbull Young Lake is one of these and was actually made famous in the 1960s when Donald Campbell broke the water speed record in his bluebird boat, travelling at a speed of 44 kilometers per hour. That's time. 30 seconds on the clock now to put your answers in, which starts now. Halfway. Still 10 seconds there if you want it, but that's okay. Locking them all in. Plenty time left on the board, so Nahina, are you feeling pretty confident about where they are? Not really. Okay, I love the honesty. Shall we just look through it then? Okay, let's get into it. Fingers cross, Nahina. First one please. And we're off to a good start. There we go. That can take off the pressure a little bit. Next one. Lake Wells is also right. Nice work, Nakhina. Unfortunately, not in the right spot there, though. Neither is Lake Moore. What about Lake Tay? Great to finish strong. Yes, absolutely. Nahina, good point. Well done, especially going first for our specialist subject rounds. So thank you for taking on Blueprintter. Nahina jumps into the lead with 60 points. And it's time for our next player to step forward and take on their specialist subject. That player is Adele. So Adele, what are you playing today? Spellbinder. Thank you very much. Adele, let's play Spell Binder. Adele, please step forward. So Adele, time to get into Spellbinder. I wish you the very best of luck. Here comes your first word. Abrasive. A-B-B-R-A. Just one B, sorry, Adele. A-B-R-A-S-I-V-E. Your next word is, lucid. L-U-C-I-D. Correct. Please spell Move. Definition, please. A definition, please. A pale purple colour. M-A-U-V-E. Nice work, Adele. Neighbourly. N-E-I-G-H-B- O, U, R, L-Y. Well done. Fantastic work there, Adel. And your final word, diameter. D-I-A-M-E-T-E-R. Fantastic spelling. Adele, a great round there for you. A little bit of shaking news at the start, but came back super strong. Congratulations and thank you for playing Spellbinder. Adele now jumps into the lead with 90 points. And just like that, we're halfway through our specialist subject rounds. If I, A. Will and Charlie will take on their subjects but of course all of our players are hoping they can head to the brain buster only one player can make it through to amygdala where they turn points into dollars but first they've got to conquer the prato lobe, the web tunnel and the frontal lobe I reckon they've got this I think so too, Tyler. Kiyahara. And don't forget, you can play from home as well. Don't go anywhere. We'll see you. I'm Muria te fakata. Good morning and welcome to Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. Bye, people. Yeah.

I think we're going to be best friends. Let's go. Young Ocean Explorers, Kaintyaki or Temoana, full season streaming now. TV and Z Plus. Chora Anor, welcome back to Brainbusters. Just before the bray, we had Gahina and Adele take on this specialist subject round. And coming up with the front now will be Will. So Will, what are you playing? Sequencer. Great stuff, Will. Let's play. Sequencer. Well, please step forward. Well, then Will, please step forward. Well, then Will, let's get into sequence in now. I wish you the very best of luck. Here we go. Gellon, cup, teaspoon. Arrange these non-metric measures of volume from smallest to largest. Correct. Well, that should settle the nerves a bit. Cruella, Scooby-Doo, 101 Dalmatians. Arranged these movies by their year of release, earliest to latest. All great movies, but is it the right order? Unfortunately not, sorry, Will, it is 101 Dalmatians first back in 1961, then Scooby-Doo in 2002 and Cruella in 2021. Singapore, Palmerston North, Cairo. Arrange these places by average yearly rainfall, lowest to highest. Correct answer. Well done, Will. Frieda Carlo, Vincent Van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci. In what order were these artists born? Earliest to latest is Will right Will is correct and finally Or strong Get Gone Will is correct. And finally. Or strong. Get gone if it's long. Arrange these words to form civil defences advice for people in tsunami zones when an earthquake strikes. If it's long or strong, get gone and get a whole lot of points. Will, well played. Thank you for stepping up to take on the challenge. Will now grabs on to first place with 100 points. And we have just one player remaining to take on their specialist subject round today. That player is, of course, Charlie. So Charlie, what are you playing? I'm playing identifier. Go to Charlie. Let's play Identifier. Charlie, please step forward. Now, Charlie, let's get into Identify. Very best of luck to you, here we go. Remove the three markings commonly found on breeds of cow. Very close to start off with Charlie. Had black and white, had brown, also needed red and white. Eliminate three geometric shapes with no straight sides. Super quick to lock that one in. Let's take a look. Nailed it. Remove three features you do not usually see on a weather map. Correct. Birds, mammals, fish. Order these creatures by the number of living species in the world, from fewest to most. That's the right answer, Charlie. Great stuff. And to finish off, identifier, Australia, Europe, Asia. Arrange these continents by area from largest to smallest. And that is the right answer to finish things off for Identifier. A great effort. Thank you very much for taking on the Wiro. Charlie takes back the lead with 120 points. Will has 100 points. Adele is on 90 points and Gahina has 60 points. So unfortunately we do need to eliminate our first player today on Brainbusters and I'm sorry to say, Nahina, that is you. The great news for you though. You get to take home a $50 bank account, so what are you going to do with the money? Save it for a new phone. Excellent choice, there, Gahina. Thank you very much for playing Brainbusters today. And a big congratulations to our three remaining players for them. It's one step closer to the Brainbuster. Our three remaining players must stay focused if they want to get to amygdala. Getting to the Brainuster will be a challenge but I'm sure they're ready for this. Yeah absolutely right Tyler and also ready for the brain teaser which is what we're heading into right now so all of our players today have gone through their specialist subject rounds and we're left with two options for them to choose from. Today those options are Equaliser and Rio Rongotera. So Adele, Will and Charlie, please vote for which one you would like to play now. Thank you all for your votes. Firstly, let's take a look and see what Adele has selected. It is Equalizer. Will would like to play. Equalizer also. And Charlie would like to play. Equalizer. Our vote is unanimous. Let's play. Equalizer also. And Charlie would like to play Equalizer. Our vote is unanimous. Let's play Equalizer. 30 points separate our players and with 30 points up for grabs for each equation, this is very much anybody's game. Let's get into it now. I wish you the very best of luck. It's time to play the brain teaser. 34 multiplied by 2 plus 48 equals. Will. 124? It's incorrect. 116 was the answer required there. Next equation. The square root of 81 subtract 16 equals. Charlie. Negative 7. Spot on. 30 points to you, Charlie. Negative seven. Spot on. 30 points to you, Charlie. Well done. And finally, for Equalizer. 67. Subtract 43. Divided by six. Equals. Four. It is four. divided by six equals four it is four and that completes the brain teaser thank you all for taking on the challenge let's now have a look at the final leaderboard Charlie now has 150 points Will is on 100 point and Adele has 90 points. So Adele by just 10 points, I'm sorry to say you have been eliminated from Brain Busters. It was a very close game, but still you do get to take home a $75 bank account. So what are you going to do with that? Probably to say that I don't know what to, though. Fair enough. Keep it for a rainy day. That's the main thing, Adele. A big thank you to you for coming onto Brainbusters today. And congratulations to Will and Charlie for them. It's now onto the Brainbuster. Our final two players think they can blast through the Brainbuster. Let's see what the ultimate obstacle course has to say. Right after the break. Yodah!

Entering the Brain Buster is Will and Charlie. Who's gonna come away with a dub? Both boys out of their harnesses and skyrocketing down the neurotransmitter. Wow, awesome feet, Charlie. Will's got the coat, but can he remember it? Charlie's right on his heels and both boys go through the Corpus Colossum. Entering their coats now into the hippocampus, boom! Down goes Will's wall. And Charlie's is close behind. It's a race up the prial lobe. Who gets there first? It looks like Will. He's now through the web tunnel. But watch out. Here comes Charlie. He's right on his heels. Will now on the frontal lobe and making his way to the DNA ladder. Great stuff, Will. You've got this, Charlie. Wow, Charlie, that was fast. It's now neck and neck. Who's getting that green light? Is it Will? It's Will. He's done it. Great stuff, Will. Wow, that was an epic jump. One more under for you. Great racing, Will. Here comes Charlie now. Way to go, buddy. You were quick, too. Congratulations for finishing the Brain Buster. Blink, and you missed that. Two absolute speedsters on the Ultimate Obstool course. Will and Charlie, well done. That was a very quick effort from both of you. Charlie, we'll start with you second place, but you still absolutely flew through the course. What did you think of it? It was really good. That's the main thing. Heaps of fun? Yeah, definitely. Excellent. Make it even better for you. A $100 bank account now belongs to you. What are you going to do with that? I'll probably just save it up. Fair enough. Charlie, great effort today. Thank you for playing Brain Busters. Thank you. Well, congratulations. You are today's Brain Buster champion. As I mentioned, a very, very fast raise. How on it do you get through there so quickly? I have no idea.

And congratulations once again on being today's Brain Buster champion, the final round. It all comes down to this. Yeah. Don't have to worry about a race. Don't have to worry about other players.
