I'm Bernadine Oliver Kirby, and you're with AM early this Tuesday. The Prime Minister has landed in Singapore, touching down last night on her first overseas trip since the COVID pandemic began. Jacinda Adirn flew via Australia on an Air Force Boeing 757 and was greeted by Singapore Prime Minister Indrani Raja. In the coming days, Adirn will spend time with Singaporean and Japanese prime ministers discussing security, particularly concerns over China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. There are also light-hearted activities planned including pavlover cutting, rugby promotions and even a visit to the Japanese cookie time factory. State Highway 3 near New Plymouth has reopened after police fatally shot a man on Saturday night. The scene examination has been completed, but a number of other investigations are ongoing. It comes after 22-year-old Chaos Price was shot and killed by police three days ago. The assistant commissioner revealed officers pulled over an associate of Price before Price himself drove past, turned around and rammed a police car. What happened afterwards remains unclear with no further information being released. The search for a fisherman missing off the east coast near a portiki will resume this morning. The man was reported missing after failing to return home on Sunday afternoon from a fishing trip at Torere in the Bay of Plenty. The search area stretches from Torere to Makkah 2. Police are asking people to keep an eye out for items such as a 100-liter chili bin, wooden oars and a yellow life jacket. Coast Guard, surf life-saving and rescue helicopters are expected to join the search today. School holidays are in full swing, but it could mean more than just students are taking a break. COVID-19 experts believe case numbers could dive in the next fortnight as classrooms are locked and people spend more time outside. However, with winter looming, modeler Dionne O'Neill believes New Zealand needs to start preparing for a second wave. I would expect at the end of this first wave that about half of the population would be infected. And that's a little bit concerning because if we don't know how many infections they've been, then we don't know how to model for reinfections and the waning immunity coming from those infections, so it makes it really hard to do modelling for a second wave. There were just over 6,000 cases on Monday with a further 11 deaths. Russia's assault on Ukraine has spread to its western border as missiles hit the previously untouched city of LaVue. At least seven people have been killed in a series of Russian missile strikes, becoming the first civilian victims in the western city. It comes as Ukrainian officials warn that threats of an attack on the country's east are now becoming a reality with more missile strikes reported in Hakeev. United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths says despite ongoing efforts to stop the violence, he isn't optimistic. Obviously, we have not yet got humanitarian ceasefires in place on the Russian side. I went into a lot of detail on this, and they continue to promise to get back to me on the details of those proposals. Meanwhile, Russian efforts to take the Port City of Murray-Upole are ramping up, trapping nearly 100,000 civilians in the city. 10,000 troops have been deployed to Durban in South Africa as the desperate hunt for flood survivors enters its second week. Historic rainfall carved through the villages and cliffside's early last week, washing out roads, homes and entire city blocks. The death toll stands at 443 with more than 60 people still missing. Authorities say police dogs are amongst the latest recruits in the ongoing search with locals saying the minutes feel like ours. Things are really bad here. We've found a son who has been taken to the morgue and we are confused about what to do with his remains while we haven't found his mother. We think she's been swept away. It's hoped a fresh rescue crews will be able to reach more remote areas. In sport, Kiwi Squash ace Joelle King has been crowned Manchester Open Champion after a dominant display against top seed Sarah Jane Perry. The 33-year-old opened the match in terrific form-taking the first game in just nine minutes before continuing that momentum onto the second game. After trailing in the third, King clawed her way back to win in straight games as she picked up her first title since 2019. The West Tigers have finally recorded their first win of the NRL season with an epic 21-20 upset victory over the Parramatta Eels. With the scores locked at 20 at all, time ticking down on the clock, playmaker Jackson Hastings launched a 38-meter field goal to clinch a one-point victory. It was incredible. Hastings' efforts stunned the crowd and helped lift the tigers off the bottom of the ladder. Pressure off the coach too. The central pulse have bounced back from their loss last week, thrashing the magic 5239 to pick up their third win of the A&Z Premiership season. The pulse were dominant from the start right to the finish thanks to some sharp shooting from Alia Dunn and a solid defensive effort from Captain Kelly Jury. Despite missing their full front-line team, The Magic can take some positives away from the match with Silver Ferns shooter. Amelian Ecanacio playing her first full match. All right, let's take a look now at the weather right around the country this Tuesday. Tomorrow's weather, brought the country this Tuesday. Tomorrow's weather brought to by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. There are heavy rain warnings to start the short week. An orange heavy rain warning is in place for Coromandel Peninsula, up to 120 millimetres of rain is expected and thunderstorms.

Additional government funding has been announced to help farmers with their integrated farm and environmental plans. Joining us now with more as Ag First Managing Director, James Allen. Morena, good morning to you, James. Good morning, Bernie. How are you? I'm great, thank you. This funding is being channeled to a careers pathway scheme from MPI. What's the motivation behind that and how does it best serve the industry? Sure. So MPI have recognised a couple of things. Well, firstly, farmers have made enormous strides in the past few decades in looking after environmental stewardship of their farms. But the rate of change and acceleration of change in complexity for farmers past few decades in looking after environmental stewardship of their farms. But the rate of change and acceleration of changing complexity for farmers is really increasing. So MPI have introduced a career pathway scheme to help build capability and capacity in the rural sector to help farmers work through the complexity of some of these rules. So integrated farming or farm planning, it sounds like it covers a lot of ground. What kinds of areas will benefit or be educated? Sure. So an integrated farm plan really looks at all facets of the farm business. So it's fine to make environmental improvements on your farm, but we need to make sure that the farm remains profitable, it remains safe there, and the people are being looked after. So it looks at all of those facets in the farm business. And as I say, with the rules becoming a bit more complex over the last few years, just the skill set that is required to do this really well is increasing. So this fund will help build capacity by employing a few more people in the sector to do this. So this fund will help build capacity by employing a few more people in the sector to do this. So it's getting everyone on the same page by the sounds, but plenty of rules and regulations in farming as you allude to. Are they becoming too complex, too restrictive? Some of the rules are becoming quite complicated to unpack. So really this is what this fund is going to help, as I say, build capability in the sector so we can unpack them and take them back at the farm level so they're practical and so farmers can understand how they're going to implement some of these rules without getting themselves into trouble. So look, I see this as a great initiative, to be honest. I think it's going to have some long-term benefits for the industry. Because farming is not just a one-man game anymore. It's about creating a team of people around you. The farmer, the advisor, the vet, the banker, the accountant, and creating that team approach. James, it seems as if there were perhaps a few less challenges in the compliance area, the less need for the government to have to throw money in this kind of area? Or is it simply just a sign of the times? I think what's happening, Bernie, is the rate of acceleration of change of the rules has increased. And, you know, what defines a wetland these days? You know, can I run stairs or heifers on my block? How much nitrogen can I apply? And so none of these rules were around a few years ago. So certainly the complexity is there and the good old challenges of running the farm business haven't gone away either. So it's making sure we're doing the right thing for everyone here. So money-channeled on this area welcomed by the red bands on the ground? I'm sure we'll see that trickle-down effect over the next few years, and if it means that farmers can help, we can help them manage their farms better, and they can get on with the business of farming, I'm sure they'll be very happy about that. Yeah, a great business tool for their business. Ag First Managing Director, James Allen, thanks for your time this morning. To international news now and Easter weekend in the United States has seen four major shootings take place. Have the US and the world accepted this as an everyday occurrence despite the shocking consequences of these incidents? Well, to tell us more, I'm joined by AMUS reporter Lachlan Cartwright. Good morning to you, Lachlan. Good morning. Horrendous news of these shootings over what should be a peaceful Easter break for everyone. What can you tell us about them? Yeah, indeed. It was Passover here and Easter weekend, but it was a bloody one. Sad to report that. Four major shootings, including one in the party in Pittsburgh, where two teenagers were shot dead, 10 were injured. We also had incidences in Portland and South Carolina. Now, all these incidences are different in nature, but they do have one through line, and that is guns. And this comes back to the same issue that every president in this country has had to grapple with. It is about gun control. Now, President Biden has talked tough on guns, like every other president. We've had over the last several years as these shootings have increased. Now, one of the interesting things that occurred during the height of COVID is that there were almost no mass shootings or shootings of any nature due to curfews and lockdowns and the fact that there weren't mass gatherings. But as more people have started to emerge and more people have started to gather and socialise coming out of the last two years, we have seen an increase in this. And it is going to be interesting to see if there is any movement on a political front to combat it. Incredible timing when Biden really has just made a statement about trying to toughen up on the gun laws. So it seems like it's fallen on deaf ears. Let's turn our attention to Trump. He just can't let go. Tell me they're not printing the caps and the t-shirts and blazing with Trump 2024 already. Oh, you know they are and you know they have been for quite some time. He is on the comeback trail. There is no doubt about that. Every weekend down at Mara Lago, I watch with fascination to see who is down there, who is associating, who is coming down to kiss the ring. Roger Stone, one of Trump's confidence was this week caught on tape, this weekend caught on tape bashing, one of Trump's main rivals for 24. That's DeSantis. The polls show us that Trump right now is a career frontrunner and it is only gathering more steam for a Trump 2024 run. And I would not be surprised at all in the next few weeks if we start to see more people, more Republicans, start to come out as we head to the midterms and really start to pump him up. We thought it was a crazy notion the first time around, didn't we? But is it fair to say that Trump has some serious legal issues to work through before attempting to pose any real political threat? Look, you know, some of those legal issues that have been reported on and written about, or at this point, almost dead in the water. There was a probe here in Manhattan by the Manhattan DA into some allegations about tax fraud. That's almost just gone quite. There's some civil matters, but in reality, there is a clear run for him. And the appetite, particularly if you travel outside of sort of, I guess, what anyone would label, the coastal elite towns, such as where I am in New York and where I just was a few weeks ago in Los Angeles, if you go out into the flyover states, they are very much still of the opinion. The election was rigged, would you believe? They are very much of the opinion that people were justified in storming the capital on the sixth because the election was rigged. And they very much want Trump back. And so I think we're only going to be talking more on this program between now and 24 about Donald J. Trump. I have absolutely no doubt. Never a great look though when your major accountancy firm dumps you and leaves you high and dry. Look, the new Spider-Man movie, I've seen it, I absolutely loved it, I wouldn't go 300 times, or nearly 300 times, I've got to admit. I wouldn't either, but a bloke by the name of Romano Alanis has just done that to set a new world record. And good on him. He's spent $3,400, would you believe? He watched this over what is equivalent to 720 hours or 30 days. I haven't seen the movie, but I've seen pictures of Romano Alanis in his Spider-Man get up, and boy, is he a super fan? He sure is, and he's, as you say, spent $3,500 to do that, and that's contributed to $1 billion at the box office. If I can give you the tip, go see it. I'm not a massive Spider-Man fan, but there's a bit of a bonus in this movie, and it's pretty good, so there's my little top tip for you. Looking forward to getting the popcorn out and take your peek. Not as many times as Romano though. No way. That is commitment or a little bit of crazy. Cup of crazy.

Please give generously to the poppy appeal this April. Norma, Hoki Ma, you with AM Early. It is seven minutes to six. Time now to check in with our reporters around the country. And first of all, it's Morena to Jasmine. And good morning to you, Jasmine. An Auckland fashion store facing the prospect of having to close its doors. Yes, that's right. New Market's Lejos fashion store is considering closing its doors after two break-ins and two days over the Easter weekend. The robbers took expensive items such as handbags, sunglasses, shoes and clothings, with the owner afraid it could put an end to her business. Now, she says COVID-19 has been a struggle enough but doesn't want to close her doors which have been open for 31 years just because of thieves. This comes after two other luxury fashion stores in Auckland were ramrated last week. Gucci and Louis Vuitton on Queen Street were the ones targeted. Now business owners are aware of an apparent increase of burglaries since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They're saying luxury stores seem to be more organised. Now, but if you are in the market for a luxury item, it's probably a good idea to double-check exactly who you're buying off. Yes, indeed. You don't want to be picking up goods that are hot to trot. Thanks for that, Jasmine. Let's check in now with Mitch Redmond and Christchurch. Othotahe. Seems like Shrekopo no longer on the run. We're all relieved. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. Look, the Easter bunny may have come and gone without too many sightings over the weekend. But Shrekopo, the sheep from Lake Tequipur, perhaps wasn't so lucky. After being on the run for four years, he was finally captured last Thursday by Emily Goodman on Mount Edward near Snowden Station. Now hundreds gathered at Lake Tequipur's Easter Monday market yesterday to see Shrekopor be shorn for the first time. And he ended up losing a whopping 18.6 kilograms of wool. Now Shrikipur has become a little bit of a cult figure in the Mackenzie District over the past four years, with plenty of sightings, but nobody being quite fast enough to actually catch him. And Snowden Station, where Shrekopur is staying now, will become his official home. He spent his last night there last night with Sue, one of the workers, saying that he had a big feed for dinner and spent the first night in one of their sheds. But with it being one degree in Lake Tequipur right now, I imagine it was a pretty chilly night for Shrekopo first up. No doubt. And losing nearly 19Ks in a haircut, I'd say that's goals, wouldn't you? Yes, you would. That's AM early. Jasmine and Mitch, our reporters, that's AM early. It is now four minutes to six. The team's here."}
