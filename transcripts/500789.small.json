We need to provide these children with emergency food, medical care and fresh clean water. Please call Save the Children on O800- triple 694. Or go online at Save the Children.org.org and give just $5 a month. If we don't act now, the situation will only get worse, and more children will die. Please, will you help them? Thank you.
