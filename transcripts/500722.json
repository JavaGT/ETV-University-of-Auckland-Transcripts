First time, it's Mitch Redmond in Christchurch. And welcome to Auckland's world of hurt. Mitch, I'm going to let you break the news to everybody in Christchurch. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. I know all the talk over the past 24 hours or so has been around the orange light, but I just want to switch the attention back to red just for the moment. I'm not talking about COVID traffic lights, though. In fact, physical traffic lights. Two red camera lights have arrived in Christchurch, the first in the South Island. And from next Thursday, we'll start dishing out $150 fines to drivers failing to stop. Now, the Christchurch City Council and Canterbury Police have named the two locations. from next Thursday we'll start dishing out $150 fines to drivers failing to stop. Now the Christchurch City Council and Canterbury Police have named the two locations. The first being the intersection of Moor House Ave and Madras Street and the other being Moor House Ave and Manchester Street. There's been more than 100 crashes at both of these intersections with some of those being fatal toes. So that's the reason that NZTA has chosen these locations for the red camera lights. Like I said, they will be switched on next Thursday, so it may be a good chance for Canary Motorists to think twice about running that risky orange light. Look it as a safety measure, but I cannot believe Christchurch has not had a red light camera. It's basically how Auckland pays for its roads. Not that we have good roads. Anyho, thanks for that, Mitch. Let's go to Ashley McCall and Wellington and the Capitol back on the recycling bandwagon. Yeah, that's right, Bernardine. So glass recycling collections will start back up again on Monday. But the council is asking residents to drip feed their stockpiles. This is because like everything else, Code has impacted our waste services for over a month now and our drivers aren't immune to the Omicron variant either. So they're on the road to recovery, they are raring to go and the council estimates that they're expecting that we're going to see high levels of glass. They don't want to inundate the processing plant. So to help manage the load, they're asking people to take their glass recycling out in stages, or alternatively, to take it to the recycling centre at the southern landfill. They're also reminding residents to check the recycling calendar to see when recycling is due for pickup on their street and remember to clean the glass. I can imagine, though, after yesterday's announcement, there's probably going to be a lot of glass around the capital. Absolutely, and you don't want to miss recycling. You're getting to a world to hurt without that. I'll tell you what we are going to miss. We're going to miss you, Ashley. It is Ash's last day with us. She's leaving us. We want to thank you so much for all you've done for our program and the AM team wishes you all the very best with your next move, Ash. Thank you. We will miss you. All right, let's head now to Nat's Levy in Auckland. Nat's a digital platform for the good old-fashioned lazy Susan. I love a good bit of food chat. Yeah, it's positive social media news, can you believe it? Facebook group Lazy Susan, which is a sharing platform aimed to hype up local knowledge and local eateries with some free publicity that's all positive, is becoming and started a new group Lazy Susan travels. Now the original platform Lazy Susan was where you could go on and you could say, for example, I'm out for a cafe lunch in Gleninus. Where's the best place for coffee? And then members of the group will put in their local knowledge, hype up the staff and put in as much positive detail as possible, because in conversation is encouraged. So Lazy Susan Travels has now launched so that people can go around the country and even internationally as borders open and hype up just some really good local eateries. So it's Lazy Susan kind of reinvented for now. I absolutely love that. Thank you to our AM reporters. That was AM early. It is Friday. Welcome to the show. This is Thursday. It feels like Friday. Pick it up. That's a great start. It feels like Friday. We at the club last night, were you? No, I wasn't at the club last night. Although I did drive down K Road this morning to see whether anyone was out bogeying or partying and I saw nothing. Did you see the moon on your way to work though? No. It's huge and really bright. Well, it certainly was when I was driving in. It's not quite a full moon. But it was like a big disco ball up there for the first night of dancing. You know, you've seen the moon before, right? It's normally round and bright. This is not the first time you've looked into the sky at night time. No, but you couldn't miss it. It's really quite stunning. Maybe it's a super moon. That's next month. Ah, you know your moons. Turns out she knows it moons. Now, this morning when we got into our, we're very close today, aren't we? Are we normally this close? Is that awkward? Or is that okay? Well, we're allowed to dance together now you want to. But we don't. Rubbed up on each other. I look forward to that. This morning in our dressing rooms there was a little chocolate treat left on the couch and I wondered, hmm. Like a real chocolate treat, that's not a metaphor for something. No, it's not. Like it was an egg? It was an egg, yeah, no, no, it was a chocolate Easter egg and I thought who could possibly have done that and the only person I thought of was you, Bernie, was it you? Might have been? Maybe. Thank you, it's very nice. We'll be a little sweet treat, don't we? Happy early Easter. Yeah, but we didn't get you anything, that's all. My hips, thank you for that. Well, thank you. That's very nice of you. Right, it is 6 o'clock coming up on the show this morning. The orange light floodgates are open for hospitality. People are free to pash on the dance floor, as Chris Hickin said yesterday, mask-free. But to visit a shop, you still need a mask. Why? Chris Hickens is live after seven. Also this morning, Cyclone Feli has been and gone, leaving a sodden east coast in its wake. We'll check in on the Hammond region with the Gisbon Mayor. That's just before seven. The Reserve Bank has cranked up the OCR again. With mortgage rates, sure to follow. We'll get some advice from a mortgage broker on what to expect later in the show. Plus day two of the messy Johnny Depp Amber Heard defamation trial is underway in the States. Our man in L.A. Sam Rubin will have all the details about the high profile names involved. That's up to 6.30. It's time for the news. After muddy 8, 6 o'clock. Excited punters have spent the morning in clubs as our traffic light settings change to orange overnight. Video posted by popular Auckland student club Bar 101 shows lines down the street as people waited for the return of dance floors at midnight. The change to orange means limits on indoor gatherings have been dropped, along with the need to remain seated and distanced. Hospitality Association President Nick King told News Hub live at 8, things are moving in the right direction, but the bounce back will take time. Recovery's long, the confidence is there. We just need to continue doing what we do really well, getting people back, passion on the dance floor is a good start. He says the call to remove masks in bars and restaurants was well overdue. But the Greens say now is not the time to his restrictions. They're concerned New Zealand's littlest Kiwis will be most at risk as mask wearing becomes voluntary at schools. Kailita Marama Davidson told AM early, you just have to look overseas to see mask rules being reinstated as case numbers grow. We've seen that not just in the States, actually. It's also in Canada and other parts of the world, where they loosened mask restrictions, particularly in schools where all of our young and unvaccinated children are. And so that has seen the rise of another outbreak of COVID cases. And we can actually avoid that. The already flood damaged Gisbon and Wairo districts are dealing with more grief as cyclone fairly continues to batter the region. Several homes spent the night without par, while many remain cut off by damaged roads. A flood warning is in place for the Hookawai River and with two districts remaining under a red weather warning. Emergency management minister, Kitty Allen, will be in Wiredore this morning to assess the damage. Joe Biden has doubled down on claims that Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. The comments have been faced with fierce criticism from the Kremlin. A spokesperson appeared on Russian radio, calling the comments distorted and unacceptable. But the U.S. President has escalated his rhetoric in return. Literally, it's a horrible thing that the Russians have done in Ukraine. We're going to only learn more and more of devastation. And we'll let the lawyers decide international of whether or not it's qualified. It sure seems that way to me. Meanwhile, Maripol's mayor is warning that Ukraine's troops barely hanging on. It comes as the Kremlin Krams, more than a thousand Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered to Russia in the port city. In sport, the Wellington Phoenix have strung together back-to-back wins in the A-League, edging bottom of the table, Perth Glory 1-0. Mexican midfielder, Gail Sanderval, broke the deadlock for the Phoenix early in the second half as they held on for their fourth clean sheet of the season. While it wasn't their best performance, Coach Ufuktale is pleased to have picked up an important three points before heading home. I played a lot of games back to back. It wasn't a complete performance, but I think it was a good enough performance to get the job done and get the three points, and I think the boys will be pretty excited to fly back on Friday. The Phoenix returned to New Zealand tomorrow as they look to play their first match on home soil in more than 300 days. The Crusaders are desperate to defend their winning streak at home against the Blues, but are wary of the threat their Auckland rivals pose ahead of tomorrow's clash. The Blues sits second on the Super Rugby Pacifica ladder, while the Southerners are behind in third. Crusaders coach Scott Robertson admits the 18-year beat, unbeaten run against the Blues in Christchurch is a source of pride at the club. We know every game has got its own narrative and this one's another special one in the history and the chapter of it and again needs it, super rugby needs it. Game kicks off at 5 past 7. Tomorrow night it'll be a cracker. Finan at 6, Spanish authorities have destroyed 415,000 hemp plants after finding what's being described as Europe's biggest cannabis plantation with around $160 million. Some of the plants were already being dried in a warehouse for processing. The rest of the plantation, look, it's a plantation, was spread across 11 fields with a combined area of 67 hectares. Three people were arrested in the operation. They were thought to be planning major exports to Italy and Switzerland. Among other countries, I'd imagine. That's the very latest from News Hub. It's five past six. Thanks very much, Benadine. Easily confused, apparently, hemp and cannabis, is it? Yes. Now, raise your hand if you're confused about where you can and can't wear a mask. Yeah. It's a grey area, isn't it? And I think it might even include the COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, because when asked about the masks, this was his response. So we're still encouraging them on flights in public transport. Give me one minute. I've just got masks are still a requirement on public transport, so including flights. You don't have to wear a face mask to the supermarket anymore? No. I do have the updated list now and I refreshed my memory of them and I was incorrect on retail. So if you just give me a few minutes, the advice will come through. I'll be clear on that. Just triple check that I'm correct and I'll come back to you on that. Oh, I mean, just you kind of feel for him, don't you? Not his finest moment. I feel bad for him. I feel bad for him. I of feel for him, don't you? Not a finest moment, really. I feel bad for him. I feel bad for him. I do feel for him. But also, if you're the COVID-19 response minister and you can't instantly recall when you can and can't, it shows there's some inconsistency there, right? Because you can take your mask off on a dance floor, but you can't in the supermarket. And this is why. So you can have people passing on a dance floor, but I have to wear a mask to go to the supermarket. At the moment you still have to wear a mask in a retail environment, that is correct. Where is your logic on that? Ultimately it's a question of volume. There are going to be a lot more people in the supermarket on a weekly basis and there'll be out and about patching on a dance floor. So all of a sudden retail has become a concern in terms of spread, but retail has been open for such a long time, much longer than clubs and bars, because we were told that there was minimal spread there. So it's very confusing. So we're going to speak with the COVID-19 response minister a little later on, also speaking with retail and Z. But what I really thought was interesting from that press conference yesterday was there was no mention of the rules for people with COVID or their household contacts. No review of that. And so currently, you still have to isolate for seven days if you have COVID and if you're a household contact. I say, if you're a household contact, cut that back to three days now. Yeah, chop that down. Chop that tree down. I'm with you. Because you know I spent seven days at home because of COVID. And also my partner then has to spend time at home, even though they don't necessarily have COVID. Silly. Also, because you can rat test now. So, you know, I mean, it's widely available. So you can find out whether you're negative if you're a household contact and go about your life. I mean, yeah, cut it down to three days. I feel like we're going over the same stuff, which is actually common sense. And that's the frustrating part, as we can see what the quick fix is. Everyone wants to be safe. Is it not at someone's discretion if they want to wear a mask in the supermarket? I probably would. No, because you can't make decisions for yourself anymore, Gurney, because somebody has to do it for you. That's the world we're living right now. It's really sad. Hopefully we'll get over this. Move past it. Do you think it's time to cut self-isolation down, particularly for household contacts, and will you still wear a mask, even in places you don't have to? Feedback atamshow.com.n.z. Get in touch for us. Head to William now. William, that is beautiful lit statue there behind you. At the mare. Good morning. It's a brisk dart down here in all tootahi crushions. I'm just trying to navigate my way through this minefield of duck feces because William in the dark, we've got a couple of eels down here. I don't know if you can see them and they're wiggling around in the riverside just in the CBD in Christchurch. How good is that? My uncle, my uncle Pangu Pong would have a field day in here with his gaff. Hey, let's check out the weather around the motu. The weather bad for hats. Great for making power. At Rudion we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Cyclone Philly has passed by the east coast, East Cape and forecasted to move south eastward away from the North Island. Heavy rain and severe southwest gales for the east coast means weather warnings are in place for the region. Keep an eye out throughout the day for any updates. Now let's head to the rest of your weather. The Lower South can expect a fine day with a frosty start to the day for some parts of the region. Ote-Poti-Daneran, 19 degrees, and Oamaru on 16. To the west coast where it's a fine day with light winds and evening cloud. Peelpeau-Tahee, Melford Sound, 17 degrees, and Kawateri, Westport, 19. In Canterbury and Malbara, it'll be a foggy start for some on an otherwise fine day for the region. Christchurch will totahi 16 degrees and Tehwai Hararekeke-Blenum on 18. To the lower north where it is also a fine day with any winds down out by the evening. Tefangunui atara, Wellington on 15 degrees and Papuaoia Palmerston North on 18. Now to the central plateau where you two are in for a fine day, Fonganui on 18 degrees and Taupor 17. To the east coast where those weather warnings are in place for Gisbon, Wairoa and the Hawks Bay. The rest of the region is in for a fine day. Taira Fiti, Gisbon, on 17 degrees and Rotorua, 19. And to the top of our country, Aaltearoa, you two are in for a glamour day with fine weather, Damaki, Macaura, Auckland and Fitianga, both on 20 degrees. I wanted to make a massive shout out I had dinner last night with Joe and Snow a beautiful couple who said they really enjoying the show and they made they pointed out my roller skating from a couple of weeks ago and she said she just cracked up laughing was rolling around in the early hours of the morning at that so thanks Joe and Snow lovely to see you guys last night and eat the salmon together. That's nice. Where did you catch up with them? Did you just bump into them at the restaurant, William? Yeah, me and Leon, guy just behind the camera, we had a candle lit dinner and right next door to us was Joe and Snow. They said, oh, what's the weather doing tomorrow, around the Motu? I said, oh yeah, yeah. And we had a bit of a laugh and they said, the funniest thing that made my palm sweat was when you're on the roller skates. I was like, oh, yeah, yeah. And we had a bit of a laugh. And they said, the funniest thing that made my palm sweat was when you're on the roller skates. And I was like, oh, thank you very much. Thanks for letting me know. Me and a lot of pain. Made you feel good. That's good. I'd have to agree with Joe and Snow. It was quite funny. But, yes, I know that you were feeling the pain there. William, thanks very much. We'll catch up with you again and crash dirt a little later on. Do you know what my grandma said about that segment where he was on his roller skates? She said, gosh, he's got lovely calves, hasn't he? Whoa. Go grand. She notices. Yeah. 12 minutes past six. Now the country, of course, moved to Orange overnight with capacity rules being ditched for hospitality, meaning bars and clubs can operate without restrictions. But you still need to wear a mask inside shops. And that's caused backlash from retailers. Joining us now to discuss as Retail-MZ CEO Greg Harford. Greg, good morning. Thanks for joining us. Now, are your members experiencing pushback already on masks? And how is the orange setting going to change that? Absolutely. Masks are a real source of contention because there are lots of customers who don't source of contention because there are lots of customers who don't like them in store. There are lots of customers who are declaring themselves to be self-exempt from the rules that apply. And what we're finding is that there's lots of aggression, there's lots of general nastiness coming from people who don't like wearing masks. And often this is translating into threats or even violence in some cases against retail workers. There are hundreds, if not thousands of incidents every week that are being reported to us about members of the public just losing it a little bit over the fact that they're being asked to wear a mask. Have you spoken with the government about that? Do they know your concerns? Absolutely. We've been talking to the government for months and months now about the issues, particularly the issues around mask exemptions. The government has completely failed to take account of the issue or take any practical steps to deal with it. We see it as not materially different to any of the other various mandatory rules that we've had through COVID. If you have to wear a mask and you have a legitimate reason to be exempt, that's great, but there needs to be a process for managing those exemptions so that actually it is only those people who genuinely have a medical need to not wear a mask that are exempt and that it's not just that you don't like wearing one, that gives you the right to get into store. Of course, if it's for health reasons because it prevents the spread of COVID, that's important, right? What advice have you been given about the spread of COVID through retail environments? Absolutely. I mean, it's important to keep everybody safe. I think all the way through the pandemic, we've been told that retail is a relatively safe environment. Masks are part of the mix to have kept people safe. But there does come a point where the rules just don't make sense. And essentially, the government is now saying that it's okay to go to a crowded pub or a cafe and not wear a mask, but you need to wear a mask while you're going into the shop unless actually you don't really like them and you've declared yourself to be exempt. It just really doesn't make sense. Retail in ZCEO, Greg, Halford. Greg, thanks for joining us this morning. Yeah, that does seem really dumb. If you've got hundreds or thousands, which is what he just said, hundreds or thousands of instances of abuse every week, that's a problem. And as he said, the government's not listening. I just looked, as you were talking, in Sydney, you don't have to wear a mask in retail. Right. You don't have to wear... The only places you wear a mask, public transport, hospital, aged care facility, aircraft. Is there anywhere in the world you have to wear a mask other than public transport? China. Apart from China. But it's kind of us in China. It has been us in China for a long time, isn't it, with a lot of things? The thing is, masks have their place, and they are useful, and they do keep people safe. But when there's a discrepancy and it's really hard to understand the rules, then surely we move into a position where you say, if you feel more comfortable wearing a mask, wear a mask. If you choose not to, don't. Yeah, I'd be keen to hear from what people think of this one. Feedback at amshow.co.com.com.com. Get in touch with us.

It was more aggressive than what many were picking, so let's break it down. Milford Asset Management Investment analyst. Caitlin Parker is with us this morning. Caitlin, good morning. Good morning. So have we seen yet the rates being passed on to our mortgage rates? Yeah, so after the meeting yesterday, we've seen a few the banks pass through the 0.5% increase into their floating rates, and we've actually already seen one bank pass through a significant chunk of that increase into their fixed rates. So going into the meeting, you know, expectations were extremely elevated from the market and wholesale rates were elevated going in. On the back of the meeting, those expectations actually decreased. So from here, what you would expect is that, you know, wholesale rates are coming down. However, into the meeting, they were elevated. So there is a bit of catch-up that banks may look to pass through. There's a lot that goes into, in a lot of factors, that goes into mortgage rates. But, you know, on the flip side, we have also seen an upward movement in term deposit rights, but to a much lesser extent. It's quite a balancing act, isn't it? Because you are trying to control inflation. You're trying to keep prices down. But at the same time, you don't want to take a sledgehammer to the property market. Exactly. And it's an incredibly difficult task. You know, the Arbyn's at, they're facing opposing challenges. On one side where there's lots of indications that the economy is slowing, but if you look at their mandate, which is to achieve maximum sustainable employment and to maintain price stability, you know, you can't argue that they're massively overshooting on both those accounts. So when you're looking at the housing market as well, it was interesting yesterday that the RBNZs, they didn't dwell too much on the downside growth risk to the economy, but they do seem quite happy that house prices are moving towards a more sustainable level. But ultimately, you know, the AirbnbZ, they're not going to want a housing market crash. But the question is, will we see any patience from the AirbnbZ to, you know, in the face of this red-hot inflation down the line? Yeah, exactly. Because, you know, you take with one hand, give with another, don't you? In terms of the interest rate track, and I'm talking more here about mortgage rates, which are, of course, impacted by the OCR, where do you see this peaking? Where is this going? So what actually gave the market a bit of comfort yesterday was that the RBNZ have said that they're comfortable with where they see the OCR peaking where they said back in February which is about that 3.4% over the coming years. So what they did yesterday was they brought the interest rate increases. They brought them earlier. So that's to reduce the risk of them having to bring interest rates even higher in the longer run. So they referred to it as a stitch in time type approach. So that's to reduce the risk of them having to bring interest rates even higher in the longer run. So they referred to it as a stitch in time type approach. So that's key from the meeting yesterday is that that OCR track is unchanged. It's just that the pace is being brought forward. A steeper incline, as it were. Same destination. Caitlin, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Great to see you, as always, Milford Asset Management Investment analyst, Caitlin Parker.

But thank you for your feedback on the idea that maybe we should lessen the isolation time for those who are household contacts of COVID-19. Chop, chop, chop. Yeah. So I say if you've got COVID-19, isolate for seven days. If you're a household contact, just three. But Sarah says I work with under five, so all unvaxed. We've had multiple children and staff returning after the seven- period and then testing positive on day nine or ten so cutting it to three days would be horrible for us the kids aren't showing many symptoms but we'd be exposing multiple at-risk family members but aren't they all vaccinated by now I mean these are the under fives yeah no but the at-risk family members should all be vaccinated right that's the whole point that year we have young people who get it, but they largely don't have symptoms, and then the old people are vaccinated, so we're fine. What is going on? Why is this still a thing? How many people have been with somebody in their house who has had COVID-19 and not caught it at all? Let us know. Feedback at Amshod. My friend just was in that situation. But then she said she's always been a grubby girl getting her hands dirty and getting germs. So she thinks she has immunity. Build up immunity. Yeah, but, yeah, obviously that's... She's just a grubby girl. That's not official advice. No, Claire says I feel better wearing a mask out, when I go out and about. The Prime Minister gave a better reasoning last night for this regarding restaurants and bars versus retail and supermarkets, though she doesn't say what that reason was. I'm assuming because you will eat food in a restaurant and you're very difficult to do that whilst wearing a mask at the same time. Yes, so there is a discrepancy because, yeah, it would be silly if you're on the dance floor and you're taking it on and off. But why is there a discrepancy? You know, we're being told for so long that retail environments are not places where COVID-19 spreads. So just have them masks off and both. And Tracy says 100% masks should be a personal choice. Simply wear one if you want but not enforced. Why wouldn't we do that? At this point, everyone's an adult, unless you're a child, obviously. Why wouldn't you just let people do what they think is safe for them and for their... What people are going to do is start abusing it, I think, and just running, you know, rampant, doing what they want, because they're over it. I think they're over it and I think personal responsibility speaks volumes doesn't it? They'll be running a muck won't they with masks? They'll be wearing their masks in all the wrong places. Look at all to that. That'll protest mask on your chest. It's time now for the news. Atomari at 630 in breaking news, police have arrested this aspect at the centre of the New York subway shooting. At least 20 people were injured. Five critically when a man wearing a gas mask opened fire on a carriage yesterday. In the past half an hour, police have confirmed Frank James has been taken into custody after reportedly being spotted by two officers walking down a Manhattan Street. He's believed to have fired 33 rounds from a semi-automatic handgun, which was later recovered along with a hatchet, fireworks and a container of gasoline. As we start our first day back in the orange traffic light setting, the Green Party says now is not the time to ease the restrictions. They're concerned New Zealand's littlest Kiwis will be most at risk as mask wearing becomes the school's decision. Colita Marama Davidson told AM early, you just have to look overseas to see mask rules being reinstated as case numbers grow. We've seen that not just in the States, actually. It's also in Canada and other parts of the world where they loosened mask restrictions, particularly in schools where all of our young and unvaccinated children are. And so that has seen the rise of another outbreak of COVID cases. And we can actually avoid that. The Greens are also concerned removing restrictions will put Māori and Pacifica disabled people and Fano on the lowest incomes at greater risk. Meanwhile, the government has been slammed for failing to help the retail sector who are suffering abuse for enforcing mask mandates. Retail NZ says there have been hundreds of incidents reported to them about customers abusing retail workers. CEO Greg Hardford told AM there's no logic behind the rules. It's okay to go to a crowded pub or a cafe and not wear a mask, but you need to wear a mask while you're going into the shop unless actually you don't really like them and you've declared yourself to be exempt. It just really doesn't make sense. The mayor of Maripal is calling for urgent aid as the Ukrainian city holds on by a thread. It comes as Russia's defence ministry claims more than a thousand Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered in the port city. The city has spent weeks under intense Russian fire. Mayor Vadim Bochenko says in that time it's become the site of countless war crimes. They collect the bodies. Our intelligence have confirmed today that 13 mobile crematoria have arrived in the city and are being prepared to get rid of evidence of war crimes committed by the Russian Federation within Maripole. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has sparked outrage in the Kremlin, doubling down on claims that Russia is guilty of genocide. 259 people are dead in the wake of extensive flooding and mudslides near Durban in South Africa. Ongoing search and rescue efforts are uncovering the grim aftermath of this week's storm. Officials say some areas saw months' worth of rain in a single day. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the storm as one of the worst in the country's history. In sport, the northern mystics are gearing up for a busier-than-usual business end of the A&Z premiership season. The tournament's been hampered by COVID in recent weeks, causing a scheduling nightmare for teams. Mystics' assistant coach Robin Wright's confident his sights are through the worst of it as he looks ahead to a mammoth fixture pile up. Next couple of weeks for us is a really interesting period of time. We've only got two games in the next three weeks, and then we've got almost half our games in the space of three weeks. So incredible draw, and hopefully, fingers crossed, there's no more schedule changes. The return of Kiwi's captain Dallan Watanil Zelisniak couldn't have come at a better time for the Warriors. The 26-year-old will suit up against the roosters after recovering from a broken thumb quicker than expected. Coach Nathan Brown says Watanee Zelensiak's inclusion in the squad helps add some experience to a young back line. Bringing Dale back in probably good for that. You know, I bloat with, you know, Dale's a lot of experience. He's a New Zealand captain, so it's probably, the timing's probably really good. Sure is that's the very latest from NewsHub. It is 25 to 7. Thanks, Bernardine. Have you noticed recently, and it's only just recently that Joe Biden, every time you see Joe Biden, he's wearing aviator sunglasses, it was just in our bulletin, which you were reading through just then. You would have been reading the script. But yeah, every time we see him now, he's in aviators. Do we have the footage of him in aviators? He kind of looks like Tom Cruise, doesn't he? Yeah, like it's not top gun, you know? What's he has, or has he, see there he is. Oh, look at him. He looks like an FBI agent. Yeah. Well, maybe that's what he's trying to blend in with a security detail. Has he had a browlift or, and here's my theory, is he actually just a body double? Maybe he's just super sunsmart for his eyes. Correct. Really? He's protecting his eyes. I don't know. It's kind of weird. Anyway, that's Joe Biden for you. More interesting to look at than listen to, isn't he? It doesn't make much sense these days. Right, 24 minutes away from 7 o'clock. Anyway, that's Joe Biden for you. More interesting to look at than listen to, isn't he? It doesn't make much sense these days. Right, 24 minutes away from 7 o'clock. We're talking this morning about, what are we talking about this morning? Masks. Chris Hickens. And Chris Hickens. And Chris Hickens yesterday had a bit of a shocker. I actually felt bad for him because at least he was honest. He owned up to it. He said, look, I don't have the footage of Chris Hipkins. He says, I don't have the mask information today. So don't hassle me about it. He said, look, I don't have the, do we have the footage of Chris Hipkins? He says, I don't have the mask information today, so don't hassle me about it. And I thought, well, there's a man who's having a bad day. Yeah, but he owned up to it, as you say. I end up to it. It wasn't, oh, I don't really know, or I don't have that information and trying to cover it. It was just, yeah, I simply don't have it. I can't give it to you right now. Yeah, have a look. We're still encouraging them on flights in public transport. Give me one minute. I've just got masks are still a requirement on public transport, so including flights. You don't have to wear a face mask to the supermarket anymore? No. I do have the updated list now, and I have a picture to my memory of the... Poor old chippy having a shocker of a day at work. And I actually wondered if you were watching that and felt some sympathy for Chris Hitkins. Have you ever had a shocker of a day at work? Have you ever done something at work that was just, you know, really silly that led to you looking like a bit of a tit in the workplace? We'd love your stories this morning on this.

I think it's the coldest start. I've had this year out doing this beautiful mahi, so cold here, but let's check out what the weather's doing around the motu. The weather, bad for hats, great for making power. At Rudion, we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Cyclone Philly has passed by the East Cape and forecasted to move southeast wood away from the North Island. Heavy rain and severe southwest scales for the east coast means weather warnings are in place for the region. Keep an eye out throughout the day for any updates. Now let's head to the weather, the rest of your weather. The Lower South can expect a fine one with a frosty start to the day for some parts of the region. Orte Poti Daner, 19 degrees and Oamaru on 16. To the west coast where it's a fine day with light winds and evening cloud. Peelpeel Tahi Milford Sound 17 degrees in Kawateri, Westport 19. In Canabria, Malbara, it'll be a foggy start for some on an otherwise fine day for the region. Christchurch will Tau Taha'i 16 degrees in Tehwai Harareke Blenham on 18. To the lower north where it's also a fine day with any winds dying out by the evening to Fonganui at Tarah Wellington on 15 degrees and Papa Oia Palmerston North 18. Now to the central plateau where you two are in for a fine day, Fanganui on 18 degrees and Taupor 17. To the east coast where those weather warnings are in place for Gisbon, Wairoa and the Hawks Bay. The rest of the region is in for a fine day. Tahrafiti Gisman on 17 degrees and Rotorua 19. And to the top of our country, Ontario, you two are in for a glamour day with fine weather, Damaki, Macarough, Auckland and Fitianga both on 20 degrees. Hey guys, if you look right through there, the sun's about to rise it's absolutely fine but very cold and brisk. William is it yet cold enough to do that thing where you know you breathe out and it looks like steam is coming out of your mouth is it that cold? Oh it is. It's freezing but that's why I've been trying to dance and keep the morale high in my south time. We thought that might be why you were dancing. Thanks very much, William. That's just a tactic to keep himself warm. Good on you, William. We'll be back with you later on. It's 20 to 7. After the break, we head to the US where a 63-year-old man has been arrested in relation to yesterday's subway shooting in New York.

Be ready for anything this Easter at New World. Where there's always something cooking Welcome back to I am thanks to our partner's course this morning Let's head to the United States now Because there's been a development in the New York subway shooting. So to give us an update on the situation, we're joined by AMUS correspondent Sam Rubin. Sam, what is the latest? The latest is the suspect in the subway shooting is now in police custody. His name is Frank James, arguably the most wanted man in America over the last 24 hours or so. He was apprehended in Manhattan a short while ago, spotted on the street, apparently hiding in plain sight. His picture has been plastered everywhere, as you can appreciate, in New York and elsewhere around the U.S. People called the police. Two police officers arrested him without incident. And as they're learning more about Frank here, they're discovering, you know, and this is the typical behavior, it seems, as so many perpetrators, a variety of online messages, videos, and the like. He essentially didn't say exactly what he was going to do, but he expressed that he was suffering from a variety of mental ailments and things that were upsetting to him. And again, the clues were all there if anyone was looking. Obviously, they weren't. And then, of course, what took place in the subway took place. Awful. I feel very much for the victims of those people that were in that subway attack. Let's go to another story now with Johnny Depp, taking a defamation case against Amber Heard. We're going to hear from a lot of high-profile people in this case. What have we heard so far? What we've heard so far is very interesting. Some have described this as a scorpion death dance that basically the two just continue to muddy one another up, and that definitely impacts not only about how fans feel about them, but how Hollywood feels about them. Johnny Depp has not been hired for a major role, frankly, in years. Amber Hurd says all of this has diminished her capabilities of an earning as an actress as well. She is suing him for $100 million, 50 million, and he's suing her for $100 million. It's a lot of money on the line here. And today was very unusual. An old childhood friend of Johnny Depp's went to the stand. As an adult, Johnny hired him as an artist to make paintings that Johnny Depp would later help him sell. He lived in the same luxury complex in downtown Los Angeles, literally next door to Johnny and Amber in a apartment that Johnny put him up in. And he was essentially asked to describe what he witnessed. And this was a very meandering way to lead to. Has Johnny referred to Amber in texts using a variety of very harsh vulgarities? The texts were there. They were read aloud in the courtroom. And so basically the jury of seven, including an additional four alternates, are hearing a variety of nasty phrases that Johnny Depp used to describe Amber Heard, sort of setting the stage, I think, for what they've already proved in England that he physically abused Amber Hurd. That's her claim. Johnny Depp is suing, saying when she wrote an editorial saying that he effectively was an abuser, even though he was not named in the piece that Amber Hurd wrote, that that damages his reputation, and it's not true. Johnny Seid is saying that Amber's entire thing is a big lie. Amber says it's completely true, and she'll prove it. In this case, she'll prove it again. Yeah, I mean, the only thing that we can conclude safely is that it was quite a bizarre and messy relationship, wasn't it? I am U.S. correspondent, Sam, thanks very much for being with us. Yeah, it certainly sounds that way, doesn't it? Goodness me. 12 minutes away from 7 o'clock. Now, we're talking this morning about bad days at the office. Chris Hickens had a bit of a shocker yesterday when he was trying to remember things about the masks and forgot and blah, blah, blah. But we've all had them. And many of you have been writing in this morning with your stories of things that have gone. Your worst day at the office, things you're stuffed up and that kind of stuff. Mind blanks. Have you had one? Well, I can recall a time when I was working in a bakery and I'm not very good with food or cooking and they asked me once to cook a big slab of corned beef and so I put it in the pot and I just put a little bit of water at the bottom. So of course it cooked the bottom and the whole top was raw and they came in like, what are you doing? I was like, oh yeah, I just didn't even think that you'd have to cook the whole lot at once. Whoopsie. Bernie, what about you? Corned beef off the menu that day. Oh, it's too many, too many to list. I remember as a young reporter and this, I'll rookie mistake, Arkansas. You know how you spell Arkansas? It's spelled Arkansas. So when you read Arkansas, so I'm reading Arkansas as a young junior and the director was screaming in my ear that it was wrong, but she was screaming so loudly. I couldn't make out what she was saying. So it was Arkansas for an entire bulletin. Ever make that mistake again? That kind of reminds me the very first time I did what was called a voicer in radio and you had to like, you had 30 seconds and you had to say the story. It was about headphones or iPhones or something. Anyway, at the end of this 30 seconds, you meant to say where you work and your name. Very simple. And it was my first one and I was so nervous. And I said, from the Radio Live News Centre I'm Brian Ridge instead of Brian Bridge which is obviously my name and so for three months they called me Brian Nice work maz Anyway email us this morning Feedback at a mshow.co.n.

Cyclone fairly swept down the East Coast over the last couple of days. And the Gisbon Mayor, Reheat Stoltz, joins me now for the very latest. Rehe, good morning and welcome to the program. How was last night for your region? Rain was still pouting down until around midnight, and I can tell you, we woke up this morning to a calm morning. So we are hopeful today that we can carry on, continue the work to connect our community again. Have you had a chance yet to assess any of whether there is flooding, surface flooding in the areas or road closures? So we had severe surface flooding yesterday. Waka-Kutahi last night made the call to close State Highway 35 north of Gisbon because there were just too many trees down. After the rain, the winds came and there were so many trees down. Homes were without electricity. So they were on the network this morning at 6 o'clock starting to clear that so that we can open State Highway 35 again. And then I also know that the State Highway to Wairua was closed as well. So the Waka Kota'i teams are on the network with our local contractors to open that up so that we can travel for Easter. Have you got an idea yet? You mentioned Easter and I know there'll be lots of people watching and waiting for a time. Do you know what time roughly they might open? No. So we are asking people to check the Waka Kotao-N-ZTA website as they might open? No. So we are asking people to check the Waka-Kortai NZTA website as they progressively open. They will update that on the map. It's really easy to follow, so they will be updating us as they go. And what about power? There were outages yesterday and last night. Has all power been restored or still work being done? Still work being done. So many trees down, so many power lines damaged. So I know like last night there was still quite a few homes disconnected and Eastland Network are working around the clock to make sure they bring those back onto the network as quickly as possible this morning. No need for evacuations. I know a lot of the most at-risk homes were already red-sticked as it were, three weeks ago. So does that mean that, you know, there was no need for that type of, types of evacuations? Yesterday late afternoon, it was touch and go. There was, close to the Hakawe River. We were alerting people that they might have to evacuate. But in the end, the river levels came down as we predicted. So no mass evacuations like we had three weeks ago. All right, Rahit. Well, stay warm and dry. Thanks so much for joining us this morning, as always. Hopefully those roads can be opened in time for people to travel for the Easter weekend. It's three away from seven. Now that's the Gisbon Mayor, Rehit Stoltz. I've had lots of feedback coming in on mind blanks at work or little mistakes, perhaps. You've just had a bad day at work. And this is on the back of Chris Hickens yesterday, not really being able to answer questions about where masks can and can't be worn. And he said, look, I'm just having it my blank. I need to get the information. Paul says, hey, let's look at the bright side of Hickens Blunder. For the first time, and I don't know how long a Labor Minister told the truth when he said he didn't have the information in front of him. Perhaps the PM could take note. Another pool has had a shocker at work where he was working for a chain store selling home appliances, and they needed some brochures on whiteware products. So he filled in an order form. A couple of weeks later, a distress call came from the storming, saying the biggest truck and trailer had arrived full of whiteware with the order ID Paul. So basically instead of ordering 200 brochures for the whiteware, he'd ordered 200 of the whiteware products. Oh my gosh. Oops. That is a muck-up of great proportions, isn't it? This is on the other end of the scale. But when I was at high school, I worked at Cobb & Co. Remember Cobb & Co? Oh, I love. Traffic like drinks? Yes. And the pink panther. And the ribs? Remember the ribs? You probably don't remember the ribs. You guys wouldn't have been eating ribs. The cobets. I remember the cobets. I went there with a friend of mine and he hates this story. But he was carrying the ribs to, because there's a hot plate. So it's actually very delicate. And he was carrying the ribs to the customer who'd ordered them and got halfway and dropped the ribs on the ground. And promptly picked them up off the carpet. And you know Cobb & Coe carpet you don't really want to be spending too much time feet is sticking to it pick the ribs up off the carpet put them back on the plate and carried on to the table all the while the owner of the restaurant was watching him so he got fine that's not a mind blank that's just wrong tell us your mind blanks. Feedback at a.m.show.com.n. Make us all feel better. This is AM. It's 7 o'clock. No-my, Heidi, Mai. It's Thursday the 14th of April. You're with AM. And it's wonderful to have your company. The long weekend is nearly upon us. But coming up on the show today, masks on or masks off. Nobody can keep track of the rules anymore, not even the COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins. He joins us in 10 minutes time. To fix or not to fix. To mask or not to mask? To fix or not to fix? And for how long it's the question we're all worrying about in the wake of the latest OCR hike? Your mortgage, we've got an advisor in 20 minutes. Support for the Prime Minister among small businesses has dropped 15 points in a new survey while National's numbers have soared. We'll discuss this with a political panel of David Parker and Nicola Willis after 7.30. Plus, we're giving away $5,000 this morning to one champion of touch rugby. Who's the lucky winner today? Find out later in the show right now. Here's your news. Atomaria, it's 7 o'clock. The retail sector is desperate for mask mandates to be removed, saying the government's reasoning for keeping them in stores makes no sense. Eager punters lined the streets outside popular student club bar 101 last night, ahead of dance floors reopening when the country moved to the orange traffic line setting at midnight. Under the change, limits on indoor gatherings have been dropped, along with the need to remain seated and distanced. Retail NZ CEO Greg Harford told AM the rules are unfair and retail staff will cop the abuse. We've been talking to the government for months and months now about the issues, particularly the issues around mask exemptions. The government has completely failed to take account of the issue or take any practical steps to deal with it. But the Greens say now is not the time for restrictions to be eased in any environment. They are particularly concerned about our littlest Kiwis as mask wearing becomes voluntary in schools. Co-leadam-Davidson told AM early, you just have to look overseas to see mask rules being reinstated as case numbers grow. We've seen that not just in the States, actually. It's also in Canada and other parts of the world where they loosened mask restrictions, particularly in schools where all of our young and unvaccinated children are. And so that has seen the rise of another outbreak of COVID cases. And we can actually avoid that. New York police say they're confident they've caught the 62-year-old man behind yesterday's subway shooting. At least 20 people were injured, five critically, when a man wearing a gas mask opened fire on a carriage yesterday. Police have this morning confirmed Frank James has been taken into custody after reportedly being spotted by two officers walking down a Manhattan Street. New York Police Commissioner Kashan Sewell says it's the conclusion to a citywide manhunt. We used every resource at our disposal to gather and process significant evidence that directly links Mr James to the shooting. We were able to shrink his world quickly. There was nowhere left for him to run. He's believed to have fired 33 rounds from a semi-automatic handgun, which was later recovered along with a hatchet, fireworks and a container of gasoline. Joe Biden has doubled down on claims that Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. The comments have been faced with fierce criticism from the Kremlin. A spokesperson appeared on Russian radio calling the comments distorted and unacceptable. But the U.S. President has escalated his rhetoric in return. Literally is a horrible thing that the Russians have done in Ukraine. We're going to only learn more and more of devastation. And we'll let the lawyers decide internationally of whether or not it qualifies. But it sure seems that way to me. Meanwhile, Mario Pol's mayor is warning that Ukraine's troops are barely hanging on. It comes as the Kremlin claims more than a thousand Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered to Russia in the Port City. Back here, Gisbon and Wairo district residents have avoided more evacuations as they wake up to clear skies this morning. Several homes spend the night without par, while many remain cut off by damaged roads. Clearly that is not Wider. A flood warning is in place for the Hikawa River with the two districts remaining under a red weather warning although I do know it was pretty wet at the soccer. Gisbon Mayor Rehatsch-Scholtz told AM Waka Kotahir trying their best to open roads as quickly as possible. I played a lot of games back to back. It wasn't a complete performance but I think it was a good enough performance to get the job done and get the three points, and I think the boys will be pretty excited to fly back on Friday. All right, let me tell you about those pictures. The Wellington Phoenix, they've strung together back-to-back wins. This is sports news in the A-League, edging bottom of the table, Perth, Glory 1-0. Mexican midfielder Gail Sanderval broke the deadlock for the Phoenix early in the second half as they held on for their fourth clean sheet of the season. Wasn't their best performance, but as you've heard, Ufuk Talley is pleased to have picked up on an important three points before heading home. And they'll play their first game in 300 days on home soil coming up soon. So good news for the Phoenix. Crusaders coach Scott Robertson admits there's an extra edge to his clash this week's against the Blues in Christchurch. The Auckland side are in fine form and believe they're in the best shape to try and win their first game in the Garden City since 2004. Robertson's wary of their rivals off the back of some brutal games. Probably a little bit more on it than normal. But, you know, the last three years, intensity and the spike, the running loads, the contacts, we're just keeping in more and more and more. Finally, at seven, it's one small step for man, one giant leap, four cababs. A Turkish restaurant owner has sent one of his spicy cabbs into space to commemorate the 601st anniversary of the first human spaceflight. After flying for three hours at an altitude of 40 kilometres, the kebab-laden balloon burst and fell into the sea off the coast of Turkey's Huttai province. The kebab was found 121 kilometres from the launch site, largely intact. Perhaps a little soggy, but largely intact. That's the very latest news hub, six past seven. Imagine if you were snorkeling at the time. Bam, right in the eye. Taken out by a low-flying kebab. What a way to go? The kebab got me. You would have thought that you'd probably gone already if you're seeing a kebab coming at you, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? Be like, I've really lost it. We have had a lot of feedback from you in terms of mask use. And the discrepancies between being able to wear them on the nightclub and in supermarket. Glenn says, I'm going to patch a stranger in the supermarket today with my mask on. Wish me luck. You don't. No, maybe don't. Something about that image is disgusting, isn't it? It is disturbing. But Christine says masks in retail sounds sensible to me, the most vulnerable, including the elderly are in the community, supermarkets, shops, etc. And not on the dance floor. So where does this end? Because I heard somebody on the news last night talking about the flu. Is this just normal now? We're going to be wearing masks every winter. Have the goalposts shifted now? We're all going to be in masks and we're all going to be in masks and we're all going to be, you know, or is this a COVID thing? I just don't know about where we're going with all this, really. Got COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hickens on the show very soon. But first we're going to head to William, who is in the Garden City this morning. What a beautiful city it is. Morena, yes, Mel, in the Garden City this morning. Very cold and foggy, as you can see. Check out the back. Foggy start in Ototahi Christchurch. We're at the south side of Hagley Park this morning. Foggy here, but let's check out the weather at your place. The weather. Bad for Hats. Great for making power. At Rudion we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Cyclone Philly has passed by the East Cape and forecasted to move south eastward away from the North Island. Heavy rain and severe southwest gales for the east coast means weather warnings are in pace for the region. Keep an eye out throughout the day for any updates. Now to the rest of your weather, the lower south can expect a fine one with a frosty star to the day for some parts of the region. Ote-Poti-Denera, 19 degrees and Oamaru on 16. To the west coast where it's a fine day with light winds and evening cloud. Peopo-peel Tahi Milford Sound, 17 degrees and Kawateri Westport, 19. In Canterbury and Malbara, it'll be a foggy start for some on an otherwise fine day for the region. Christchurch will totahi 16 degrees and Te' Waai Harakeke, Blenham on 18. To the lower north where it is also a fine day with any wind's dying out by the evening, to Fanganui at Tarah, Wellington on 15 and Papua-A-Palmerston North 18. Now to the central plateau where you two are in for fine weather, Fanganui on 18 degrees and Taupor 17. To the east coast where those weather warnings are in place for Gisbon, Waira and the Hawks Bay, the rest of the region is in for a fine day. Tairafiti Gisbon on 17 degrees at Rotorua 19. And to the top of our country, you two are in for a glamorous day with fine weather, Tamiki Makoto, Auckland and Fitianga both on 20 degrees. And if you make your way over here, you'll see the haggly over right there when a lot of the cricket goes on, waiting. No run. I imagine you've spent a few summers there, summer afternoons there, William. Yeah, definitely, Mel. I don't mind, you know, rolling the arm over. Favorite player, Chris Pringle. Oh, all right, there, Mel. I don't mind rolling the arm over. Favorite player, Chris Pringle. Ah, all right, there you go. William in Christchurch this morning, thanks very much. We'll catch up with you a little later for the reason you were there, a very special reason. It's nine minutes past seven. Now, we are officially in the orange traffic light setting. Patching on the dance floor will no longer require mask use, but you'll still need to keep your mouth covered in the supermarket. So if that's confusing, you can understand why COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, had trouble recalling the rules yesterday. He joins me now. Minister, I think a few people, quite a lot of people will actually feel for you yesterday. Just a bit of a mind-blank, perhaps not the best day on the job. No, look, I made a mistake in reading out my introductory notes where I skipped over a bit that was actually quite important, and then I got a little bit of flustered as a result of that and made it worse before making it better. So, look, it was a bad day. I'll own that. I made a mistake. Unfortunately, in this job, when you make a mistake, and all of the nation's media have their cameras pointed at you, it's a bad day. I'll own that. I made a mistake. Unfortunately, in this job, when you make a mistake and all of the nation's media have their cameras pointed at you, it's a difficult thing to back away from. I feel for you. We have all been there. And a lot of people are writing in and saying, they're appreciative that you acknowledged, that you just didn't have that information. People said it's nice to hear the honesty. You're just admitting it, acknowledging it. It's nice, refreshing. Good on you. Look, in reality, everybody makes mistakes. Not everybody makes mistakes with a whole lot of cameras in front of them. But I do believe that when you do stuff that make up, the best thing that you can do is own that and just say, look, I've made a mistake here, I'll wear that and hopefully people will move on from it. Absolutely. I do want to ask you, look, I've made a mistake here, I'll wear that and hopefully people will move on from it. Absolutely. I do want to ask you, though, are you more likely to catch COVID in a supermarket or in a nightclub? Look, there's a rationale for the distinction here. And again, one of the mistakes I made there yesterday was repeating the line of questioning in my answer to the question. So you can blame Jenna Lynch for the passing on the dance floor line in the press conference yesterday. But the issue here is people have to go to the supermarket. And so you're going to have people who are elderly, who are immunocompromised, they've still got to go to the supermarket alongside everybody else. The decision to go to a nightclub, that's a choice that people make. They can make a choice not to go to a nightclub, that's a choice that people make. They can make a choice not to go to a nightclub. And it is also practically very difficult to wear a mask when you're in a nightclub. Let's be realistic about that. Often people walking around with a drink. They might be eating sometimes. And yes, doing some other things which are very difficult to do when you have a mask on. So there's a practical reality there too. Yeah, and I think few people would dispute that it would be silly to have to keep have a mask on. So, you know, there's a practical reality there too. Yeah, and I think few people would dispute that it would be silly to have to keep taking your mask on and off if you're in a place where you're drinking. But for bar and hospitality owners, what they will be concerned about today is the fact that in November last year, Dr Caroline McElnay said places like supermarkets and drive-thrus were no longer being reported as places of interest because the public health risk was very low. So if the public health risk was very low in supermarkets then, and they're still having to wear masks, why couldn't bars and nightclubs have been opened a lot earlier? Look, the reality is things change and we have to acknowledge that in an environment where probably over a million New Zealanders and potentially up to two million New Zealanders have had COVID-19 in the last few months. We're in quite a different environment to the one that we were in last year. In terms of supermarkets, one of the reasons that they're no longer as risky in an environment as they were previously is people are wearing masks in a supermarket and that massively decreases the risk in a place like a supermarket where they tend to have very high ceilings, very good airflow through them, and people are wearing masks. On the other hand, a bar or a nightclub, there is an increased degree of risk. But those are choices that people make. And ultimately, they'll make informed decisions. We can give them the information we can, and they'll make their own decisions about whether or not they want to hit the clubs. So you can go to a bar now and buy a drink without wearing a mask. Can you serve somebody a drink without wearing a mask? No, we are still asking bar and hospitality staff to wear masks, and we don't want them to ultimately be super spreaders so we don't want them taking COVID-19 from one table to the next to the next. And we also want to keep them safe as well. There are a number of sectors where you will still have to wear masks, you know, public transport, flights, indoor retail. But what about those sectors outside of that? Can employers now mandate masks? Can employers make people wear masks in their jobs now? Look at ultimately it's going to depend on the context of what those people are doing and where they are doing it. And, you know, ultimately, you know, employers have always been able to set their own rules across a wide range of things. And if they choose to have a mask requirement in place, then ultimately they have those, particularly when you're talking about private premises, if you're talking about rules to be in a private premise, well, those are your decisions to make. Is this going to be like the vaccination mandates where employers are now going to have to take that legal risk about whether they introduce that or continue it themselves? No, it is a different threshold when you're talking about a mask versus a vaccination. A vaccination is a greater infringement on somebody's rights requiring them to have a vaccination. A mask not so much. So if you think about it, a mask is not that much different to a uniform. You know, some employers require people to wear a uniform and they can do that consistently. It's not a great infringement on somebody's human rights to require someone to wear a uniform to do a certain type of job. And masks, I think, would be more in that category than in the vaccination category. At what point will the government do you think say, right, we're now going to leave it up to people's personal responsibility to stay home when they feel sick as opposed to government-imposed rules on people when they can and can't leave the house? Well, we're certainly not at that point at the moment. We still have a lot of COVID-19 circulating in the community. And our goal, of course, is to still reduce the number of people who get COVID-19, reduce the number of people who end up in hospital from COVID-19. So we ultimately, you know, that guidance is still in place, that seven-day isolation requirement is still in place. And it will be there for as long as it needs to be in order to keep the trend pointing in a downward direction. You know, that's good news for New Zealand, ultimately, that the trend is continuing to go down. What about for household contacts, though? I mean, in the UK household contacts there there is no requirement for them to isolate at all. For people with COVID they have self-isolation for five days. When are those settings going to be reviewed here? Not immediately, but it is one of the things that we keep under constant review. So we're not making changes there at the moment but I wouldn't rule out there being changes there in the future. Is the flu, the onset of the flu, this season, having any influence on those rules? One of the things we have to keep in mind is that we could see the double whammy overwinter of a flu season peak and potentially another COVID-19 peak. And if those two things go hand in hand, there may need to be at some level of response to that because the potential for a lot of people to get quite sick quite quickly absolutely exists. And other countries have experienced that and they've had to in some cases have other restrictions put back in place for a period of time to deal with that kind of winter peak. So, you know, we'll be monitoring that closely. If we see COVID-19 reduced to the extent that flu is actually overtakes it in terms of case numbers, will we still have these kinds of measures or are these measures only being used in response to COVID-19? Look, they are ultimately COVID-19 protection measures rather than every other infectious disease or infectious condition that might be out there. But I think we do have to be aware that an increase in COVID cases over winter combined with the fact that we haven't had the same degree of winter flu peak over the last few years because of the border restrictions and the health measures that we've had in place. That could put both the hospital system but actually also just generally the economy under quite a lot of pressure because quite a lot of people could end up being at home recovering from illness over winter. Hey Minister, it's Ryan here. Just really quickly, you know the COVID deaths that we talk about on the TV at 6 o'clock news, 4 or 500 people have died with COVID, how many are we certain have died of COVID? The majority of those COVID-19 played a factor in their, you know, played a role in their passing. It's a very difficult area to do. We follow the international norm. So the international norm is to report people who have died within a period of time after they have contracted COVID-19 regardless of... Those people could have died. It could have been doing car crash, cancer, all sorts of things, right? And that is absolutely the case in all of the international statistics around this. So one of the things that we look at is what our regular mortality rate is and what are we seeing over and above that? Because a number of people will die every year because that is the human life cycle, it's the reality of life. We all go at some point. And so what we look at is, you know, on a yearly basis, are we trending above that? Are we seeing an excess number of deaths relative to what we would expect in a typical year? At the moment, clearly we are. How many more, Jim? That is evidence that... Can you tell us how many more? Look, I didn't memorize the graph, but it is trending above where we would normally expect to be at this time in a typical annual cycle. COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hapkins.

The Reserve Bank has raised the official cash rate by 0.5%, a move which generally sees banks follow suit with a hike in their own mortgage interest rates. So, if you're thinking about borrowing, what should you be considering right now to discuss? I'm joined by mortgage broker Jamie Sandus. And Jamie, good morning. Morning, how are you? Good, thank you. It's been a long time since we've been in a rate climb, isn't it? What do people generally do, do they start to think about longer term or do they take the short term options? Yeah, it's been the first time probably a lot of people have even been in a rising rate environment. So it's probably about six or so years since if you bought a house in that time that you've never had to face into this. So that's a good conversation that we've been having recently because a lot of people have been really used to just kind of fixing for the best rate, which, and that's typically been over the shorter term. The one thing now is that the best rate might not be the best thing for you. So more so than ever, it's probably best to have a conversation with an advisor who actually goes and looks at it's not just about which rate to choose, but also your circumstances, your goals, what you've got coming up in the future as well. Yeah, because you've got to start, and I know you can't give any specific advice to us about our own situations, but you do have to start thinking about how much can I afford to tack on every week to my mortgage payments right now. Yeah, you really do because I was looking at a case yesterday for a client, and they've got a home line, it's about $548,000. And they're coming off the rate of like 2.29%, going up to what's now, 5.25%, and that's going to be an extra 940 per month for the outgings for them. So 11,000 a year, which is going to play a huge factor. And there's a lot of other costs that people are having to tackle right now as well. So yeah. Yeah, I think a lot of people need to sit down and actually do some budgeting. One thing that we see a lot is that people don't really understand what they've got going out of their bank account on a monthly basis. You know, how much are you spending on groceries, how much he's spending at the pub on a Friday, and just starting to try and factor that in a bit more with this extra lump that you're going to have. If you're trying to get a mortgage, you know, you're going through a mortgage broker to get one, traditionally we hear the banks test at about six or seven percent interest rate to see whether you can still repay at that rate. As the interest rates increase, do they increase also the rate they test at? The testing rates will increase over time. There's sometimes a bit of a catch-up with that. But I think that's really important to note that, you know, over the last couple of years when the rates have been so low, the banks have been testing a lot higher, so they're comfortable that one, if the rates did increase, that you're comfortable with the repayments, and two, you've still got enough to cover your monthly living expenses as well. The triple-CF law, or what I termed, the Uber Eats law, where they trawl through your bank statements to find examples of extravagant spending. Is that still hurting people? Because the government did say they were going to try and fix it. Yeah, I mean, it's still there for the moment. There has been a draft come out of changes. And it is something that we face on a daily basis when we're looking at people's living expenses. I mean, everyone doesn't kind of live to get a mortgage in three months' time. And the last few months have been really difficult because it's been Christmas and holidays. True. So it's been a bit more challenging for some trying to. It's not something you can kind of undo. No. So the banks are looking, well, look, you spend all that money on Christmas presents. Is that a regular thing? Yeah, well, I mean, you know, Christmas, I guess, is a regular thing. Well, it's that every year, though, isn't it? Yeah, so it's a bit. Holidays and, yeah, it probably looks a little extravagant than it otherwise would. We're going to leave it there, but I guess the summary is think about more about the long term, if you can afford to, and obviously an eye to your weekly budget too.

Support for the PM has dropped 15 points among small businesses in a new survey, so we're going to chat with our political panel about that at 740. And sex education in schools is getting an update. We're discussing this just after 8. It is now time for the news. Morning, good morning, 732. In breaking news, a person has barricaded themselves inside a property in West Auckland this morning. Nats Levy is in our Auckland newsroom with the details. Nats, what do you know so far? Yes, at around 6 a.m this morning, police were executing a search warrant at a Henderson Valley Road in West Auckland. The person inside the property barricaded themselves in the property and started issuing threats to the police. Police have called in an extra presence and cordoned off the area Henderson Valley Road and Great North Road as a safety measure and to try and de-escalate the situation. All right and I know you'll keep us up to date with any developments. Nats leaving our Auckland Newsroom, thank you. Gisbon and Wairo district residents have avoided more evacuations as they wake up to clear skies this morning. Several homes spent the night without par while many remain cut off by damaged roads. A flood warning is in place for the Hikawa River with the two districts remaining under a red weather warning. Gisbon Mayor Rahat Stoltz told AM Waka Kotahi are trying their best to open roads as quickly as possible. So we are asking people to check the Waka Kota'i are trying their best to open roads as quickly as possible. So we are asking people to check the Waka Kota'i NZTA website as they progressively open. They will update that on their map. It's really easy to follow, so they will be updating us as they go. Keep an eye out for maskless moonwalking this Easter weekend as nightclubs burst open. A switch to the orange traffic light setting means indoor gathering limits are gone and masks won't be required in some places. But COVID-19 response minister Chris Hipkins is defending the decision to keep them mandatory on the weekly shop. People have to go to the supermarket. And so you're going to have people who are elderly, who are immunocompromised, they've still got to go to the supermarket alongside everybody else. The decision to go to a nightclub, that's a choice that people make. There's confusion about the decision with retail New Zealand saying the new mask rules make no sense. The United Nations claims Russia's invasion of Ukraine is having a global ripple effect that it will be felt for generations to come. It's warning of supply shortages and one of history's most severe refugee situations has sent the market into a spiral. Its latest figure show that one in five developing countries won't see their GDP return to 2019 levels even by the end of next year. Secretary General Antonio Gutier says the war in Europe has only accelerated the issue. We are now facing a perfect storm that threatens to devastate the economies of many developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and the lack of access to adequate resources to finance the recovery in the context of persistent and growing inequalities. Meanwhile, the United States says Russian troops are still moving into Ukraine's eastern territory, raising fears a large-scale assault could be imminent. 259 people are dead following extensive flooding in mudslides near Durban and South Africa. Search and rescue efforts are uncovering the grim aftermath of this week's storm. Officials say some areas saw months' worth of rain in a single day. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the storm as one of the worst in the country's history. In sport, the A&ZNEPL premiership is ready to rumble, with full crowds finally allowed back into games under the Orange Light settings. The season's been heavily disrupted by COVID with a host of games postponed. As a result, the Northern Mystics haven't played in almost two weeks, while the stars have only played two of their six matches. But Mystics' assistant coach, Robin Wright's, relieved they'll finally be able to play at packed stadiums again. They're over the moon that we actually get rural crowds back and it's just fantastic for netball. The whole country's been starved of live netball so it's fantastic for every team. The Wellington Phoenix have consolidated themselves inside the A-League's top six with a 1-0 win over bottom of the table, Perth Glory. A rain-soaked pitch made it difficult for both sides, but Mexican star Gail Sanderville stepped up for the Phoenix, breaking the deadlock with his fifth goal of the season. The victory moves Wellington up to fifth on the ladder. It will return to New Zealand tomorrow as they look to play their first match on home soil in more than 300 days. That's the very latest from News Hub. It is 24 to 8. Thanks very much, Bernardine. I was reading through this Treasury report, which in terms of well-being... This sounds interesting. It's a little light bedtime reading, isn't it? As you do, you know, just a little bit of light reading. But no, it was actually quite interesting because it was saying who is better off in terms of age in New Zealand. And it was saying that elderly people, their well-being, is better at that age. But it made me think, well, which decade of your life is the best? 20s? Definitely. I mean, I haven't had as many decades as others around. But I would say my 20s because you've got no, well, very little responsibility. You've got enough income to, you know, go to the pub on a Friday night, have a good time. You're not anchored down to anything. You've got no mortgage. You've generally got no kids in modern days anyway. You can travel wherever you're like. It's freedom, isn't it, in your 20s? So are you talking financially or just... Anything, overall. And it doesn't have to be a decade that you've already lived. Ben, what would you... Genuinely, I believe every decade brings something amazing. As you say, 20s is great. 30s can bring you the kids and maybe the first home. Everything is a little milestone each decade. I can't single out one because they're all so cool. Do you think they get better? You know how people say life? Yeah, I do. Well, you're adding to the fabric of your story, your narrative. You're adding to it. And you look back and you think, 20s is great, but my God, I did some dumb stuff. You know, and you look back and you learn, and that's what makes life, you know, exciting and different. What about you? I'm looking forward to my 50s. I think 20s was great, but my God, I did some dumb stuff. You know, and you look back and you learn, and that's what makes life, you know, exciting and different. What about you? I'm looking forward to my 50s. I think, you know, my son will be a bit more grown up. You're kind of more financially secure. You're not quite retirement age, so you're probably at your peak seniority in terms of your career. Yeah, but it comes with a warning though. The body starts to pack up and honestly you're like a human glow stick when you get out of bed in the morning. You crack and you crack and you're so, you know, enjoy that your youth with your body when you've got it. Yeah, true. I guess the other thing is you don't want to get the older you get, I do worry that the older you get you start worrying about dying. Do you know what I mean? No, you can't worry about dying. The only worry is not living. True, true. William, what's your favourite decade? What decade do you think is the best of your life? More than Mel and guys back there, yes. I'd say probably from zero to ten years old because, you know, I was financially free, going on holidays all the time, always around Fano. So I think zero to 10 was amazing. But the current 30s I'm enjoying. I'm in the soft 30s, so I'm enjoying the soft 30s so far. Plus, you could eat, before you turned 10, you could eat whatever lollies you want, whatever junk you want, and nothing happens to your body, William. Yeah, absolutely. And now you have a thick shake to your body, William. Yeah, absolutely. And now you have a thick shake and you're jiggling from the back for weeks. So on that note, guys, we're going to head to the weather around the motu. The weather, bad for hats. Great for making power. At Rudion, we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Cycline Philly has passed by the East Cape and forecasted to move southeastward away from the North Island. Heavy rain and severe southwest scales for the east coast means weather warnings are in place for the region. Keep an eye out throughout the day for any updates. Now to the rest of your weather. The lower south can expect a fine one with a frosty start to the day for some parts of the region. Ote Poti Denean, 19 degrees and Oamaru, 16. To the west coast where it's a fine day with light winds and evening cloud. Peelpeo Tahi Milford Sound, 17 degrees, and Kawateri, Westport, 19. In Canterbury and Moulbara, it will be a foggy start for some on an otherwise fine day for the region. Christchurchal, Tautahi, 16 degrees, and Teweigh-Harakekeke. Blenheim on 18. To the lower north where it's also a fine day with any winds die now by the evening, Tefanganuiya-Tara-Walington on 15 degrees and Papa-hoia, Palmerston North, 18. To the central plateau where you two are in for a fine for fine weather Fanganui on 18 degrees and Taupo 17 To the east coast where those weather warnings are in place for Gisbon, Wairoa and Hawks Bay The rest of the region is in for a fine day though Ta'ra Fiti Gisbon on 17 degrees and Rotorua 19 And to the top of our country Aaltearoa you two are in for a glamorous day with fine weather, Tamaki, Macaura, Auckland and Fitianga, 20 degrees. All right, we're here down in Autotahe for a special reason. We're in the beautiful botanical gardens but we're celebrating another Bunnings' home ground hero and we're here with one of a lady who's nominated our home ground hero, Nikki Swast, Nikki, thank you. Mornina, good to see you. Why have you nominated Naser for this home ground hero, Bunnings's ring ground hero? Oh, he's just such a pillar of our touch community, but not only our touch community, like he's just an all-round amazing man. He's got so much mana. And he's so deserving. Like he gives so much of himself, his time, his own resource to benefit others. So to have the opportunity to be able to celebrate him and give him something in return is just amazing. I'm so excited. And, yeah, and Kayawa. He's created that touch theme. Oh, a club. And, yeah, and Kayawa. Yes. He's created that touch team. Oh, a club. Yes, a club, yes. So both touch and netball with Kaua. And in the first year, like unheard of 25 touch teams, 13 rangatahi teams. Yeah, and the Premier Men's, like, won the tournament out there in Belfast. But, you, but I know he's a stalwart of the touch community, not just locally but nationally as well. Why do you think he's going to spend that $5,000 prize on? It's a lot of money. I think that he will, knowing him, he's going to put it all back into the game. I know he's talked about getting like boots for the kids. I mean, the age range of our kids playing is like from 4 to 16. So yeah, he'll be giving it back to his club. Oh, I can't wait. I just can't wait to celebrate this. Okay. Naza, I know Nazar as well. I know him very well. So the Bunnings home ground hero, we're going to be celebrating him very soon, 30 minutes' time, so stay with us. He's obviously not aware. He's being instructed, taken away, so he's not watching this. So he doesn't know yet that he is about to win $5,000 thanks to Bunnings. So we will come back to William and give that money away very soon. It's 17 minutes away from 8 o'clock.

Okay, my Arnold, welcome back. Thanks to joining us on AM today. You're listening to, well, you should be listening to Think by Aretha Franklin, who was a headliner on the very first VH1 Diva's special debut in 1998 as part of a benefit concert. But you're currently listening to Beyonce. This, the banger she used to announce her pregnancy at the Music Awards a couple of years back. Let's take a look at other events from the 14th of April with this day in history. On this day in 2018, the Black Sticks women won Commonwealth gold. Up until them, the team had not won a major tournament. In 1998, the very first VH1 Diva's special debuted as a benefit concert for VH1's Save the Music Foundation. Headliners included Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Legends. And Beyonce was the first black woman to headline the Coachella Music Festival in 2018. And finally, the unemployed, rioted Auckland's Queen Street, armed with fence palings and stones taken from a mini-golf course in Civic Square in 1932. Oh, that was the day in history for the 14th of April. All right, seeing as tomorrow's a public holiday, we wouldn't want to miss our weekly political panels. So joining me now from Parliament is National Party leader Nicola Willis, a deputy leader I should say, and Labor MP David Parker. Good morning. Good morning. Happy Easter. Happy Easter. You guys look suitably awkward standing there. Yeah, staring down the barrel's always a bit unnatural. It's nice to be here with David, Ryan. That's nice to have you both here. I want to talk about the NYUB poll just to kick us off. This is the Business Monitor Survey. So it's like the pulse of small business in New Zealand. David, Jacinda Adirn, 40% support from small business in September last year. That's dropped to 25 now. Meanwhile, Christopher Larkson at 42%. Why do you think small to medium enterprises are losing faith in the government? Well, look, I think small to medium enterprises, like all of us, have had it pretty tough under COVID. Some of the government's supports for people in the workplace have been unwound because we can't afford them forever. So I think those are probably some of the reasons. Nicola, why do you think that's happening? Look, they lack confidence in this government's management of the economy. Traffic light settings, minimum wage additions, new public holidays. It all adds up and they're looking at those extra costs at the same time as people are really losing confidence in the economy. So it's tough for small business right now and I don't think they feel like this government has their back. Do you, David? Well, absolutely. I mean, reason New Zealand's growth rates are back up to pre-COVID levels is because of the supports that we've had as a government. I mean, it is hard for some businesses to find staff at the moment. Unemployment is so low. Wages are on the increase, but under Labor governments, we really do push wages up at the bottom. We note that in the other part of the political cycle, when nationals are in charge, they don't complain when the CEO salaries are going up through the roof. We have a different focus. James Shaw had a weird focus this week. He started by saying that we didn't need to cut the number of dairy cows we have in New Zealand and finished it by saying we did. Nicola, do we? No, we need to be much smarter about it than that. New Zealand has some of the most carbon-efficient farming in the world. We feed 40 million people. Should we strive to do it even more sustainably and with an even lower footprint? Yes. But technology and smart farming is the solution, not just killing cows. What about you, David? Do you think that we need to reduce our herd size? Well, look, we're not proposing a cap on cow numbers. I do think we're probably at peak cow in New Zealand already and that numbers will track down naturally. We do have parts of the country where our aquifers are polluted through nitrates in a way that makes it unsafe for the drinking water to be drawn from them. So we do need to do better. How we're approaching that is it's all you already need a resource consent for a new farm conversion and some areas you won't get it. In other areas, regional councils are asking farmers to reduce their nitrate pollution and they're doing that sometimes by reducing the number of their herd but they're not requiring imported feed to be brought into the farm just living off the grass that's grown on the farm so they're maintaining profitability that way. Okay, so that's a known from Nicola and it's going to happen anyway from David. Let's move on, talk about knowledge gaps, and this is that, you know, you would have been watching what's happened with the Australian election, and I'm not going to ask you guys what's the official cash rate and how much does a block of cheese cost? Because actually, I think you're both nerds and you'll know it. But I want to ask you about Megan Woods yesterday who was asked about the OCR, the official cash rate. And she's the housing minister, right? And she didn't know what it was. She had to Google it. Nicola, do you think that that's good enough? Or is that a sign that they don't know what they're doing? I was surprised by that because when you're the housing minister, you're dealing with people every day who are finding it tough to get into a house. And one of the reasons they're going to find it tougher over the next 12 months is their mortgage payments are going up. And of course, that's because we've had the biggest hike in the official cash rate in 22 years. So I was surprised to hear that that wasn't something that was top of mind for her. But I'm always conscious, Ryan, one day I'll get asked a number and I won't know it either. Exactly. That's why no one ever lays into their opponents because they know it's going to happen to them at some point. David, this is curious. Can you let us in on a little secret? I've always wondered. Do you, as a minister or even in opposition or whatever, do you have staff or officials that give you like a cheat sheet, like a piece of paper that says, you know, the OCR and how much is a two-liter milk, that kind of stuff? Look, every week when I prepare for this session, and both Nicola and I put in a lot of prep for these things, I have a sheet of statistics that I try and memorize. But it does feel like a game of gotcha as a politician, because I remember most of those numbers, but I don't remember all of them. What I do remember is that interest rates, even after the interest rate increase from the reserve bank, not the government, yesterday, there's still lower them when we took office. Nice way to finish. David Parker and Nicola Willis with us from Wellington this morning. Thanks so much for joining us, National and Labor. It's seven away from eight o'clock. I bet that line was on that sheet to memorize too. After the break, the way sex education is being taught in schools is changing.

The operator of the facility says they're so excited to get the public in. They've got food trucks coming on Saturday and Easter egg hunt on Sunday. So if you don't have any Easter plans this weekend, it sounds like a perfect opportunity for something new. Good option. Thanks, Jack. And if you're looking for something to do in Christchurch, Mitch, it's a blockbuster weekend for sport. Yeah, good morning, Mel. Christchurch is well and truly turning it on this Easter weekend with a blockbuster weekend full of sport. It all kicks off tomorrow night with the Crusaders taking on the Blues, well and truly putting the good in Good Friday. The Blues haven't won here since 2004, so if I chuck my red and black eye patch on for a minute, I'm pretty sure we'll be absolutely fine tomorrow. Then on Saturday afternoon, the tactics are taking on the stars. Earlier this week, it was only looking likely that 200 fans could turn up. But obviously with those traffic light settings changing yesterday, more than 2,000 fans will be able to head along on Saturday, which will be awesome. I've got my tickets for both, and I can't wait. Have a good one, Mitch. And let's go to Wellington. Ashley McCall, Ashley, the bus service to the airport back on. That's right, Mal. So good news for those people who aren't really keen to spend quite a bit to go out to Wellington Airport. They'll soon have that cheaper option of catching the bus again. So the airport service will start back up in July and we haven't actually had this service since the first nationwide lockdown back in March 2020. So if you're someone who usually spends maybe around $20 to $30 by a bus, by an Uber or a taxi, the maximum you'll spend on this service is $9.50. So nine new buses arrived in the capital this week for this route, which will start at Wellington Station. It will go along the Golden Mile through Kilbony to the airport. So some great news for those tourists who are coming back into the country and who might be clutching their wallets a bit tightly. Thank you to all our reporters, but a special thank you to you, Ash. We're going to miss you. That was your last cross for us here on AM. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years, and we wish you all the best for your new adventures. You'll be wonderful. We'll miss you. Thank you so much guys for having me. I've really enjoyed my time with you all. It's been a blast. I've loved everything from eating Big Macs to going down to the protest. And also if I start tearing up, it's because I'm just cutting up some onions here. That's why I'm crying, not because I'm leaving. It's because they're strong onions. Someone actually is cutting onions. Nice one, Ash. Oh, brilliant. Do you know what the trick is? You don't cut the root of it, and then you don't get the acid in your eyes. Ash, thank you very much. We've loved having you and wish you all the best for the future. It's 8 o'clock. This is AM. I didn't know she was going to do that. That was quite funny. It is Thursday the 14th of April. Thanks so much for joining us on AM this morning. Coming up, sex education in schools, getting a revamp. New resources being introduced. We discussed this. All the changes for your kids next. Right now. It's time for news. Morena, good morning. It is two minutes past eight. In breaking news this morning, there's a large police response in West Auckland this morning after a person barricaded themselves inside a property.

Now, there is a big police presence on Great North Road and Henderson Valley Road at the moment in West Auckland, and they have cordoned off the area as a measure of safety.

So do be safe, West Auckland, Great North Road, Henderson Valley Road. Nats Levy, thank you. There have been no evacuations overnight in Gisbon. A cyclone fairly eases its assault on the area.
