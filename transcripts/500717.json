A main road is closed as a scene examination takes place. Investigators remain tight-lit, surrender or die. Russia's deadline for Ukrainian fighters and Malayu-polled passes, as it launches more deadly and devastating revenge attacks on other parts of the embattled nation. Has it finally taken the important port city? And TikTok turns toxic, the social media influencer, who believes an online feud is behind an acid attack on her while she was streaming live. The cameras keep rolling throughout and after police hunt three masked men. No, my, Heidi, my welcome to One News. The identity of a man shot dead by police during a traffic stop in New Plymouth is yet to be healed, as investigators release few details about the incident. The road where the shooting took place last night remained blocked off this morning as investigators conducted a scene examination. The victim died at the scene. Police confirmed stopping a car on Devon Road, State Highway 3, near New Plymouth Airport. Before the fatal shooting they had stopped in, for more, let's go live to Cushler Norman near the scene. What's happening there right now, Cushler? Is the road still closed? Kiyoda, Melissa. Yes, State Highway 3 here on the outskirts of New Plymouth is still closed tonight, and it may be for some time as police carry out their scene investigation. We've seen lots of comings and goings of police and detectives today, but they're remaining tight-lipped about what happened exactly on this road at 9.30 last night. We don't, as you say, Melissa, know the name of the man that they shot. We don't know whether or not that the man, if they were armed. But we do know that it happened during a vehicle stop. We do know police tried to save the man but that he died at the scene. Next of Kin have now been notified. A post-mortem will be carried out and this shooting will be referred to the independent police complaints authority. And Cushula, you've come across a family who have been affected by that cordon behind you. Yes, I spoke to a mother whose two children was staying at a friend's house along this road last night. They heard the gunshots ring out, but they got stuck in the cordon, so they couldn't be reunited with their mother until 3 o'clock this afternoon. That was a rather stressful time for them all. This is what the mother told me. It was quite scary just because they've never been exposed to anything like this. Just knowing that you can't be right there and knowing how it can be with police, you can't get there straight away. I understand they've got to do their investigation, so I tried to give them time for that, but I wanted my children out as soon as possible. And we know also that police shootings are becoming more frequent. This is the first police shooting this year, but it is becoming more frequent. Last year there was a record breaking for police shootings the year before that. In 2020, there were three police shootings the year before that. In 2020 there were three. And the year before that, in 2019, there were also three. Now, Mahi, thanks very much, Cush, Le Norman in New Plymouth for us tonight. And, of course, get the latest on this story on our website. You just need to go to OneNews.co.n.z and our other digital platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The head pastor of one of New Zealand's biggest Pentecostal churches is stepped aside after allegations of the mistreatment of interns and volunteers. This week, Arise Church announced an external independent review which will look into the claims. More former members have come forward in recent days to tell One News reporter Logan Church their stories. Arise Church and damaged control. I'm awakening a dreamer in this room. Late last night and only hours before one of the best services of the year, its board issued a statement saying Pastor John Cameron has voluntarily stepped aside from his pastoral duties and along with Pastor Brent Cameron has also resigned from the board. This morning it was business as usual for the Easter service. I want to welcome you home if it's your first time. It's so good that you've joined us. But more claims about mistreatments are emerging. One news has been contacted by many who were interns here. Just do so much. I had no petrol and I had no food and I was getting really tired and I still had to pay for internship as well and I had to work in a retail part-time to survive and I was working my ass off with them. One former intern said they had to work on the pastor's properties. I worked on John Cameron's garden on several occasions, trimming his hedges, digging holes, seeding his grass and mowing his lawns, all while he was inside the house working on his Sunday message. Another former intern said they were diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, after working 50 hours a week, unpaid, and struggling to make ends meet. I worked three to four afternoons a week nannying. This gave me just enough money to pay my rent, petrol, electricity and left very little for food or anything else I needed. A Rice Church told one news, it won't comment on any specific allegations while its independent external review is underway. It did, however, acknowledge the hurts and pain that had been expressed. I thought I was the only one in this position, but, you know, I was in shock when I realised there's other people that felt the same as me, that felt hurt by their church. Hurt, they say, that will take a long time to heal. Logan Church, one news. To the conflict in Ukraine, the status of the besieged city of Malewpole is unclear tonight, after Russia gave an ultimatum for Ukrainian fighters to surrender or die. For the very latest, let's go to Simon Mercip, who's been following developments closely. Simon. Melissa, that Russian ultimatum to Maripol's last defenders took effect at 3 o'clock this afternoon, our time, that's 6 a.m. in Ukraine. Now, Russia is desperate to claim this city. The southern port would give it a so-called land bridge linking the eastern areas it holds with Crimea, which is also under its control. Now, Moscow says the last Ukrainian resistance is hold up near the steel plant. It says there are up to 2,500 fighters, Ukrainians and foreigners, trapped here. Now, these are recent pictures of Russian forces holding the city. They have blockaded it for weeks. The UN says Maripol and surrounding areas are being starved to death. And President Zelensky, well, he says if his forces in Maripol are killed, that would spell an end to peace talks. Now, as of a few minutes ago, there was still no word on whether those Ukrainian soldiers had accepted Russia's terms of surrender. Now, as grim as Maripol is, it's a similar story elsewhere in the east, where the Russian offensive also shows signs of intensifying. The shelling is relentless here. Civilians rushed for cover in the eastern town of Lysicansk, just near a supermarket. A transport depot was another target. Further to the north, Russian rockets struck the city of Kharkiv. A residential area was hit. With at least one person killed and 18 wounded. As hard hit as this region is, it's feared worse as to come. Yes, in truth is the Russians are preparing something massive in the east. We are determined to push them back and to fight till the very end, no matter which part of Ukraine it says, the capital or the east. And for a second day running, the capital was a target. Another military factory was hit. The floor was shaking and it felt like an earthquake. It was very frightening. These days, we sleep fully closed and with our back spacked, so we are ready to flee. And once again, Vladimir Zelensky called for help. The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be, and the sooner there will be peace. Right now, Russia seems determined to win that peace on the battlefield. In the last few hours, it's claimed to have shot down a Ukrainian plane carrying a shipment of Western weapons. Ukraine's resistance is under the pump. Simon Mursep, one news.

Back here, it affects the quality of health care you and your family receive. And ongoing doctor shortages are reaching crisis levels. This has prompted fresh calls to train more doctors in New Zealand. The Doctors Union estimates we need close to 3,000 more GPs and medical specialists to get on par per capita with staffing levels in Australia. The COVID-19 pandemic border restrictions and tough immigration rules making it harder to attract overseas staff. And an aging GP workforce are compounding the problem. We have just two med schools in New Zealand in Auckland and Otago, which produce around 550 graduates a year, a figure that's remained relatively static for more than a decade. Let's compare that to Australia, which is significantly up to its med student intakes. 21 universities nationwide offered training producing 3,600 medical graduates each year. Even allowing for its much bigger population, Australia's comparative graduate numbers are much higher than ours. Here's Nicole Bremner with more details, reaction, and what it could mean for you. Being a medical student in Townsville wasn't part of Daisy O'Connor's plan. If you told me five years ago that I'd be in final Queensland studying medicine, I would have thought you were joking. But she headed offshore, unable to secure a highly sought-after spot at med school here. I still have to pinch myself sometimes when I realise I'm doing what I always set out to do. I have wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. She's now committed to working in Australia for the foreseeable future and she's not alone. They take young people who miss out on the med schools here, don't they? Absolutely. It does make me sad because they're very unlikely to come back to New Zealand. He says it's time to increase medical school intakes here, starting with an additional 44 students in Auckland over the next six years. The population is increasing. It's increasing at the same rate as Australia. So Australia is producing significantly more graduates than we are. We need to take ownership of the problem. It's a complex problem that requires money, long-term planning, enough training spots for graduates in hospitals and general practice, and a willingness for young doctors to work where they need it. There is demand for more. The problem we have is the ability to get them supervision for their first and second year postgraduate years, and that's been a real block to allowing more people into our medical schools. National says it's time to be bold and dust off controversial plans for another medical school with a focus on rural health. Third medical school is likely to cost around about $300 million. Put it in context, this government spending $486 million on health reforms, layers and layers of bureaucracy. I think that our current medical schools, providing we can be sure that their graduates will have access to supervision at the end of their time, that those current medical schools have the capacity to train more students. More than 40% of our doctors are recruited from overseas, and while that's unlikely to change, there's general acceptance, more frontline Kiwi doctors are needed. More Maori and Pacific doctors, that can't be achieved by recruiting international medical graduates. Home-growing graduates tend to better understand that culturally competent context that gives us better outcomes in health. Australia's advice is to follow a detailed long-term plan and that training more doctors doesn't solve every problem. One of the mistakes we made is by believing that just an uptick to the number of students would just flow out to the regions that they'd need. That didn't work. Health officials are working on a strategy to future-proof our doctor workforce. In terms of New Zealand opening up more places, I think it's a fantastic idea. I think it's necessary. A plan too late for some young Kiwis now seeing their dreams come true across the Tasman. Nicole Bremner, one news. While there's widespread support for training more doctors here, it's not as straightforward as simply upping the intake. Nicole Bremner canvassed the best way forward with the chief medical officer at one of our busiest hospitals. Medicine's a huge part of Andrew Connolly's life. He's currently chief medical officer at Middlemore, one of the country's busiest hospitals. Should New Zealand be training more of its own doctors? Well I think the answer is fundamentally yes. The local trained doctors have been trained in our culture of medicine, which I think inherently brings advantages. Now, this is not to say that overseas trained doctors are poor, but I do support the view that training our own is ideal. But he's not sure following Australia's lead and training significantly more doctors is the answer. Australia, though, I don't think we should see as having solved the problem of a shortage of doctors because there's still the issue of distribution when people have graduated. And I think it's unclear whether their approach of a massive increase in medical student numbers is actually going to deliver the benefits that they desire. Australia, like New Zealand, needs more doctors in small towns and communities. What are the big challenges when it comes to getting doctors where they're needed in communities which need their services? That's a very big question. We do know where people have grown up does influence where they may wish to work. Where we train, in my view, is also important to allow people to have an insight into what it's like to live and work in parts of the country that currently are harder to staff. Some of Australia's medical schools have a rural focus and there's some support for the idea here. National supports a third medical school. what are your thoughts on one? I think the answer is no. I think working with the existing two to improve their programs, grow their programs, have a more coherent and consistent longitudinal view of what we need our graduates to be ready to do is where we'd put the money. That signals any change is still a long way off. I could certainly use more doctors in some parts of the hospital. There are some specialties where we know the workload has gone up over and above the staffing, but we're approaching a winter where we've got a lot of uncertainty about influenza, RSV as well as COVID. And so the doctors that work predominantly in those areas, we would like more. For now, though, doctors face a winter that's more of the same. Nicole Bremner, One News. An Australian TikTok has been attacked with a substance thought to be acid in Sydney's CBD and filmed the entire ordeal. New South Wales police are now searching for three men over the incident, which is believed to have been planned. Jordan Rudd has more. Sprayed in the face with a mystery substance, all while streaming live on TikTok. Come, I get a rum, my face, I need water. Alia, can't see. It depends. Are you water? Water. Water. Jenny Lhasaan my face only water Alia can't see Jenny L Hassan was filming outside a Chinatown restaurant in Sydney on Friday night when she was surrounded by three masked men one of them throwing what's believed to be acid before speeding off in a black Mazda SUV The 32-year-old screamed for help, still recording on her phone. Oh, yeah, I can't breathe. Emergency services were called as Miss Al Hassan struggled to breathe, taking her to Royal North Shore Hospital. She had a burn marks on my neck. The burn marks cross my head. She's since been discharged with minor injuries. I could feel it burning my skin. The top layer of my head. She's since been discharged with minor injuries. I could feel it burning my skin. The top layer of my eye, it's coming off. I have an appointment with a doctor in a couple of days. New South Wales police are investigating possible links to organised crime and say it was a targeted attack. It's heinous as an attack. We're obviously the investigation's in its early stages and we're looking to determine the precise motive. We are aware of certain social media, a video that's currently being circulated. Miss Al-Hassan posted this clip on TikTok earlier in the day. It is what it is, you know. I barked up a wrong tree and I've got the consequences. Consequences she'll be feeling for some time as the search continues for the trio behind this brazen attack. Jordan Rudd, One News. Amiriakenei coming up, it's goodbye to diplomacy by Zoom.

For the first time in more than two years, the Prime Minister is flying abroad for face-to-face trade talks. Jessinda Adirner is travelling to Singapore and Japan with a clear message that New Zealand is now open for business. Political editor Jessica Much Mackay is covering the talks and sent this report. It's a little piece of New Zealand that's very popular in Singapore and Japan. Last month alone, more than a million trays of Zespri yellow kiwi fruit left for Japan. These markets are really important to CESPRI. They actually represent about $800 million worth of sales. The aim is to boost that number now we can meet face-to-face again. Zesprey is part of the group of businesses travelling with the Prime Minister. And there is absolute joy and delight to be able to do this face-to-face. We've been so long without it. Jacinda Ardurne says Omicron put a stop to be able to do this face-to-face. We've been so long without it. Jacinda Ardurn says Omicron put a stop to her trip to Australia last year. And that's away criticism, she should have been travelling more. I was always willing, however, to take up the isolation period that would be required on return. But equally, some of the markets we would wish to visit weren't necessarily open to visitors. I think Zoom diplomacy, virtual diplomacy, is good, but it's not a way to build new relationships. And so Japan has a new Prime Minister, Prime Minister Keshida, so he and Prime Minister Adirn haven't met in person. Those relationships matter because Singapore and Japan are our fourth and fifth biggest trading partners. And there's a lot to catch up on pandemic aside. Top of everybody's agenda right now is the war in Ukraine. National says the Prime Minister needs to push for support to attract the US back to the Trans-Pacific Trade Deal after Donald Trump pulled out. I think there is greater opportunity or potential now than a year or two ago. I absolutely expect that one of the big topics of conversation will be the CPTPP. But the former trade minister says we've got work to do after New Zealand initially included Singapore in changes to our property ownership rules. It caught the Singapore government by surprise. I understand they read about it in the newspaper. They were deeply unhappy about that. Actually, the Prime Minister needs to get there and fix that relationship. The Prime Minister disagrees. We have now, what I would consider, a fantastic relationship. Through COVID, we've maintained contact throughout. COVID testing will be a fixture of the trip, with the possibility the Prime Minister might have to isolate in Singapore for a week if she tests positive. Jessica Muchmachai, 1 News. Rising food and petrol prices have become a major issue as a rate of inflation sky rockets, but we're not alone. The war in Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic and supply chain problems are sending shock waves through global economies, causing widespread unrest. Katie Bradford reports. On the streets of Shanghai, Colombo, Nairobi, New York. The economic pain is the same. More than two years into a pandemic, the streets of Shanghai have veered from being eerily quiet to an unusual sign of dissent in the form of protests. But a shutdown here in Shanghai affects the rest of the world. We've had significant issues in terms of poor access over the last few months, and that's clearly continuing. Demand-wise, I mean, a lot of the products that we sell into China, of course, are food-based products, which are still needed and required. But clearly there are major supply chain issues. We already had the pandemic, and then the war in Ukraine, adding to the global trend of rising food and fuel prices. The global economy looks a bit stuffed at the moment. We continue to see some real challenges emerging across the world. In Spain, it's led to protests calling for emergency intervention by the government. There are 58 demonstrations this afternoon throughout the country to say that effective measures must be taken to reduce prices in Spain. Food prices, particularly wheat, are being pushed up because of the war. Nearly one third of all wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia. It is estimated that we are importing about 60% of the total wheat consumption in Kenya. Even if Russia has wheat, we cannot access that wheat. And that becomes a disadvantage for us. And that's why it's important to really focus on us being able to grow our own food. Exports have come to a standstill, hitting dozens of countries, especially those in the Middle Eastern Africa. I don't understand how the war in Russia or Ukraine can affect in so little time, can affect the prices, the food prices here in Kenya. Those on low incomes are hit hard in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, it's led to political upheaval. Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis in history with increasing calls for the government's resignation. In Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan has been ousted amidst political turmoil, coupled with soaring inflation and unemployment, a new leader now sworn in. Closer to home, Australians are battling costs as politicians fight an election campaign. You'll definitely see increasing price at the supermarkets and also those other essential items. And in the United States, inflation hit 8.5% this week a 40-year high. My rent is absolutely ridiculous. I come to the food banks every week. The president making it clear who he thinks is to blame, calling it the Putin price hike. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. The twoest largest grain producers in the world, China and Ukraine and Russia, are not doing what they usually do, so everything's going up. We saw today's inflation data. 70% of the increase in prices in March came from Putin's price hike in gasoline. It's hurting him at the polls too, so he's making higher biofuel blends of gas available to curb soaring fuel costs and to cut reliance on foreign energy sources. Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide and a half a world away. And just like here, interest rates are expected to keep rising around the world. The bad news, there's no sign of any relief anytime soon. We are going to find it harder and more expensive to grow as we move forward, and households are going to feel the pinch hard as that very easy money goes away and is replaced with a much more tough, much more usual set of circumstances at a time when we've got very high debt and we're still trying to get over that COVID hangover. The good news, unemployment is low across the world, creating a tight labour market and leading to the hope that wages will keep rising. Katie Bradford, One News. Pope Francis has condemned the cruelty of the war in Ukraine at an Easter vigil mass. The 85-year-old didn't preside over the service at St Peter's Basilica, instead making an address.

It's the first time the couple have appeared in public together in Europe since stepping back as senior royals in 2020. The games were created by the Prince for wounded veterans and serving soldiers. Team Ukraine has lost four members in combat since the start of the Russian invasion. Many of the team will return to frontline duties once the Games end. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Harry said the world was united with Ukraine. The Queen won't join other members of the Royal Family for an Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle. It'll be the first time in more than 50 years the 95-year-old monarch has missed the service. The Queen is scaling back her public engagements due to mobility problems. She recently recovered from a mild dose of COVID-19 and is said to still be very tired. The Board of Social Media Platform Twitter has a plan to deny Elon Musk upright ownership of the company.

Very angelic. And death. This is lovely dear. Best for the best, huh? Yep. Very emotional to hear the chanting from our old people. Beautiful to listen to. The new season of the Cascarters Tuesday on one. Fancy glass of gin on a picturesque mountain top. Why not? Tourist operators are getting creative as a race to attract overseas visitors begins. Joy Reid looks at a campaign in Kaikala, encouraging businesses to work together. Some places just sell themselves. These are a group of dusky dolphins. Probably around 4 to 500 there at the moment. Also, you'd think... Hold on to your steak and chips, here we go. But even with vistas like... These are a group of dusky dolphins, probably around 4 to 500 there this at the moment. Also, you'd think... Hold off here's steak and chips, here we go! But even with vistas like these on Kaikoda's doorstep, it's having to be innovative. Here we go. Meet Dan Stevenson, a helicopter pilot, and Justine Schroeder. How does that look? The region's only gin distiller. Lots of ice. We do like a nice bit of ice. The pair of only gin distiller. Lots of ice. We do like a nice bit of ice. The pair of developed Kikoda's newest tourist attraction. What a beautiful sound. A gin experience on top of Mount Fife. Jeez. What we wanted to do with our collaboration was bring something to the table that was so unique and so interesting and never been done before, that it will encapsulate the international market. That international market now firmly in their sights is our borders reopen. It's been a long two years, and even though we've diversified somewhat, the international market's still really key to most of our businesses here. But there's no flood of arrivals yet. If we look at, say, the April school holidays from 2019 to the April school holidays that were about to start in New Zealand, the flights coming over to New Zealand from Australia at about 25% of what they were in 2019. New Zealand is spoiled for choice with picturesque hotspots, but the challenge for places like Kikoda, where tourism makes up 40% of its GDP, is how to attract the lucrative tourist dollars when there are only so many of them to go round. You know, we are competing against other regions within the area, so we do need to make our products stand out more than others. An element of competition. That's so exciting. Tantalising taste bans and tourists alike. Joy Reid, One News. A fungal disease on Fjordland's Anka Island is threatening to ruin a successful breeding season for the endangered Kakapo. But high-tech support from the mainland is helping some new chicks in their fight to survive. Maddie Lloyd with this story. They're only a few weeks old, but these Kakapo chicks are already getting a lot of attention. What we're doing is just a bit of diagnostics, so we're double-checking to make sure that these chicks don't have any signs of a lung infection or any other underlying disease. That's because they've been exposed to aspergillosis, a potentially fatal fungal disease, which has already claimed one adult bird's life this season. It's a very difficult to detect disease. So the best way that we can actually detect it in a bird is to get a CT scan. Being on a remote island, that's not possible. So they're being sent to Dunedin's Wildlife Hospital for scans. So it's a kind of disease that can progress really quickly, and when you catch it in the late stages, is very, very difficult to treat. These machines drastically increasing the chance of survival, but the hospital doesn't have its own, so Ag researchers Invermei campus in Mosquil is helping out. As a charity, it's really important to us that we have cost savings, so they allow us to do CT scans at a much lower price. The facility usually scans livestock. We've never had animals that are this precious, you know, come through the scanner. So endangered species, this is the first time I think we've actually scanned anything that fits in that category. Five chicks have been diagnosed so far all doing well under specialist care thanks to a new partnership that's said to stay. They'll be able to help not only Kākopal, but a whole range of the incredible wildlife that goes through, Dunedin Wildlife Hospital. Giving more of our native species the best chance of survival. Mary Lloyd, One News. All right, Sav is here with sport, and the Phoenix are finally home. Our first trans-Tasman team, yes, back home, Melissa. Can they win at home then and stay in A-League finals? Their fans certainly hope so, turning out in big numbers this afternoon. Happy days as well, if you're a Liverpool fan in the UK. Plus, not quite home just yet. The Warriors take on the roosters at the famous SCG, and wrapped in foil. What an Easter for cycling pro Patti Bevan as he nears a career first. This is our kitchen. It's very earthy, smelling.

What a day and what a way to welcome the Phoenix back to their Wellington Fortress after a six-month-stit in Australia, plenty of hometown heat, as the Knicks took on the central coast this afternoon. No-a-ki-N-A-Korri-Kinikina Ote-Wa. No, ma'a, hairee to Tekei-A-Welington Phoenix. Yes, it had all the makings of a classic today for fans in the capital. Dewee Priest was on deck early. Here's how it all panned out. A reunion long in the making. A special homecoming not just reserved for the players. It's great to not be the only ones wearing the next jerseys. People are still giving us some weird looks over Dolly, but most people know who she is. Dolly the sheep, along with her handlers Holly and Dean, among the regulars in the Phoenix Little Corner of Yellow. The often loaned support for the team in Australia over the past two seasons. We realise we represent a lot of people back here. So it's kind of like little corner of yellow, but we're also the tip of the iceberg. Winlose or draw to be here with my family and support the Phoenix. And by family, I mean all us in yellow. A Phoenix family that grew to include the women's team this season, whose Captain Lily Alfeld couldn't resist coming along today. The girls can't wait to get the chance to play here. And we had such amazing support from, you know, when we were over in Aussie. But just to be able to feel it and have, you know, have it in here in person will be amazing. Also among that Aussie contingent Matt and Hannah, who kindled their relationship on train journeys back and forth to Wollongong to cheer on the Knicks. I'd say it was under duress at the start, but now I'm a fan, what can I say? Matt's persistence clearly paying off. And it happens to coincide the perfect Phoenix weekend, so we're here at the match as well. Was it an easy yes? Oh, of course. Easy. How could you say no to this space? On a Wellington stunner, everything going perfectly to script, except for the game itself. Now the Mariners on a tick. Here is in Cololo from one end to the other. Over 18,000 fans silenced not just once, but four times by the Mariners. Here's Matt Hitch. And the cherry on top is applied. The Mariners have crashed the Easter party in Wellington. Very disappointing defensive performance again. It was about presenting a performance and a result for all the people that have come out tonight and deserve the fixture after two hard years. Really disappointed to let them down. For the first time in over five months, the Phoenix can recover at home. No doubt needing plenty of TLC to take the edge of today's anticlimactic return. Dewey Priest, One News. Well, in the UK, it looks like Liverpool might have Manchester City's number. A draw last week in the Premier League, now Liverpool beating City 3-2 in a commanding performance in the FA Cup semi-final in the Sun at Wembley. Not all, but some city fans hardly covered themselves in glory before the first whistle, chanting during the minute silence on the 33rd anniversary of the Hillsborough tragedy. This caused anger among the Liverpool faithful, clearly motivating their team as well. It was attacked and headed in by Kanate. And it just happened to be at the city end. The two sides battled to a tall draw last weekend at the top of the Premier League. Today a very different story, two goals in 17 minutes. Different style of holding midfielder. Oh dear me. City deciding to use their backup keeper for the semifinal. Maybe the wrong decision. How about making the right split-second decisions? A footballing lesson in patience, positioning and power. Alexander Arnold. Tiago to Mane. That is some finish. What about the build-up as well? And the indignity of American goalie, Zach Stephan, being beaten on the near post. City's hopes of a treble extinguished by half-time, while Liverpool is still in the hunt for an historic quadruple. The Reds have lost just three times out of 52 games played this season. I think the first half was one of the best we ever played. We did all the right stuff. We scored the right moments. City fought back with two goals to make for a grandstand finish deep into stoppage time. However, Liverpool's first half domination was too much to haul back. They take on either Chelsea or Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final in four weeks. In the NRL, the Warriors winning streak has come to an abrupt end. Not before some controversial moments, though, in a 22-14 loss. To the roosters late this afternoon in Sydney, Matt Manukia has more. With the harv's combination of Sean Johnson and Chanel Harris-Tavita being bashed around, Warriors' captain Adin Fanoa Blake single-handedly took the fight back to the roosters. Now going forwards and still going, takes on the fullback who makes the trisover. Quick play the ball and the referee says... The referee said penalty, but no sin bin for James Tedesco. The Warriors taking the two points, though, then coming back to really make them pay. The hit's lead over, and the Warriors scored the first try as well. The hits kept coming courtesy of Jared Wairia Hargreaves on report, but it was a set play strike the Warriors felt the most. I'm here, the Roosters. Tedesco holds it up, patch and pass. Tupo in the corner. Penalty, right in front of the post, the roosters level the scores at eight all. But the Warriors showing resilience stayed in the fight and looked set to be rewarded. A big hole opened up and it comes loose. Cue that old debate, was it a strip or a knock on. Rees Walsh loses the ball on the field of playing. We have a decision. A huge moment as momentum swung straight back the other way. Try coming up here for Kevin Nangarva. Short side again. Walker, spinning his way through. Down 20 to 8. What better time for Rees Walsh to finally inject himself into the game. A second, how's that for a kick? Remarkable for Wattetti's the least. The wing it fell over. Rees Walsz, that is wizardry from the fullback, right up the middle he went. Back to just six points, but still no love from the bunker. A blatant Adam Pompey penalty giving the roosters the two points needed to secure a second straight comeback win in front of the old guard at Sydney Cricket Ground. Matt Manukia, 1 News. The Southern Steel have ended the Mystics' golden run, serving the Aucklanders just their second loss of the Premiership Netball season in start contrast to their 20-goal loss when the sides met in round two, the steel, giving mid-quarter Shannon Saunders a 150th National League game to remember. The steel taking home to signalling someone to ball time. Oh, can Burley, take a bow. Gets the tip. Wolf cleans up. Brilliant. Brilliant. The hops on that. The steel taking home to Georgie Salter trophy with a 64 to 59 win, a tribute to 59 win, a tribute to the legendary coach from the deep south. Well, Turkish delight rather than Easter eggs today for Kiwi cyclist Patrick Bevan, moving to the cusp of the biggest victory of his career. Bevan has stormed into the lead of the Tour of Turkey after a victory today on stage 7. Guy Havelte has Paddy's big peddling push. On a stretch of road, not far from a place enshrined in our history, Patrick Bevan put himself in position to claim his own piece of Kiwi sporting triumph. He's got the race lead and he's got this seventh stage. Bevan expertly winning stage 7 of the tour of Turkey up the road from the Gallipoli Peninsula, the Kiwi riding to perfection, surging late to not only claim the line on us, Bevan expertly winning stage 7 of the tour of Turkey up the road from the Gallipoli Peninsula. The Kiwi riding to perfection, surging late to not only claim the line honours, but the general classification lead into tonight's last stage. I've shouldered a lot of the burden of that last break. I did a lot of the work and the stage was fully on the line. And fortunately it played into my hands at the end and I managed to win it. So I'm really, really happy with that. The two is Bevan's first competitive race back since breaking his collarbone earlier in the year. For most of the 135 kilometre journey, happy to bide his time in the Palaton, but always sitting as a threat. As if on cue, we see the arrival of the Israel Premier Tank squad on the front. Bevan safely nestling in the wheels. Making that threat a reality on the last serious climb of the stage. Bevan and Vine are looking to try and distance to subpovita who's been caught napping. Bevan turning an 11-second deficit into a 20-second advantage, crediting his team, including Kiwi teammate Corbyn Strong, for pushing him into the lead. One more stage to go. It's going to be a nervous stage, but I've just come back from injury. It was my first race back since an injury at the start of the year, so to kind of come here with such a good form is a really nice feeling. An even better feeling if he can navigate the 136 kilometres around Istanbul and claim the biggest win of his career. Guy Havalt 1 News. A six-man Samoa has pushed the All-Black Sevens right to the wire in their final pool game at the Vancouver round of the World Seven series. Paul Scanlan's red card tackle left Samor a man down for most of the game. New Zealand then running in three first half tries and threatening, in fact, to run away with the whole game. However, the second half went way beyond expectations. We've gone through, right through the middle. Nui, does he have enough? He goes all the way out wide. Oh, Nure. Real good energy from Samoa. Maliko. On the side. Everyone's stepping. Everyone's on it. Oh, there's a head high. But Maliko gets in. New Zealand winning 3124 to top their pool. That means a quarter-final against Australia tomorrow morning. Well, back here it was a super rugby Pacific game that had a bit of everything. Just not a much-needed win for the Highlanders. Early on in Dunedin against the Hurricanes, the land has lost lock Josh Dixon to a red card for head contact. But the southern men slowly fought their way back into the lead, a mix of grinding and running. And a game featuring 60 kicks and 30 lineouts, the last 10 minutes exploded. Morgan, away for Julian Salvia, Ryasi and a bit of space. Looks to get on the outside, needs to slip the pass, and the try scored. Not only tries each way late in the match, mix in some allegations of foul play as well. You know, we had a red card for a contact of the head, and one of our guys blatantly gets a black eye, and touches and refs just walk it off like it's nothing. The Highlanders almost pulling off a victory in the last play of the game. Driving towards the line. He's over the line. How did he get it there? Officials ruling no clear grounding from Prop Solomau. The ball held up. Try disallowed the canes hang on 22 to 21. Well, the way Kiwis love adopting niche sports to then become global masters at them is legend. So it might not be too long before someone, you know, wants to sign up for Sepak Takro. It's gaining a foothold here thanks to a group of refugees who didn't have to leave everything behind when they fled their war-torn homeland. Here's Kimberley Downs. Welcome to Sepak Takro. Think a mix of volleyball, football and flips. Popular in Southeast Asia, kickball hadn't been seen in New Zealand until now. Meet Emu U, arriving in New Zealand in 2016 as a refugee. He's one of many Korean people from the Myanmar-Tailand border displaced by war. Emu bringing his love of Sepak Takro with him. I enjoy doing all the flips and tricks and it makes me to travel new places. With the help of Manaco Football Club and the New Zealand Corrine Association, a national tournament was born. A lot of the communities that come to resettle here in Aaltera are resettling in other communities around the country. And so this is an event, an opportunity to bring those communities back together again and celebrate through something they have in common, a sharing of this love for Sipakakak Kuo. Now in its second year, it's growing fast. I was born in Thailand in a refugee cap. Came here when I was 10, sponsored by UNICEF. He's brought back a lot of memory to see the sport. They'll be playing in New Zealand again because it hasn't been seen for quite a while. More teams, more opportunities and more time to practice. It's hard when you start doing the flips and tricks. You have to be very flexible. It takes confidence and curious. You have to be really passionate on it. Despite not being recognised as a sport here yet, MU's self-funded team play proudly under the Kiwi banner. Winning bronze at world championships in 2019 with hopes for better come July in Thailand. Ready and excited. Because COVID, so we stop it for two years. Now we're back again. MU hopes one day Sipakakuro will be an Olympic sport. But for now, it's reconnect now we're back again. MU hopes one day Si Park Takro will be an Olympic sport, but for now, it's reconnecting people across the country. Kimberly Downs, One News. Great to see a new sport in the country. Yeah, that's good. Don't know if I'd be trying it, though. The flexibility isn't what it used to be. I reckon you would have high-kicked a few of us out of the way of the Easter eggs. Especially in these pants. Good way to burn off the Easter eggs, though. It is sad. You ate a few.

Hello again. Lots of sunshine over both islands for Easter celebrations today. However, northern and eastern areas had some cloud and a few showers. It was chilly at first for southern areas, with Alexandra and Dunedin waking to zero. A ridge of high pressure holds over southern and central New Zealand tomorrow, but a rainmaker will sink down from the north with the engine room centered over the north Tasman Sea. So, heavy rain warnings in place for the north thunderstorms and strong easterly winds are in the mix. Kaitaya and Fangare sharing a top of 22. Auckland periods of rain and easterleys are strong and exposed places. 21 is your high. Hamilton mostly cloudy but you will get occasional rain from midday and a top of 20. Cloudy skies over the centre north to rain on and off across your afternoon and easterly winds through here. Pōonga, a cloudy day is on the cards and you will need a raincoat after lunch. Easterlies pick up by late morning and 21 degrees. code after lunch. Easterlees pick up by late morning and 21 degrees. Cloudy out east showers from afternoon for Gisbon falls developing around evening for Hawkes Bay. Sunshine dominates out west, New Plymouth. We'll get a few showers later on and a top of 21. Wellington, a fine day for the capital city, south-eastilees, and 19 is your high. It's going to be fine apart from some morning cloud over the top of the south, 18 degrees for Kaikora. Christchurch, some cloud at first, otherwise it's a fine day for you, nor easterlees, and a high of 17. The sun is shining through here. Light winds and Temito, you may get some fog at first. 17 is your high. Queenstown, a foggy morning for you too. Then fine and 18 degrees. And fine weather is the order of the day for the south. Fog in the morning is possible through here. Dunedin's some cloud as you sip your morning cup but it's going to be a fine day 17 is your high. So Tuesday Anna Ridge builds over the South Island while a complex low lies to the north of the country. The low extends a rain band down over the North Island which then moves onto the west coast of the South Island into Wednesday and that is your weather. Hope everyone has had their fill of Easter eggs today. Yes. I'm staying to look like one. Take care. Enjoy the rest of your evening. Goodsords. Broad to you by Foursquare. Tonight's Good Sort believes in karma and is a dab hand at fixing cars. But Lindsay Watt has also turned his helping hands to just about everything. Hayden Jones caught up with him in Christchurch. I was just going to tighten up that has hand of ours. Lindsay Watt's house is full of cars that haven't moved in quite some time. Even his toolbox is on wheels. I'll just wipe the dipstick. Which is kind of ironic given Lindsay Spencer's weekdays fixing other people's cars. So I actually basically do minor repairs for people at cost price. Cost price. Also no one is next to nothing. Gives me something to fill my day in. Cars like Joe Crawfitts. I'll fix all sorts of cars. This is Joe. I met him at karaoke. I don't even have to be drunk to the sink. Joe nominated Lindsay because... Lindsay's been fixing my car for a wee while now. How long's a wee while? About 20 years, yeah. You also does a free call-out service. And not just for cars. During Zoe's bike that she got for Christmas. That's Shirley. Because he likes to help people. Lindsay fixes her windows, mows her lawns. Well, if you can mow your own lawns, it's cheaper than the contractor. And wrestles with bike assembly. I don't like things beating me. I'm just out here watching my granddad work on cars. Back at Lindsay's, we meet his grandson, Dan. Snitchat. Snapchat. Who's Snapchating my every move. Hi, camera crew. Lindsay has been caring for two of his grandkids full time since they were very young. My daughter struggled to look after Dan. They're now teenagers. He's comfy sometimes. But he's generally all good. And although his yard could do with a little clean-up, Lindsay spends his weekends cleaning toilets for the council in some far-flung places. People at Akerra, they say, oh, these are beautiful toilets. Lindsay is in advertising for more work. All done. He just can't say no when someone asks for help. I think he knows how it is for people and, yeah, has a heart really. Maybe that's what a good sort is. He's amazing. He's been my best friend for a very long time. I believe in karma. What you give at, you get a pack of return. Hayden Jones. You know, it's just, that's just me. One News. Tenor Pai, Lindsay, and you can check out Goodsorts on our website.
