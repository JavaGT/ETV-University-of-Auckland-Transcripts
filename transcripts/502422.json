Actually, there's some really important things we need to discuss today on the show. I'm sure it will come up at a number of times throughout the show this morning. As well as that, though, confronting COVID as cases spike, we can expect new government measures to control the latest outbreak. The Prime Minister has promised we won't be returning to the red traffic light setting, but why are parts of the South Island now getting more than their share of new cases? And overseas, a state of emergency, Sri Lanka's military are told to restore order as the president flees the country after days of protests. We'll have full details in your news. Tapiriatu Ketina plus gang powers. Police are given more teeth to tackle organised crime, including new search mandates and measures to beat money laundering. We discuss whether they are on the right track or is it a reaction to recent political criticism. That conversation coming up at around about 20 to 7 this morning. Right now though it is 6 o'clock here's in Dior with the latest news. As COVID numbers continue to climb, free masks and rack tests are expected to be announced by the government today. There were over 11,000 daily COVID cases yesterday, up from 10,000 this time last week. It comes as a new B5 sub-variant is likely to soon be the dominant strain. Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker says everyone is at high risk at the moment because the virus is so present in the community. We could easily see a peak of Omicron infections to rival the peak we saw earlier this year. I mean, we're already seeing case numbers track up, but I think it's very concerning. We're seeing so many people in hospital, and we're seeing heading up towards 20 people a day dying from this infection. One News understands changes around vaccinations will also be announced today. And a state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka as mass protests continue over the country's economic crisis. With current president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country, the acting president has turned to the military to restore what he calls normalcy. The BBC's Anbarasan Etterajan has the latest. Another day of chaos and violence in Sri Lanka. This time, angry anti-government protesters are attempting to break into the office of Prime Minister Ranil Vikram Shingya. They want him to step down. As they tried to storm the building, security forces responded with tear gas. Fier's clashes broke out. But the barricades were no match for the furious, undesperate crowds who have suffered due to the economic collapse. The existing president, Gotabaya Rajapakshah, has fled to the Maldives. In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Ranil Vikram Singh says he is taking additional charge. We cannot allow this fascist political ideology to spread in this country. I have given all the necessary powers to the military to bring stability. There have been shortages of fuel as well as food and medicines after the government earlier this year ran out of foreign currency. Schools are closed, hospitals struggling. Protests have been going on for weeks, but today marks another dramatic escalation. Sri Lanka is going through an unprecedented crisis. Things can get ugly if no compromise is reached. In staying overseas, Joe Biden has arrived in the Middle East on his first trip to the region as US president. The president landed in Israel, where he aimed to promote stability and persuade Washington's Gulf allies to pump more oil into the country. He will also be speaking with Israeli leaders before continuing on to the occupied West Bank and Saudi Arabia. CCTV footage detailing how the Uvaldi school shooting unfolded has been released, fueling criticism of the delayed response from law enforcement. The video shows officers approaching the door of the delayed response from law enforcement. The video shows officers approaching the door of the classroom with the gunman inside, then retreating for more than an hour after he opened fire. But the decision to release the footage has enraged victims' families who hadn't seen the video themselves first. They were going to see the video, but they didn't need to see the gunmen coming in and hear the gunshots. They don't need to relive that. They've been through enough, and that was the most chicken way to put this video out today. Whether it was released by the DPS or who it was released for, in my opinion, was very unprofessional, which this investigation has been, in my opinion, since day one. 19 students and two teachers were killed in the shooting at Rob Elementary School. And to sport, I'm sure Jenny May walked out on purpose for this one story, but it's being dubbed one of the greatest state of origin wins ever. Gee, J.B., as Queensland claimed, a spectacular series deciding game in Brisbane. Queensland opened the scoring through Valentine Holmes after a fiery opening 10 minutes. And their lead was short-lived as the blues answered back with two of their own before half time. It's Geron Lai. He's put down centrefield on the 10. Here's something cooking here. You bet it is. Jenkins Sifini scores the try for New South Wales. Moments after the break, Queensland, winger, Dane Gagai and Bluesback Matt Burton were sent off for this punch-up. But the second half belonged to Queensland as they put on a dazzling display to run in three tries to humble their interstate rivals. All right. Oh, great. That's been punched by Dan Hintz. Go! Bras to the final win The final sport by Ben Hunt it's the third state of origin win. win. When you come in here it was going to be something special and we did it again. It's so good. It's up here, darling. It's all here, darling. The news is not over. Look, to show you how much a series win meant to Queensland, these are the scenes and the sheds after the match. Oh, let's move on. It's still going. To show you how much a series was meant to Queensland, these are the scenes and the sheds after the match. Oh, let's move on. And it's still going. Maroon's winger, Kaelin Ponga, was named Man of the Match of Ford. Patrick Carrigan was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as player of the series. Just so you know, the Silver Ferns played last night too. The NZA team. Silver Ferns, heading off to Commonwealth Games. If it was the blues, I'm sure we'd be spending a lot longer in the story. But anyway, there you go, Dean. Happy, good morning. Let's start off with the weather. Look, we are starting off with the warning for this morning, but it's not too bad, not as bad as yesterday. A heavy rain warning in place from midday in Northland. This will stick around until early tomorrow morning. So please take care out there, take proportions on the road. Make sure you drive to the conditions. Now to the top of the Motu, we've got rain developing this morning, heavier falls expected. From this morning all the way through to this afternoon, Auckland and Fittiyanga, you'll have a cloudy morning briefly before you join everybody else with that heavy falls later on. 16 degrees is a high there. And heading south, it's a cloudy day here. We've got heavy falls in Taurong and Fakataan. And possible showers for everybody else are later this afternoon. 13 degrees, the high in Taupo. And now to the East Coast. It's a fine day for most of you. We're coming up here on the map. Right on the east, it will become cloudy later this afternoon. You can expect some evening rain if you're there in Gisbon, but the rest of you are going to enjoy a much better day than you've been having this week. Marsitin, beautiful morning there, 14 degrees is your high. And crossing to the west, cloudy with a few morning showers. Those showers should ease later on this afternoon. You will get strong winds in the capital, though. 14 degrees are high there in Wellington. And to the South Island, Pewiponamu, you're in for a cloudy day? Westport, all the way to Hokitika. You will get lighter showers in yesterday and some beautiful sun there in Greymouth and Hockey Teca later on this afternoon. You guys deserve it. 13 degrees is the high bear. And by the south, a cloudy start to the day. You can expect some tequila later on this afternoon. You guys deserve it. 13 degrees is the high bear. And further south, a cloudy start to the day. You can expect some fine breaks later on this afternoon. 8 degrees the high for Alexandra. And to the deep south, it's a wet day here as well. Showers for almost all of you. Some fine breaks expected just after lunch today. Milford Sound is going to be a gorgeous day today. Eight degrees is a high for you. Much better than yesterday. Yeah, although, um, can I just go back to a crucial story that was in our news bulletin? Yeah, you're more than welcome. I wanted to ask you a question. Was that the outfit you were meant to be wearing this morning? I wondered why you'd done a costume change. What happened? I don't want to talk about it, actually. She was wearing a maroon dress. Jenny Mae came down wearing maroon this morning, and all of a sudden someone pointed out. And she went, I can't be having this. I can't be wearing maroon on a morning like this morning. Yeah. Thankfully, it was pointed out to me that I was wearing. Who pointed out? Hala. I just left it. Because they, our friends and Dera. That's what family does for one another. Yeah. Let me check Dean's message to us. I know. No, no, no. We've already had words this morning. Yeah, he's a good marooning. Anyway, let's move on, shall we? Yeah, let's move on, sure. Yeah, all right. It is nine minutes past six to the US now where a mass gun reform protest has just wrapped up outside the Capitol. Families affected by the recent mass shootings gathered in Washington to urge politicians to do more to stop the surge of gun violence currently plaguing the United States. In particular, the group wants a ban on automatic weapons. Correspondent Catherine Furkin joins us live from New York. Morina, Catherine, good to see you. Thank you for being with us again this morning. Tell us about this protest because this was actually organised by a group of mums who say, they're sick of the gun violence that is currently happening in the US. So tell us about the March 4th movement. Good morning, Jenny May. Yes, this new protest movement is called March 4th and it is in direct response to the July 4th parade shooting. It happened only a little over a week ago in Chicago. Hundreds of people have just finished gathering outside the US Capitol. They're calling on politicians on both sides of the political spectrum to agree to a national ban on assault weapons. Now, this was obviously a very emotional and heated protest outside, but the fact that this group was able to be established and mobilized so quickly, it's only been a week since those Independence Day shootings just really shows you the political sentiment around gun violence here at the moment. The group included families from the Highland Park, Chicago area, where that Independence Day shooting happened. It also included people from the Uvaldi, Texas area, where we saw that horrific school shooting that happened in late May. Yeah, gosh, so much fear and anger in the US at the moment because it should have been a time when actually, well, not a celebration, but actually applauding President Biden who passed a new federal gun law just recently, right? So tell us about that new legislation and why many say that it actually doesn't go far enough. Yeah, that's a good point. Only two days ago, President Biden delivered a speech at the White House where he was celebrating the passing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and that's a gun measure that has provisions for safer schools and also for increased mental health checks for potential gun buyers. But as you mentioned, many people fear this just simply does not go enough. It actually was a historic moment for the Biden administration. It's actually the first time that any gun safety measure bill has been passed in 30 years. But the importance of that moment was overshadowed by an audience member at the speech who started heckling Biden mid-speech. That audience member was the father of a 17-year-old who died in the Parkland shooting in Florida in 2018. And as the president started speaking, the father yelled out, more needs to be done. That is definitely the sentiment here, Jenny May, particularly when it comes to automatic weapons. Biden's new reform really doesn't touch the surface of automatic weapons. And you only need to look at the data of recent mass shootings to know that that is a big problem. For instance, at the Independence Day shooting, it took just minutes for the gunmen to send 83 bullets into the crowd. In the Uvaldi, Texas school shooting, again, we saw children slaughtered at the end of an automatic weapon. So so many people here feel that Biden's new reforms, what he's doing right now is simply not enough. Catherine, I wonder how that trauma, that fear, that anger, the clear frustration, how that's actually impacting on Biden's popularity. We know that the midterm elections are coming up in November. So what are the polls actually telling us about how people are feeling about Biden's leadership? Yeah, well unfortunately for the US president right now, he does seem to have lost the faith of American voters. In fact, a New New York Times poll shows that his approval rating is sitting at just 33%. Perhaps even more worryingly for Biden, right now among Democratic voters, 64% feel that their party should be nominating a new candidate for 2024. In essence, people seem to feel that Biden has failed to meet the moment on a range of topics, not just gun control, but also on things like abortion and climate change. Now having said that, some of those issues really are out of Biden's hands. We know that he actually is an advocate for tighter gun control. He has repeatedly said he agrees that automatic weapons should be banned in the US, that there is absolutely no reason anyone needs to be walking around with an automatic rifle. But time and time again, we've seen Republicans block any of those sorts of reforms in Congress. And when it comes to climate change or reproductive rights, Biden is dealing with a really hostile Supreme Court. And that's really a legacy of the Trump era. So whether or not a new president for the Democratic Party would be any more successful than Biden, that's a big question mark. Yeah, you mentioned Trump. So I wonder whether we can wrap things up there because yesterday we spoke about the investigation into the January 6th Capitol Riot. Yesterday was the seventh hearing and what did we learn, Catherine, what did we learn as a result of yesterday's hearing? Well, it's fair to say that yesterday's hearing was pretty extraordinary. We learned that the former President Trump knew there was no evidence of widespread election fraud and he knew that because some of his closest advisors repeatedly kept telling him that. In fact, many of those advisors urged him to concede the election. We know that he decided not to follow that advice. We also learned about that crucial text message we were talking about yesterday that he sent on December 19, that that message he sent out saying that it was statistically impossible for him to have lost the election to Joe Biden. That did inspire people to gather at Washington, including members of extremist groups. But what is interesting is that despite all those suggestions that Trump's actions and words did help to spark the riot, the committee has not been able to point to a single moment where Trump directly ordered an extremist group into action or even knew precisely what they were doing. And that may be a sticking point as far as whether the Justice Department decides to pursue charges against Trump. Having said that, the Justice Department is already busy because there was an allegation at the end of the hearing yesterday of witness tampering. We heard right near the end that Trump allegedly tried to contact a witness who has yet to give evidence at this investigation. That allegation has now been referred to the Justice Department to investigate. Yeah, more to come on this, Catherine, and no doubt we'll be checking in with you. Again, Catherine Foukin, our US correspondent. Thanks so much, Catherine. Really appreciate your time this morning. Good to see you again. All right, coming up, Phaeaki-Nay, we're told the sky-high fuel prices are down to Russia's war in Ukraine, but Ari fits to strangle Putin's war chest. Really working?

As Russia's war on Ukraine rages on, we've seen the world respond by trying to restrict Vladimir Putin's ability to fund his military, most notably through sanctions on the country's massive oil industry. But is it working? Caitlin McGee takes a look. When Russia rolled into Ukraine, the West wanted to make it pay for its actions, literally, imposed sanctions, cut off its banking system, target oligarchs, and it worked at first. Now the ruble is at its pre-war high and Russia is the biggest oil exporter in the world. So what happened? There are a bunch of reasons why, but the main one is oil. In the first 100 days of the war, Russia earned almost $100 billion in fossil fuel exports. EU nations bought most of that. Even though they're trying to wean themselves off Russian energy, they're still allowing pipeline deliveries. And there are other buyers too. One is China. It's taking more Russian oil than ever. India is also buying up big time. It hasn't always been that way though. In fact, in April, India bought hardly any Russian oil at all. But in May, it started to change. And that matters because there are concerns the Russian oil it's buying is being sent back to Europe in a kind of backdoor arrangement. There's no doubt sanctions have had an effect. And the Russian economy, like a lot of others right now, is facing a recession. But it might not be as deep as some forecasts as expected. So what's the West do to help Ukraine now? That was our wonderful digital colleague, Caitlin McGee, there. You can find more on OneNews.co.n.z. And for further this morning, with insights into how the fossil fuels that continue to flow out of Russia are helping finance Putin's war in Ukraine. We're really pleased to welcome Andre Elas from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air to Breakfast. Good morning, Andre. Thank you so much for joining us. First of all, can you tell us a little bit about the Centre and what it is that you do? Definitely. Thank you very much, Madi, for having me. Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air is a think tank based out of Helsinki that looks at energy and clean air issues around the world in the context, in the wider context of the transition to a cleaner energy system. And since the world in Ukraine, since we are a team of energy analysts based out of Helsinki, Europe and around the world, we've tracked the flow of cash to Putin's regime via tracking the fossil fuels that are exported by Russia. Yeah, and I'm reading your report here financing Putin's war, and it says I'm going to read from it, fossil fuel exports are a key enabler of Russia's military buildup and brutal aggression against Ukraine. What are we talking about here? How crucial are these exports? Well, they are very important to Russia for two reasons, mainly because it finances their budget, up to, on average, half of the budget revenues are coming from the taxes they're imposing on the export of fossil fuels out of Russia, and the other half comes from normal economic activity. And we've seen in the past three months that actually both streams of revenues are declining. Maybe not at the pace that we want to, but they're definitely declining and they're posing a short-term to medium-term problem to Russia's continued aggression against Ukraine. But we can delve into later. Yeah, although the revenue is still sky high at the moment, and we've been talking a lot about sanctions into Russia as well. But like I said, those exports do remain sky high. So why is that? Why are we seeing such high prices? Well, to start with revenues from fossil fuels have picked in March and are on the decline since then. In June, revenues have declined by 18% compared to May. In June, Russia sold 14% less oil compared to Maine. Russia is selling still a lot of oil outside of Russia because it is a big exporter. And you cannot replace overnight a big exporter such as Russia. But what we've seen is these revenues are declining month over month since April. And that's limiting Russia's options going further in this world. And what we're seeing is that budget revenues and budget from other taxes are declining as well. Russia is diminishing the value of its mineral wealth by having its best customer, the European Union, avoiding its fossil fuels. China and India cannot make for a, for, the European Union, avoiding its fossil fuels. China and India cannot make for such a good customer as the European Union. Still, EU buys about 50% of their oil despite of the sanctions, but that will decline as more sanctions are kicked in. Russia is selling oil to China and India at about 30% discount compared to what it would have sold to the European Union. That has a significant effect in their cash revenues. Yeah, and Caitlin, our reporter mentioned it in her piece earlier, Andre, that potentially there's a bit of a backdoor deal being done where some of those fossil fuels are actually still being funneled into Europe via places like India. Definitely, it can happen. I mean, Russia is selling fossil fuels, mostly oil, and that's where the revenues are coming. And oil is highly sought after at high prices currently in a tight market. And there might be there should be some people less scrupulous that are buying refined products made out of Russian crude in India. But overall, it's declining, it's marginal. And the key message that I want to send here is that despite this high sky revenues, month-to-month revenues are declining. And that's the more important story I said. I'd say not necessarily that revenues are high, but they are declining. Budget deficits in Russia are deepening. They will be having a budget deficit of about $60 billion to finance this year, which means that they will burn through around the third of their sovereign wealth to plug in that gap. So sanctions are working. This is the key message that we are transmitted. They're not working like magic from one month to the other, but in month over month, the revenues of the Russian state will decline and are declining because they are losing their best client, which is the European Union. And that cannot be matched easily. Andre, we so appreciate your time this morning. Thank you for your insight and the work that you and the centre do as well. And for coming on breakfast here in New Zealand for us this morning. That's Andre Elas from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Thank you very much, Madi, for having me. Thank you.

Here is your 630 news. With some experts predicting COVID case numbers could hit the same peaks we experienced earlier in the year, free masks and rat tests are expected to be announced by the government today. There were over 11,000 daily COVID cases yesterday, up from 10,000 this time last week. It comes as a new B-5 sub-variant is likely to soon be the dominant strain. One News understands changes around vaccinations will also be announced today. And overseas, a state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka. It comes as mass protests continue over the island's economic crisis with President Gottabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country ahead of his expected resignation. The acting president is relying on the military to restore what he calls normalcy. We cannot allow this fascist political ideology to spread in this country. I have given all the necessary powers to the military to bring stability. Protesters furious at President Rajapaks's departure have declared they will continue protesting until both leaders resign. And CCTV footage detailing how the Uvaldi school shooting unfolded has been released, fueling criticism of the delayed response from law enforcement. The video shows officers approaching the door of the classroom with the gunman inside, then retreating for more than an hour after he opened fire. But the decision to release the footage has enraged victims' families who hadn't seen the video themselves first. They were going to see the video, but they didn't need to see the gunmen coming in and hear the gunshots. They don't need to relive that. They've been through enough, and that was the most chicken way to put this video out today. Whether it was released by the DPS or who it was released for, in my opinion, was very unprofessional, which this investigation has been, in my opinion, since day one. 19 students and two teachers were killed in the shooting at Rob Elementary School. And now to sports news, and order has been restored in state of origin, with Queensland winning a thrilling game three decider. The Maroons opened the scoring through Valentine Homes after a fiery opening 10 minutes in and the second half belonged to Queensland with a dazzling display to run in three tries to humble their interstate rivals. When he's on that side, he's more of a running threat. Very good. Very good. He's a big punch by Dan Hintz. He's bracing away up field. Go, Ben Hunt. He goes of the origin. These are some of the longest away up field. Ben Hunt, he goes for the corner. Bill Hunt wins the origin for Queensland. These are some of the longest grabs I've seen in the sports news story. I look final score, but worth it. 22, 12. It is the maroon's 23rd State of Origin win. And the Silver Ferns, Commonwealth Games preparations are off to a strong start, winning their opening game of the Cadbury series against a New Zealand A side. The second string lineup pushed the Ferns in the first half, only trailing by three goals at half time. But some clinical shooting from Maya Wilson, Grace Inwicka and Bailey Mears helped their side to a runaway victory. Finish out the quarter. The injury was sort of late-ish. How does she do it every single game now? The final score, 6748 to the Ferns. It's getting pretty close, so I'm really proud tonight. I think that was a really good effort from us. We had so many different combos out there as well. I think that shows the depth of our team. But yeah, stoke with that school line, that's really impressive against a really strong NZA side. And the New Zealand men made a winning start to their campaign beating a mixed invitational side 4739. And finally, the rising cost of living is hitting Australians where it hurts most. Their Bunnings Sausages for the first time in 15 years, Bunnings is lifting the prices on its iconic sausage sizzles. From next weekend, Aussies will have to fork out $3.50 for a snag instead of $2.50. While they're a staple for community groups and charities fundraising, there has been a significant downturn in what they're left with, the silver lining. Extra onions are still free. No word on any price increases in Altheiroa yet. And take your look at your weather this morning. We are starting off with some warnings today. Only in the upper north, a heavy rain warning in place from midday in Northland. And this will stick around until early tomorrow morning. Make sure you drive to the conditions and take care out there on the roads. Now to the top of the motu, rain developing this morning with heavier falls pretty much everywhere. Only Auckland in Fittianha you'll be waking up to a cloudy morning and enjoy it while it lasts. There's some heavy falls expected to come. 16 degrees a high there. And heading south, it's a cloudy day here. You'll get possible showers but heavier rainfalls in Tauranga and Fakataane. 13 degrees high all the way in Taupo. Into the east coast, it's a fine day for almost everybody here. It will be a cloudy afternoon, but a sunny morning in Marserton to wake up to 14 degrees is your high. And crossing to the west, cloudy day here as well. This morning, you've got a few showers. That should ease later on in the afternoon with a bit of sun peeping out or trying to, 14 degrees is a high in Wellington. And to the South Island, everybody here is in for a cloudy day today, Westport all the way down to Hockey Teke. Shows for you this morning, but that will clear for you in Greymouth and Hockey Tekechere for a beautiful afternoon, 13 degrees a high for you. And further south it's a cloudy start to the day here but you can expect some fine breaks later on this afternoon. Not too bad, eight degrees a high in Alexandra. And to the deep south it's a wet day so you will definitely want to pack an umbrella or a raincoat, Queenstown all the way down to Rakiota Stewart Island, waking up to showers. Milk of Sound, you're going to have a beautiful day, though. Eight degrees, the high for you. Thanks, Indio. Now, I've been on the show for a while now, five and a half years, and almost five of those years I was doing the weather. But something was pointed out to me this morning about our weather graphics that I have never noticed before. Okay. Are you ready to have your day ruined? Gosh. I'm so sorry to do this to you all. I'm going to get Olly up producer to bring up the graphics. Now you have a look at the 10 and the 16 of Fakitani. What do you notice about that? What should I be noticing that? It's out of alignment with the other number. Why? I don't know. Oh no, now you're pointed at that. Is that for every region? Is the second city out of alignment? No, it's just certain numbers. Push it out. So you'll see the 17 of Gisbon and Napier. Trust Ollie, so observant to notice this. And that out of alignment. And now you are going to be sitting at home watching the weather graphics with your day ruin. The 15 there in New Plymouth. Oh, now that looks awful. Yeah. Doesn't it? Levin. I'm so sorry to do that to you. What is that? Anyway, we can come. Why would you do that, Maddie? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. But it got me thinking because that has driven Oli, our producer, crazy. Crazy. He can't stop thinking about it. You need to get a life. Well, it got me thinking about the small, rather insignificant things that are your pet peeves. Ryan, my partner, loves to have our pillows fluffed on the couch and on the bed. And I will try and appease him by fluffing our pillows when I leave the lounge, you know, at nighttime or whatever. And I will go into our room and then I'll come back out into the lounge and Ryan will have snuck to the couch to refluff the pillows. It's his little, it's his little quirk. Please, Ryan. Hang on, hang on, hang on. How much effort do you actually put into fluffing up those pillows? And have you ever asked him, how can I do this better? Yes. Yes. And still, so it's about him. It's not about you. Yes. It's something here. Very much about him. Okay, cool. Yeah. So I want to know from you, what are the things, the little insignificant things that grind your gears? We don't have time for the list of things that I have. But one thing can I just mention is when you go into the Ferepaku, to the toilet, and the empty toilet roll, the cardboard, is on the actual thingy. And the toilet roll, the new one is on top thingy. The toilet roll, the new one, is on top. No one's bothered to take the... It takes two seconds. Oh, that does remind me of what my pet peeve is. Is the toilet paper hanging on the wrong side? Oh, no! That does get me. I always flip it and I'm always annoyed. So are you under or an over? Isn't over the way, though? That is the correct way. For most people, yeah. But I don't know how many times I have to tell everyone in my household, but it's always... Stop telling them. Just get used to it because that's the only way that you're going to get any stress relief. I'm about to put toilet paper in people's lunchboxes. Like, one day I will because it does annoy me.

No, my hokey mine, or welcome back to where it hurts them. A raft of new law changes has been announced. They target guns, vehicles and cash with tougher penalties to be imposed on gang activity. Drive-by shootings will carry a harsh penalty with a new offence created carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison for discharging a gun with intent to intimidate. Think about drive-by shootings. Police will also get more powers to search gang members' property during a time of gang conflict. Motorbikes and cars will be able to be impounded for a wider range of offences to help police tackle convoys. There's also a new power to seize cash up to $10,000 when found in suspicious circumstances. And rules around the trade of high-end luxury items like boats and jewellery will be tightened prohibiting cash sales. We connected in with the honorary member of the mongrel mob, Harry Tam, who told us the government could also be targeting other areas. One area where there has been no focus on, and that is supporting gang mediation efforts by people like myself who've had a long track record of mediating gang disputes, particularly ones that involve homicides and getting extremely good outcomes out of it. I struggle to get support to do, to instigate some mediation efforts. Harry Tamne, we're grateful to welcome back to the program, sociologist, author and gang expert Dr Jared Gilbert to share his views on all of this this morning. Moranaguer, Jared, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Two things. I guess I want you to respond to what Harry had to say in terms of the other area that the government could be looking at and perhaps is already looking at, but also your reaction to those announcements yesterday. There's always more that can be done. And I'm actually, I was really heartened, in fact, that don't get me wrong, this is a political response to a political problem and to some degree that the government had been forced to act on this. But they've actually managed to stay fairly true to themselves in the sense that they haven't responded with deeply political measures that they've just put in some hail merries that may be about chasing votes rather than effective policy or legislation. Now with regard to Harry's point, we have actually had that in the past in the 1980s. There were actually schemes in place or there was a service set in place, that did actually help to mediate gang disputes. And what we saw, in fact, in the gang war between the tribesmen and the killer bees recently, which really sparked community concern, quite rightly, I might say, those activities were dangerous, completely out of line, something needed to be done. But they were actually quashed by existing police powers, good, solid on-the-ground policing, and mediation between the groups. So we sometimes go for fancy laws because they sound great when actually the existing powers and provisions done well is usually what solves the problem. It was interesting because I think Minister Kiritapu Allen yesterday and Chris Hipkins both stressed that whilst they announced these suite of legislation changes, that there is actually other things going on behind closed doors, so to speak, that it isn't out in the public, that isn't out in the media, that is looking at the reasons as to why people join gangs and then looking at that route of that problem, right? Yeah, look, and to be honest, that was one of the things that heartened me the most. In fact, it was only about two months ago that I released a big report looking at the last wave of gang legislation we've introduced, and part of that I said was that we should be deeply suspicious of politicians who say, here's the answer, we've just got to pass this law or these laws, and we will solve the issue. Because what we've seen in the past is it's invariably rubbish without question. And so to put these measures, which I know, I know stretch gangbusting measures, whatever that may be. In fact, I don't think gangbusting measures actually exist in the sense that you can just produce something and it all solves the problem. But what they did do is say, look, these are tools that will be important in the toolkit to assist some of the prettier issues that we're dealing with and they are difficult issues. But we've got to accept that a law and order response is only part of this equation, that unless we address the drivers of gang membership and indeed of crime, the same things that drive gang membership are the same things that fill our prisons, of course. Unless we look to tackle that, then we won't get to the root of the problems. And even just acknowledging that shows that there's a degree of thinking here that I think, oh, I've got to tip my hat to. I said it's important, and I'm seeing it. Now, whether or not anything comes to pass, well, that's another question. Yeah. There's two questions that I want to finish this interview with, Jared. And one of them is, what out of those announcements that came out yesterday do you think could potentially have a big impact when it comes to gang violence? And I know that the devil is in the detail, right? But if we can look at what was announced yesterday, what in there do you believe could be impactful? I think four of the five provisions have at least have the possibility of being quite useful. I think the changes around using cash, large cash purchases or carrying cash, I think that's really quite well targeted because it's only going to impact on those that have got nefarious reasons for carrying that type of cash. If a legitimate business has got reason to carry that cash, and they will be able to prove that very, very quickly. So that's, you know, those are tidy enough examples. The one where I think we've got to have a very close look. And as you say, the devil is in the detail without question, is around the warrants. Over 14 days, you know, when we give police significant powers, we should, we must be very, very careful when we're doing that because those are really intrusive powers. And it's easy to say, well, it's just at the gangs. Well, once these are in, they're often used in a variety of ways so we have to be very careful there so that's one we want to look at but even there in the in the small amount of detail that we know they've given us fairly tight they're fairly restricted in what they're attempting to do they're over a short period of time so even there we can see that there is a level of restraint. So, you know, good start. Yeah, just finally, and I've got about 30 seconds, Jared. Yesterday, National responded, Christopher Luxon, saying that these measures, they're not tough enough. They keep going back to banning gang, back to stopping gang members gathering in public, stopping them associating with one another, and, of course, stopping gang members gathering in public, stopping them associating with one another, and of course stopping gang members accessing guns. Do we need to go down that track? Does actually banning patches make a difference? Look, banning patches will make a difference. It will have an impact. There's no question there at all. There are two components to that. The first is does it tackle the problems at play? So internationally, street gangs don't wear backpatchers, but we see the same concerns that we see overseas. So it masks it and it may move it underground. Police officers said when they were banned in Wanganui very briefly, because of Bill of Rights issues, it was overturned, but when it banned very briefly, he said, look, issues, it was overturned, but when it banned very briefly, said, look, patches allow the police to gather intel, they allow the public to make decisions around their behaviour. And so there's that component of it. I think it's sort of politics over policy, if I'm perfectly honest, on one hand. But on the other hand, you know, we do have universal rights of freedom of expression. Is the payoff, is what is the gain we're going to get for chipping away at universal rights? And people will say game members don't have rights. Well, it's not how universal rights work. We should be very mindful of those on the difficult issues because we never challenge about them on the easy ones. And so that needs to be considered as well, I would I. Yeah, gosh, there's so much more to discuss. Jared, you're always a brilliant guest for us. Thank you so much for your time this morning and your insights and expertise.

We're getting some fantastic feedback about your pet peeves, which we'll get to a little bit later on. But right now, it is two minutes to seven. Heading to the West Coast now and the Department of Conservation have been running what's called a Jobs for Nature program. Overall, this program has clocked up more than 70,000 hours of conservation work and has given employment opportunities to many coastal communities. Our Christchurch reported Digby, Worthmuller, has headed out to the coast to check out the Pungungaero Bullock Creek Restoration Project and Puna Kaiki. Morning, guys, that's right. We're in Poonikaiki, which is a remote, small coastal community just north of Greymouth. And I'm joined by Juliette Curry who's the national manager for the Volunteers Conservation Group and they've been doing some pretty awesome work out in this neck of the woods tell me a little bit about Jobs for Nature which is obviously a dock funding program and what that's meant for this community well yeah Jobs for Nature is a COVID relief package put together by the government to help hard-hit areas. So areas that relied heavily on tourism previously to help create jobs in the nature space to kind of, yeah, hopefully fill some of the void left by tourists. Because obviously the international borders have been closed and you were telling me before a lot of those people that come from overseas get stuck into the kind of work because it's so cool on the coast to do that. But now that they are not here, you haven't had anyone to be able to do that. Yeah, that's right. We're conservation volunteers, so that's what we did. We project-managed conservation projects using international labour to put the trees in the ground. But obviously that all dried up. So jobs for nature helped us continue to do the trees in the ground. But obviously that all sort of dried up. So jobs for nature helped us continue to do the great work that we do and also create jobs for local people. It's 17 jobs, isn't it? 17 jobs. And that may not seem like a lot if you're from a big city like myself, but rural communities, 17 jobs is a lot of jobs. Yeah, the ripple throughout the community for something like that's huge. Yeah, for sure. No, that's awesome. All right, well, we're going to get stuck in and actually do a little bit of potting because I didn't come all this way to just talk. So get my hands dirty. And why these plants, Julia, what's so important about this specific plant? So this one here is a type of hebe, people might recognise. It's Kodomiko, botanical name Veronica Silicifolia, which you will be quizzed on later. Yeah, so this is one of the species that occurs naturally in the Bullet Creek area. Bullet Creek's a special unique landform, it's one of the only, it's the only land form of its kind in the country. Yeah. And yeah, so this is one of the species that exists naturally up there. Our team go up there. They collect all the seed and all the vegetative material. We bring it back here to the nursery, grow it, and then our tree planning crew goes and puts them in the ground. So over the course of the funded period, it will be about over 300,000 plants will go I see, I see. I come through here and head back up. I grew up on a farm and whenever my parents would get me doing gardening work or potting work, I hated it. I just couldn't stand it. But I don't mind it today. I don't mind it today. Knowing a bit more about it. But we're also joined by Brian and Sharon, who we're going to be catching up with Sharon a little bit later on because there's a species of bird, which its only breeding colony in the world is here in Punecaiki, and every morning at around 720 they fly out. So we're going to try catch that, but we'll catch up with her a little bit later on about those birds, which her uncle's actually discovered. So stick around. A lot more cool things to come. Thanks very much, Digby. At the Maria here is your 7 o'clock news. As COVID numbers continue to climb, free masks and rat tests are expected to be announced by the government today. There were over 11,000 daily COVID cases yesterday, up from 10,000 this time last week. It comes as a new B5 sub-variant is likely to soon be the dominant strain. Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker says everyone is at high risk at the moment because the virus is so present in the community. We could easily see a peak of Omicron infections to rival the peak we saw earlier this year. I mean, we're already seeing case numbers track up, but I think it's very concerning we're seeing so many people in hospital, and we're seeing heading up towards 20 people a day dying from this infection. One News understands changes around vaccinations will also be announced today. And new government legislation tackling gang crime is a heartening step forward, according to sociologist Dr Jared Gilbert, but also a political move. The changes include harsher penalties for gun crimes and a stop to cash purchases of high-end goods. With more than 20 drive-by shootings in just two weeks, Dr Gilbert says what needs to be for gun crimes and a stop to cash purchases of high-end goods. With more than 20 drive-by shootings in just two weeks, Dr Gilbert says what needs to be addressed is the drivers of gang membership. They did do is say, look, these are tools that will be important in the toolkit to assist some of the pritrier issues that we're dealing with, and they are difficult issues. But we've got to accept that a law and order response is only part of this equation. Also speaking to breakfast, gang expert Harry Tam, said the government needs to focus on solving gang disputes. And a state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka. It comes as mass protests continue over the island's economic crisis, with President Gatabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country ahead of his expected resignation. The acting president is relying on the military to restore what he calls normalcy. And in sport, and Billy Slater has once again tasted state-of- of Origin success with his first winning as coach of the Maroons as his side outclassed New South Wales Blues in game three of the series. The Maroons opened the scoring through Valentine Holmes after a fiery opening 10 minutes. The second half belonged to Queensland with a dazzling display to run in three tries to humble their interstate rivals. When he's on that side, he's more of a running track. By good. He's been playing. He goes to the way up field. Go! Ben Hunt, he goes to the corner. Bill Hunt wins the origin for Queensland. Mean final score, 2212. It is the Maroon's 23rd State of Origin win. I don't know if I felt any more proud other than my children being born than I do right now. And what an effort that was. That was an incredible game, unique game for the start. You know, they're chanting your name. Billy Slater, these were the scenes in the Queensland dressing room afterwards. Maroon's winger, Kaelin Ponger, was named Man of the Match, while forward Patrick Carrigan was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as player of the series. I'd like to make a complaint. Okay, file your complaint to HR, Jamie, for the head of news. Taking a look at your weather this morning, starting off with a warning. A heavy rain warning in place from midday in Northland. This will stick around until early tomorrow morning. So take care out there on the roads. And to the top of the country, rain developing this morning. Heavy falls expected pretty much all day for almost everybody. Fitianga, your high will be 16 degrees for a cloudy morning. And heading south, it's cloudy here with possible showers as well. You've got rain developing later on today and some heavy falls there in Tauranga and Fakataane. 14 degrees, the high in Tokoroa today. To the east coast, it's a fine day for most of you, but later on this afternoon you will get that cloud starting to come about and some rain there in Gisbon, but Marston, enjoy the lovely sunny morning while you have it, 14 degrees is your high. In crossing to the west, it's a cloudy day here, you've got a few morning showers as well. Those will develop into a little bit more rain for you, Tomeranoi, by the afternoon. 15 degrees as a high in Levin. Into the South Island, you're all in for a cloudy day here. Westport to Hokitika, you will also get showers this morning. But that will clear for a pretty good afternoon. 13 degrees are high from Westport all the way down to Hokitka. In further south, a cloudy start to the day as well. You can expect some fine breaks later on in the afternoon, but it's pretty good. Eight degrees are high in Alexandra. Into the deep south, it's a wet day. Sh showers for most of you with fine breaks expected pretty much after lunchtime. But Milford Sound, you're going to have a gorgeous day. Enjoy a walk in the park or wherever you want to go. Eight degrees is your high. And it is beautiful down there. And it is now eight minutes past seven. As COVID becomes our new norm, there's mixed views on how we should be handling it here in New Zealand and around the world. So if you have switched off, we don't blame you, but here is a refresher on where we are at. The pandemic has been hard for many people in many ways, and we're all fatigued, right? But while reporting has dropped off, COVID hasn't. Since the pandemic, nearly one and a half million people have been confirmed with the virus, although the true number could be considerably higher due to people not reporting their own tests online. Our daily cases remain high with almost 11.5,000 cases yesterday. At the moment, the Canterbury and West Coast regions have the highest case numbers in Alteodola. And the age group most affected are those in their 20s, with those in their 30s, not far behind. But it's the older age bracket worse off with COVID. We've had 1,645 deaths among people with the virus in New Zealand, of which the vast majority were 60 or older. So how's New Zealand looking compared to the rest of the world? We've been touting our response throughout the pandemic, but stats from Johns Hopkins University, collated by our world in data, shows New Zealand has the most confirmed cases per million people in the world. Important to note, though, other countries may not be testing as much. But national leader Christopher Luxon has been jet-setting around Singapore, Ireland and the UK and says people across the globe are not worried about COVID anymore. Yeah, what was interesting to me was, you know, people are moving on in these other countries as well. And I think, you know, there was no conversations really around COVID. In places like Ireland, there's no masking anywhere inside or outside. And really, people are just focused on how they rebuild their economies and their societies. However, the World Health Organization's boss, Tedros Adonom, is urging governments to take steps to curb COVID transmission amid fresh waves of cases. I urge governments to regularly review and adjust their COVID-19 response plans based on the current epidemiology and also the potential for new variants to appear. New waves of the virus demonstrate again that the COVID-19 is nowhere near over. As the virus pushes at us, we must push back. While we may want it to be over, the pandemic continues to simmer away. Joining us now to help make sense of what all of this means is Dr Brian Betty, Medical Director of Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners. Morrida, Dr Betty, thank you so much for being with us this morning. How are you? Oh, morning, Matt. It's lovely to be here. Yeah, it's nice to have you with us. Are you concerned by the significant rise in cases that we're seeing at the moment around the country? I think it is a concern in the sense that one of the things the figures don't tell us at the moment is what we are seeing is a move into those older age groups with this BA5 variant. Now, it's a bit paradoxical because we actually protected the older population very well early on in COVID in New Zealand. However, with the rejection of mask use, winter with us being indoors, perhaps us listening, it started to move into the older age groups where we tend to see our most vulnerable in our population affected with hospitalisations and death. So that is a real concern on top of the pressures that we've got in the hospitals and health system at this point. Yeah, and it's pretty clear we don't actually even have the full picture, right, because of what we mentioned in that piece about people not necessarily actually recording their tests or getting tested in the first place? Look, I think that's a really important point. I mean, we know we've got about a million and a half confirmed cases, and we have been very good at doing this. However, there's a lot of people who may not be testing, may not be aware that they've had COVID, so the case rate is probably a lot higher, maybe about half the population have been exposed to COVID. And I think the other important point here is what we are actually seeing, the majority of those that are now getting affected with COVID are those that haven't had exposure to COVID in the past. So although immunisation is very important, we know that natural immunity probably has quite a role to play here. We mentioned those high case numbers, the highest case numbers per million in the world at the moment in Altaeroa. Why is that? Why would we be seeing that significantly here in New Zealand? Look, I think it's because we've actually been very, very good at testing. I think we've been a superb at the amount of rat testing and reporting that's going on. So we've got, I think, a much higher reporting rate than many other countries in the world. So a lot of countries aren't testing now. A lot of people don't test, whereas New Zealand still is testing, and we are reporting those cases, and it does give us this higher rate. So it's totally dependent on what's happening in individual countries and how much testing is actually going on. We spoke to both the Prime Minister and Christopher Luxon about COVID this week. Two pretty different responses to be honest. You heard Christopher Luxon, the national leaders there talking about the fact that around the world no one's really talking about COVID anymore and just kind of moving on, getting on with it. The Prime Minister is saying it's still a very real concern for her. Who's right? Is there a right answer? Or is it a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B? Look, I think this is a very difficult situation. I think what we're tapping into here, people are fatigued. They want to move on from COVID. They want to get past it. Unfortunately, COVID's still with us. And New Zealand's in the situation of being in the middle of winter when it is spreading on top of an already sort of very pressured health system. So we've got a real concern that if these numbers continue to rise, that it puts additional pressure on the health system and it really, really puts strain on what's going on. So, yeah, it's two sides of the equation, the impulse to say let's just move on versus the reality of the pressures that's actually on the health system at this point. And we do need to make sure we've got some protection in place to make sure that we function for the rest of winter. Yeah, and as you say, it's easy for some people to say, let's move on if they've had COVID and had a reasonably mild experience with it. But there's a lot of vulnerable communities, as you mentioned, for whom this is a really serious concern. In particular, the elderly, the over-60, over-70s, where we know the hospital admission rates are higher we know the death rates are significantly higher and this is the group that hasn't had much exposure in the first six months of this year to COVID because we have actually protected our vulnerable communities very well so yeah this is a concern matt, that this is potentially happening and we are starting to see higher rates in that older age group. And one of the other concerning things is the fact that as our death rate continues to rise, a lot of those fatalities are people that have actually been boosted, 61%. What does that tell us? That sounds concerning to me. Look, I think if you start to look at the overall figures, we've been very successful with our immunisation. So we've had over five million of the New Zealand population immunised. So immunisation is not 100% effective. And that's the thing we need to understand about it. So there is still breakthrough. People can still get it. So we still see hospital admissions with people who are immunized and people dying who are immunized. However, and this is the really, really important point. If less of our population were immunized, more people would be in hospital, more people would be dying. It's relative. So it gives us protection. It's not 100% but certainly it is the best, best defence we have against COVID. So as that fatigue grows, Dr. Betty, and it is certainly growing. What would you like to say to people this morning? What would you like them to know? Look, it's understandable people are fatigued. It's understandable that people want to move on. However, I think there are a couple of things that are really, really important here. Number one, immunisation is still our number one protection against COVID. So if you haven't been boosted, go and get boosted. Secondly, look, mask wearing voluntarily in indoor spaces is still a very good thing. It slows the spread of COVID. And thirdly, if you are sick with maybe a cold or a flu or any of those symptoms, stay at home. Don't spread it. So those three things, I think, are fundamentally important to what we're doing, and we should try and keep a focus on those. As much as we'd love to think we're out of the woods, we've got a long way to go yet. Dr Brian Betty, we really appreciate your time this morning from the Royal New Zealand College of GPs.

Calls are growing, though, for New Zealand to pull out, but with tensions rising in the region, some experts want more investment. One news reporter Sam Calway is in Honolulu now and joins us now. Mordina, Sammy, we'd so love having you on this show. Thank you so much. Look beautiful in Honolulu this morning. Hey, can you just tell us quickly? Tell you what it's stunning. This, um, you go, sorry. No, sorry, but a little bit of a delay, Sammy, but we'll work through it. Can you just tell us quickly what it's stunning? You go, sorry. No, sorry. A little bit of a delay, Sammy, but we'll work through it. Can you just tell us a little bit about what it is that RIMPack is hoping, wants to try and achieve? Yeah, well, look, it's 26 nations, Maddie, that come together. There's 38 ships out here, and it's all about being adaptive partners. It's basically everyone coming together, working within the Pacific as a joint enterprise. So today and the last couple of days we've seen ships out there, we've seen numbers of different countries. And actually I was at the Marine Corps base yesterday's on the northern part of the island. And it was really fascinating, Maddie, because there were so many different people from different countries and everyone was getting on really well. I bumped into a couple of Australians. They were always a pretty good time over here. They're pulled in some Tongans who they're working with. So I guess that's kind of the mentality that RIMPAC's trying to achieve. It's that unity to work in the Pacific, and there's not a more important time to do that. Yeah, absolutely. Although, as like so many things these days, our New Zealand force has been hit by COVID. Yeah, Madi, such a shame. I was supposed to be on the HMNZS, Al-Teroa on Monday. We're supposed to set sail for the Pacific, but unfortunately we had 12 cases of COVID on board. The commander said that they're mild symptoms and most are asymptomatic, but he said it has delayed sailing. They're hopeful they may be able to get out into the Pacific today or Thursday. That's Hawaiian time. At the moment, though, he said the health and well-being of the crew is just so important. So they're still in port, hopeful to get away. And of course, the HMNZS-Otero plays a really important role. It supplies fuel such as diesel and avgas and they're also doing some scientific research out in the pacific i asked about that but they couldn't tell me they said i wasn't allowed to shoot the containers at the front of the HMNZS altero but no doubt we'll hear a bit about that in the coming months yes there's some really important work being done there but there are some concerns sam about whether we should actually be there at all. Yeah, so you've got one side of the argument saying that we need to invest more heavily in the Pacific. We need to bolster our marine, our maritime, sorry, exercises and our operations. You know, people saying we can't solely rely on the US. They're facing their own domestic issues and they may not be able to act internationally in the way that we'd like them to see. So it's about working potentially more with Australia, European countries, some Scandinavian countries. But then on the flip side of that, I spoke to a woman who grew up in Hawaii, who now lives in Auckland and she says she has major concerns for the indigenous people here in Hawaii and the environmental impact that impact has. She reckons New Zealand should make people here in Hawaii and the environmental impact that RIMPAC has. She reckons New Zealand should make a really strong stance and pull out of RIMPAC altogether. Maddie, in the current climate, I just can't see that happening at the moment. No. Have you put any of that to the New Zealand force? Have they made any comments about their involvement in RIMPAC? Oh, I haven't had a chance to put that to them just yet. I spoke to that woman last night, so I will talk to NSDF today and get their stance on that. Even driving into Pearl Harbor, Maddie, so I'm sort of in the memorial zone of Pearl Harbor at the moment, and there's usually battleships around me. There's obviously the Arizona, which you can't quite see the memorial, the living memorial to the Arizona there. But, yeah, we will put some of that to the Defence Force and see what they say. Sam, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Really appreciate your work and hopefully having some downtime to have a couple of my tiths or something like that on the island. I'll have one for you, Maddie MacLlay. I'll have one for you, my friend. Thank you so much. That's Sam Cowelley, our excellent one news reporter, joining us from Honolulu this morning.

Today's breakfast brewer is Dilma Earl Grey, strong yet fragrant and infused with Bergamot. I've been dreaming about the whisked by some faces that I don't know. Nisangra, here is your 730 news. Al-Therro's soaring COVID numbers are the highest in the world. The latest global numbers has New Zealand with the most confirmed cases per million people. And more than 11,000 COVID cases were reported yesterday. That's up from around 10,000 last week. Dr Brian Betty of the College of GP says, while many people want to move on, there needs to be protection for the health system during winter. We've got a real concern that if these numbers continue to rise, that it puts additional pressure on the health system and it really, really puts strain on what's going on. So yeah, it's two sides of the equation, the impulse to say let's just move on, versus the reality of the pressures that's actually on the health system at this point. The government is expected to announce free masks and rat tests today and changes around vaccinations. A state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka. It comes as mass protests continue over the island's economic crisis, with President Gatabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country ahead of his expected resignation. The acting president is relying on the military to restore what he calls normalcy. And in sports news, the Silver Ferns Commonwealth Games preparations are off to a strong start winning their opening game of the Cadbury series against New Zealand A side. The second string lineup pushed the Ferns in the first half, only trailing by three goals at half time. But some clinical shooting from Maya Wilson, Grayson Wicke and Bailey Mears helped their side to a runaway victory. Finish out the quarter. The injury was sort of late-ish. How does she do it every single game now? The final score is 67-48 to the ferns. It's getting pretty close, so I'm really proud tonight. I think that was a really good effort from us. We had so many different combos out there as well. I think that shows the depth of our team. But yeah, stoked with that scoreline, that's really impressive against a really strong NZA side. And the New Zealand men made a winning start to their campaign, beating a mixed invitational side 4739. Go the boroughs. And Queensland have claimed yet another state of origin series, edging New South Wales, and a thrilling decider in Brisbane overnight. The maroons opened the scoring through Valentine Holmes after a fiery opening 10 minutes, and the second half belonged to Queensland with a dazzling display to run in three tries to humble their interstate rivals. When he's on that side, he's more of a running threat. Very good. Very good. Oh, good. He's been punched by Ben Hunt. Go! Go! Ben Hunt, he goes to the corner! Go! Final score Final score 2212, it's the third state of origin of origin win. And finally if you're struggling with flight delays and travel arrangements, these school holidays, spare a thought for this American family. Sam Torsig, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, was enjoying a break on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent when he discovered American airlines had changed his family's flight home without his knowledge, departing from a different country, St. Lucia. On top of that, the airline said it would charge them to fix the situation. It will have to split up part of your family and put you on a, most of you on a flight a week later, if not longer. And to do that, we're going to charge you change fees, reissuing fees, certain other fees, which were not clear to me, and new fares, which totaled almost about $30,000 to get all of us back. Wow, the family eventually chartered a plane to a third country to connect with their flight home and complaints against airlines right now are up 300% apparently compared to pre-pandemic levels. Crazy. Imagine splitting your family up in another country. Let's take a look at your weather this morning. We are starting off with a heavy rain warning in place from midday in Northland and that will pretty much stick around until early tomorrow morning. So take care out there on the roads. Make sure you drive to the conditions. Now staying in the upper north, we've will pretty much stick around until early tomorrow morning. So take care out there on the roads. Make sure you drive to the conditions. Now staying in the upper north, we've got pretty much just a rainy day and heavy falls. Pretty much all day. That's what you can expect. Light winds for all of you through here. 16s and 15s are your highs. And heading south, it is cloudy with possible showers this morning. You've got rain developing later on today with some heavy falls and 13 degrees, the high in Taupo. And to the east coast, it's a pretty fine day for most of you. You can become, it might get a bit cloudy later on this afternoon. And you can expect some rain if you are in Gisbon later on as well. But Masterton, enjoy your sunny morning while it lasts. Across to the west now. Cloudy with a few morning showers today, but those showers will ease later on for just a cloudy afternoon for my studio. 15 degrees a high in Levin. And to the South Island. Everybody here is in for a cloudy day, pretty much. Blenham, you're going to have a beautiful morning and Grandmother and Hockey Ticker once those showers clear. It's going to be a lovely afternoon, 13 degrees high for you. And further south, a cloudy start to the day here. You can expect some fine breaks later on in the afternoon. Eight degrees the high in Alexandra. And to the deep south, Milford Sound has had a pretty good week, even though everybody else has had lots of rain, heavy falls. Milford Sound's pretty much been untouched, and today it's even more gorgeous. Sun out everywhere, 8 degrees is your high. 8 degrees are high, actually, for everybody here, but everyone else is getting rain from Queenstown to Rakiya to Stuart Island. Suns out, guns out, Milford Sound. Yes. Suns out, guns out. But you're probably going to have a cardigan and pad to cows. It's still 8 degrees. A scarf on with a beanie. Sunny. Hey, thank you for your feedback. Earlier in the show, I mentioned that our weather graphics have a bit of an alignment issue with some of the temperatures. So they don't quite align with each other and it's driving our producer ollie crazy it's a big pet peeve and we wanted to know what your pet peeves are as well what are the things that the kind of insignificant things that drive you wild wendy for example says when i make white sauce I dig a spoon into the butter drives my hubby nuts. The butter must stay straight. He cannot understand why I don't cut it to keep it nice and straight. Yeah, I'm with your hubby on that one. Just fucking loose. Yeah, my husband doesn't like that either. I just kind of dig in there, but do you cook much? It's a thing. Yeah, all the time. I am the cook in our household. Oh my goodness. Just grab a spoon. Kusla. I am so with you. That's so true. When somebody leaves a mouthful of milk in the milk container and then puts it back in the fridge. That is it. That is annoying. Jackie. Jackie, her husband, loves to repack the dishwasher. She says, I've said to him, if you want to make a PhD out of packing the dishwasher, knock yourself out. Some people do have very specific ways they want things done. Yes. And it freaks them out if it's not done the way that they want it to be. I had to have a conversation with my husband one day because I'd cleaned, well, had I cleaned the windows? Yeah, I'd clean the windows. And, you know, I take great pride in that because I don't do it that often. So when I do, I'm like, oh, look at my work. And then the kids were outside and they were putting their fingers on the windows. And my husband's laughing. And they were going, fingers on the windows and my husband's laughing and they were going oh look at mama she's freaking out stressing out and I actually had to have a conversation with him and go we don't laugh about things like that I'm just telling you that actually that hurt so we're clear if you don't want a hiding dean they'll laugh about that pain peeave, though. Cleaning the windows, cleaning any surface in the house, and somebody goes and put something on it. It's like, I just cleaned it. Us now. Greg, our news producer says, I always have to repate the dishwasher because my family are anarchist. I agree, Greg. It's like Tetris. Everything can fit together perfectly. And you don't want to waste space. It's being resourceful, I think. Hey, we'll keep your feedback back coming in with loving getting at breakfast at tvnZ.com. But I wanted to finish with this to change tack, and it's actually leading into your political panel coming up next. There's this kind of general sentiment about potentially COVID fatigue. And whether or not we should just be moving on. Christopher Luxon came on the show on Wednesday and said people aren't talking about it overseas. But Al says this. I know many, many people are over it and I get it. I'm a senior citizen though and I cannot afford to get over it. It's not easy getting over the fact I may die because of the lack of concern from a COVID-fatigued younger generation. But consider this. New Zealand's death and infection rates continue to rise, in fact, one of the highest in the world. And you think it's okay to let us bear the burden of your I'm over it attitude. That's really strong. And he has a point He has an absolute point It's a hard balancing act You know we're opening up to the rest of the world It's been two and a half long long years But for people like Al They are genuinely concerned That us getting on with it And opening up to the rest of the world Could have a detrimental impact on them. The stats are telling us that it was a good reminder actually because I got my mum up with me from Piyo Piyo with me for the last couple of days. And there's a genuine fear there for my mum as a kumatua. Over 1,600 deaths and over 1,400 of them are 60 years and over. And maybe COVID is removed from many of us, but it's a heart reality for a lot of us, including myself, I have had relatives who were in the 60s and 70s, who we knew would have had decades left with us had it not been for COVID. So it's a reality for a lot of people, even though there is COVID fatigue. Yep. We're not out of the woods. No. We're not out of the woods. All right. Coming up after the break, it's the blue versus reds. And we're not talking about state of origin. We're talking about politics. That coming up next. Sometimes all I think about is you. Late nights in the middle of June. I should be staying. Living the highlight. Oh, look at this. Isn't to everyone's taste. I don't like it at all. There's too much poshness. I definitely think I prefer my sausage sandwich. Rich House, Poor House, tonight on one and on TVNZ Plus. Get more snug than a bug in a run. And have a good night with contact.

Now it's time for our fortnightly political panel. Gosh, it was two weeks ago. Yeah. Fortnightly political panel with Shane Tepo wearing his metaphorical red trunks. Oh, with True Blue National. We don't want that. Shut that down. We're true Blue National Party loyalist, Matthew Hilton. Morena, you too? We've got plenty to discuss this morning. Can we start with yesterday's announcement by ministers Chris Hickens and Kiritapu Allen around how they're going to the government is going to tackle gangs? We know that this has been a bit of a political football and we know that National and Christopher Loxon have said we're not being tough enough. Was yesterday's announcement enough to kind of quell those calls for the government to be tougher? Well, I have a different perspective. But look, they're able to take the bling, give the cops more search ability, some important technical space around suppression of using guns. But hey, let's look at the systemic and the real issues. Why gangs are thriving? Because there's a void. It's about systemic and generational poverty. They exist in the Otara and the Mangareas and the Papakura for that very reason. And unless we address those issues, gangs are only going to increase in numbers. It's just the reality. And Justice Minister, Kiddhisapu Allen, did kind of canvass that and say that there are other things that this government is doing, looking at those issues in particular. What did you make of yesterday's announcement? Well, they've had a problem with crime. I guess after they were discovered funding the mongrel mob, that didn't help them much. The gangs took advantage of the gun buyback scheme and got in there before the government did to arm themselves. You've got the 501 issue. You've got the mental health issues associated with COVID that's helped ram raids and things like that. And the previous police minister was seen as not tough on crime. She had a more sophisticated view of policing than that. And the previous police minister was seen as not tough on crime. She had a more sophisticated view of policing than that. And so the two parties are competing, and we've seen Labor's thing today. The problem is that they can't really win. We saw this between national and Labor about 10 or 15 years ago when they competed for who would want the longer sentences, and I guess we'll see something like that occur over the next 18 months. Shane, do you think it's fair to say that the government was funding? Well, it's not true. The Mangrel Mall? No, it's not true. There was an entity with Harry Tam, who's an older chap who used to be involved in the Mongrelma, but led by a clinician that was running an addiction program out of the Marai in Hedatonga that was very successful. And that's the other issue about why gangs exist in this environment. Methamphetamine is highly addictive. That's what underpins these gangs. And as long as we treat this addictive issue as a criminal issue rather than looking through health lens, our chickens are going to continue to come home to roost. Talk to the people in Autara, talk to the people in Papakura. They're not saying the solution lies and they're affected. It's not folks that live in Mount Eden and Epson like I do. Talk to them. They're saying the answer is not over-pleasing. The answer is looking at the systemic issues and giving the communities the ability and the resources to sort themselves out systemic issues and giving the communities the ability and the resources to sort themselves out. These are very resilient communities that have been through this before and they will fix it. One of the problems for a government that's been in for five years is if the things announced yesterday were good ideas, then why is it taken five years for them to happen? And if they weren't good ideas five years ago, are they just a political stunt in reaction to public perception? I mean, eventually all governments reach that point. The British Conservatives have to explain when they do anything new why they didn't do it 12 years ago. But it's no longer good enough for the government to blame the previous government. They've been in office for five years. If this crackdown was a good thing, it should be five years old. I guess one of the positive things that came out of that were announcement yesterday, and I say positive for the government, is that the New Zealand Police Association came out and said it's a solid start. Obviously, there are other things that they want implemented, but have said that it's a solid start. Can we move on to the leadership of Christopher Luxon, six months since he's been in the top job? How do you reckon he's going? I'll start with you, Matthew. Well, he's attracted about 450,000 voters. People who voted for Jacinda Adirn now say they'll vote for Nationals. So that's nearly, what, 20% of the voting base. So you've got to say that's a success. He has managed, National hasn't had too many public meltdowns. Simon Bridges left was the only sort of evidence of division that they've had since he was the leader. And he has managed to keep to his message cost of living crisis, gang crisis and I guess emerging as the health crisis. And he knows about message discipline like leaders of the opposition have to. Another message is around education, which was part of his trip overseas. And we'll get to that shortly. But Shane, in terms of his report card after some of us? No, you'd have to give him a B, maybe a B plus. Look, the reality is how steady the ships. You are right. The polls are trending in terms of national in the right direction. It might have slowed up a little bit over the last month or two. And the adults were in charge. And they certainly weren't under Collins and under Muller and, you know, that whole mess. But the reality is that I think the honeymoon will start to come to an end. The media will be starting, start to ask the big questions. You know, he wants to give himself, and people like me and Matthew, a huge payback in terms of taxes. But what we need to know is where we what gaps will it occur as a result of a result sorry as a result of the massive tax cuts so you know he's had the honeymoon period but the questions now are going to be tougher we're used to hearing the saying that being the opposition leader is the toughest job in politics is it and should we still continue to be calling that well it's a miserable job and you have some of the responsibilities that a Prime Minister has over their party. But you haven't won an election or worse, you've just lost one. So you don't have the manner that a Prime Minister has to maintain discipline. So, yeah, it's pretty hard to keep all those, you know, diverse themes, streams within a party all talking in the same direction, and he's done pretty well at that. Yeah, and also it depends on what cycle you're in, you know. When you're the leader of the opposition, when you've just got cleaned out, it's tough, you know, but politics is about cycle. Winning the second term has never been easy, particularly under MMP, so, you know, I think you sit the cycle about right. Can we, we've got about two minutes left now. So I want to talk, I do want to talk about the pandemic because it was, we dedicated a bit of time to that yesterday with Christopher Luxon and again this morning. Yesterday he talked about being overseas. He'd been in different countries, Christopher Luxon, this is, and saying that the world is moving on. You know, and I know that there is COVID fatigue here Aaltearoa, but is that this sort of message that we should be sending? Well, I don't think it's actually true. You know, I've got staff in Europe. They're looking at the seventh wave. There are, in many countries, still quite strong public precautions in place. They're calling for the third or fourth booster. So I just don't think that's factually correct. And, you know, we've still got a number of people dying and it's having a huge impact on our elderly. I think he's reading the room wrong. Well, that's what I was going to ask, is he? Is that the case? Well, I'd say more that he's six months behind. The government made a decision in January to move on from COVID. They could have cracked down again on the border when Omnachron was coming. They decided to let it rip instead. They wanted to have that first big wave in summer for probably good reasons. And both our main parties have said we're moving on. I mean, we've told we will never move back to red, but there might be some tweaks to orange, whatever that means. And it is true that, you know, in the rest of the world, yes, there's waves happening, but people's behaviour in the rest of the world has moved on from where we are, at least according to everyone I know that goes overseas. It's not a conversation point. All right. I want to finish with the Pacific Forum that's currently going on. And I guess the biggest part about that is the departure of Kiribatiahs, right, from the Pacific Island Forum. So I guess realistically, what can New Zealand do to try and entice them back? Well, I think that whole fanangata approach that Nanaama Huta and the Prime Minister is using is very important, and those connections are important. I'm deathly concerned about the Kiribis, and I think it's going to be the flashpoint between the USA and China. The Chinese have already built an airstrip there. The Kiribis have got a treaty that they're probably in breach with the USA, and Hawaii is just less than 3,000 kilometres away from the Kiribis, and, you know, I'm deathly worried about it and we need some action. But also we need long-term planning. And for a country like Kiribis, the number one issue is climate crisis. Matthew, I wonder whether you've got any comment about what New Zealand's role is to play in this? Well, the first domino has fallen, unless you call it the second after the Solomon Islands. China is a great power. China, like any great power, is expanding its footprint globally. We didn't like it. Māori didn't like it when the French and the British were doing it in the 19th century. People didn't like it in the 20th century with the US. But at least the French, the Americans and the British are democracies now. This is an altogether different proposition. This is not a democracy. It is a totalitarian dictatorship. And it is seeking hegemony across the Pacific. And it is a foreign policy failure for New Zealand over five years and longer that this is even happening. And in retrospect, it's obvious, but really any foreign relations scholar will tell you, what is an emerging great power going to do? It's going to expand. And we should have been more wary in our relationship with China, and we should have been more Pacific-focused for a lot longer. We're way over time like we always are every fortnight. Gosh, I really do enjoy these conversations. It's good to have you both back on the couch. Shane Capo, Matthew Houtin joining us this morning is our political panel and go the blues. Just saying.

Zero percent experience. What have I done? A hundred percent enthusiasm. So here goes. Oh my God. And time for Will's big reveal. Oh man, look at you. George Clark's amazing spaces, Sunday on 1 and on TV and Z-plus. Are we not white chile? We're not whitecheting, man. It's us. Welcome back to breakfast. We're coming up at a clock, but before that, everyone thinks of sharks as a daunting fin lurking in the water, but the number of sharks in open oceans has plunged by 71% in half a century. So is it time we stop being scared of them and start protecting them? We sent Tessa Parker to take the plunge and find out if they're friend or foe. Their top predators, cruising the ocean, preparing to strike. Or are they? They've got a terrible reputation. But are sharks really as bad as we think? It's Shark Awareness Day, so I've come down to Kelly Talton's to learn a little bit more about this misunderstood creature and I'm even going to go for a swim. Sharks were around since before the dinosaurs, but in 2022, nearly half of the 39 different species are endangered. Parking calls to help save sharks rather than fear them. Alright, who's ready for outfit reveal? Great, awesome. We got our nice wetsuit on, got the booties. Oh, ready to go. Matt works at Kelly Taltons. He voluntarily spends his days in the shark tank. No, I personally don't find sharks scary at all. Like, I think they're majestic animals and should be respected and admired. So you don't think they're intimidating at all? I'm more afraid of getting in front of the camera than jumping into a shark tank. He says even though they have a scary brand image, in reality, the big fish are pretty chill. On average, you're more likely to get attacked by a cow than a shark, you know, and I haven't seen any vicious killer cow movies. But despite the assurances from Matt, any hot tips for me? Don't drown. I'll take that on board. I'm not feeling too confident. Okay, it's shark awareness and I'm feeling very aware that there's just some sharks right there for I'm going to be swimming with soon. Yeah, right, stick around because later in the show we will get to see Tessa in the tank with the sharks. Good luck, Tess, good luck with that. Right, right now though, it has gone 8 o'clock. See he's in Dera with your latest news. Good morning. As COVID numbers continue to climb, a top doctor says the new variant is moving into our older population. It comes as the latest global numbers have New Zealand with the most confirmed cases per million people. More than 11,000 COVID cases were reported yesterday, up from around 10,000 last week. Dr Brian Betty of the Royal New Zealand College of GPs, says more elderly are being affected by the B5 sub-variant, adding more pressure on the health system. She protected the older population very well early on in COVID in New Zealand. However, with the rejection of mask use, winter with us being indoors, perhaps us listening, it started to move into the older age groups where we tend to see our most vulnerable in our population affected. The government is expected to announce free masks and rat tests later today and changes around vaccinations. A state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka. It comes as mass protests continue over the island's economic crisis, with President Kotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country ahead of his expected resignation. The acting president is relying on the military to restore what he calls normalcy. And Joe Biden has arrived in the Middle East on his first trip to the region as US president. Landing in Israel on day one of his four-day trip, the president says he's proud of their strong relationship, and he aims to promote stability and security, providing Israel with the most cutting-edge defense systems. Greater peace, greater stability, greater connection. It's critical, if I might add, for all the people of the region. President Biden will continue his talks with Israeli leaders before moving on to the occupied West Bank and Saudi Arabia. And now in sports news, it's been dubbed one of the greatest state of origin wins ever, as Queensland claimed, a spectacular series deciding game in Brisbane. Queensland opened the scoring through Valentine Holmes after a fiery opening 10 minutes. Their lead was short-lived as the Blues answered back with two of their own before half-time. He's put down centrefield on the 10. There's something cooking here. You bet it is. Jenkins Siphany. Scores the try for New South Wales. In moments after the break, Queensland winger Dane, Gagai and Bluesback, Matt Burton were sent off for this punch-up up at the second half belonged to Queensland as they put on a dazzling display to run in three tries to humble this interstate rivals. The final score, 2212. It's the third State of Origin win. We do come in here. It was going to be something special and we did it again. It's so good. To show you, if you missed it as our cameraman J.B, said score was 2212. To show you how much a series win meant Queensland, look, here they are, celebrating in the sheds. In Maroon's winger, Kaelin Ponga, was named Man of the Match. While forward, Patrick Carrigan was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as player of the series. So this next one is worth listening to. Yes, this story is worth listening to as well. With the first time in 25 years, Billy Joel is coming to Alpero. Yeah. I love Billy Joel for a one-off stadium show. He'll be bringing his biggest hits like New York State of Mind, Uptown Girl and Piano Man to Auckland's Eden Park this December. Look at more and put bread in my job and say, man, where you do and here? Oh, classic, honestly. Amazing songwriter, although I'm sure John Campbell would disagree. If you want to see the man himself, the first tickets go on sale on Monday. And taking a look at your weather this morning, starting off with a warning, heavy rain warning in place from midday in Northland, and this will stick around, yes, until early tomorrow morning. Make sure you drive to the conditions. Oh, I love it. To the top of the country, it's just heavy rainfalls all day, pretty much. That's what you can expect. Orpun and Fiteanga, you do have a cloudy morning. Enjoy it while at last. Don't hang out the washing. You'll be regretting it later. 16 degrees is your high. And heading south, cloudy day here, possible showers this morning. That will develop into rain later on and heavier falls for Pōonga and Fakata. 16 degrees, you're high. Now to the East Coast, a fine day for almost everybody here. That will become cloudy later in the afternoon. You can expect some evening rain as well if you're in Gisbon to watch out for. Marserton, beautiful morning, 14 degrees is your high. And crossing to the west. It's a cloudy day here as well. You'll get a few showers with rain, definitely in Tohmeranoi this afternoon. 14 degrees, the high there, and also in Wellington for a cloudy but windy day. Into the South Island, you're all in for a cloudy day here. Blenham, you'll start off pretty fine. Greymouth and Hockey Tika. You'll have morning showers but that will clear for a pretty good day for you. 13 degrees, your high. And further south. It's a cloudy start to the day here as well. You can expect some fine breaks later on this afternoon with the sun peeping out here and there eight degrees the high in Alexandra. Into the deep south, prepare for rain from Queenstown all the way down to the lucky to Stuart Island. We'll ease to just showers later on. But Milford Sound's going to be a good day, eight degrees your high. Thank you, Indira. What's your favourite be a good day. Eight degrees, your high. Thank you, Indira. What's your favorite? The piano man. No, New York State of Mind. Hello. Love. I was listening. Uptown Girl would be a loved Uptown Girl. And the Beach Boys did an awesome job too. What's the in the middle of the night?

She sings it with whatever's there and then doesn't actually know any of the words. River of Dream. Thank you, Sam. Anyway, hey, thank you so much for your feedback. Craig. Yeah, good question. What happened to Maddie's cheese rolls? You wait. What? Did's cheese rolls? You wait. What? Did you bring some? You wait. So yesterday, we interviewed the New Zealand's top cheese maker, and then during that interview, there was a conversation about cheese rolls, right? And you two, Ewan and Dera, said you'd never eaten a cheese roll before. And I said, sacrilege. Yeah. We cannot have that. And then I said, are you going to make us some, Maddie? To which you said, yes. So, did you make them? Yep. You didn't sauce. Can you look at me? Look at me. And answer that question. There will be cheese rolls. There will be cheese rolls on the table for you all very soon. That Maddie apparently made. Cannot wait. All right. I'll tell you what else I can't wait for is. Look at your face. Is this next story, the West Coast region was hit hard by the pandemic and international border closures with total visitor spend in the Glacier Country down 70% from pre-pandemic times. Around 170 locals across the West Coast have rolled up their sleeves to get involved with Doc's Jobs for Nature program. The funding from this has allowed rural coastal communities to get involved with threatened species analysis, track maintenance and weed control as well. Our Christchurch reporter Digby Worthmuller has travelled to the coast to share their story. Morena Digby. Morning from a very wet Poonikaiki and if you don't know where that is, it's just north of Greymouth. It's a rural coastal community and I'm joined by Sharon and Jenna who work at the nursery here as part of the conservation volunteers group. And morning guys, how are you? Good, thank you. Morning, great. Yeah, morning. A little bit wet, typical puna kiki fashion, isn't it? Just a shower. You can't have a rainforest that rain. You can't, you can't. Now tell me, guys, you guys are involved with this nursery. Jenna, you look after all the planting. What does that involve? So I manage the crew up at Bullet Creek, the planting site, getting our plants into the ground. So yeah, at the moment we're working on 60,000. By the end of the year, next year we've got to work on 120,000. So we're about halfway through our target at the moment. Yeah, so these guys do a fantastic job behind us here, getting these plants into the ground. Yeah, that's super cool. And these are some of the plants that are going to head up into the mountain. Can you tell me a little bit about those? So we have batches of a thousand that we take up at a time. So I collaborate with Sharon in the nursery to put these together. So we have batches of a thousand that we take up at a time. So I collaborate with Sharon in the nursery to put these together. So we've got this one right here is the bush edge mix. So that's a lot of stuff that likes a bit of shade and some of the bigger canopy species. We've got a wet mix, which is, you know, for the wetlands flacks and grasses and things like that. And then we've got a open pasture mix, which is all of the colonizers that kind of set the scene for the big stuff to come through later on. So, yeah. That's really cool. And look, your family's been here for a few generations, hasn't it? You're a real local through and through, aren't you? Yes, I'm really lucky. Yeah, we've been here since the early 1900s, I guess, and so it's nice having this fabulous job. It's my dream job, being the nursery manager here. And I've also got a wee bit of a connection to the petrels that are flying out to sea at the moment. My two uncles, when they were quite young, in the 1940s, they were involved with the school and took the teacher up into the colonies and it led to the discovery of the Westland Petra as a new species in the about 1945 I think it was Yeah and it's a type of bird that at this time in the morning it's the only place in the world you can see it actually fly out in typical West Coast fashion and it's raining and very cloudy so we can't see it happening but we well we can but so we can't see it happening. But we, well, we can, but the cameras can't. And what? They fly around the world? Yeah, it's the only breeding colony for the Westland Petrol here up the back, and they feed up their chicks to a good weight, and then they'll leave them sort of closer to the end of the year, and they'll fly through the Cook Strait back around to South America, so they're quite the international travellers. And the little chicks, well, they'll sort of lose a bit of weight and then gradually leave. That's pretty cool. I mean, there's just so much cool things going on around here out in rural New Zealand. Now, I'm going to take a little bit of a walk and you're going to come with me because we've got some of the workers here and we've got Dion is it? Yes. Dion, I got it right. Good morning. Morning. How are you? Pretty good. And tell me what are you doing? What's your job involved? So we're just getting plants ready to go and plant them up the creek. It's pretty dark as you can see in the morning. But it's beautiful morning. Never mind the rain. But your conservation never sleeps. And do you love what you do? Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I guess you wouldn't be here if you didn't, would you? I love what I do. Yeah, that's great. And look, we've also got Abby. Abby, we've got Abby here. Abby, tell me a little bit about why you're doing this work. I'm doing this for future generations. I'm my kids and, yeah, other generations to come. Just, you know just giving back to the Captain Planet. You know, you've got to look after it it's looking after us. Obviously yeah, I enjoy the job. That's awesome. And look that's us from Purnikaiki. Nice Digby. Go your good thing. Yeah. So if you're living on the West Coast it was a little bit dark in that shot, wasn't it, in that story?

Businesses are doing it tough, feeling the pain of inflation, and the burden of brain drain. But the girls that invest insist, this is all the more reason for you to push for that pay rise. Simran Cor is with us now to talk about the best ways to go about asking for a raise and how to show your value to your employer. This brings up so many questions for me. Morina. So good to have you back on the show and nice to have you in the studio. Thank you. I guess the first question is now really the right time to be asking for a raise? That is a good question, especially, you know, in this climate. I think a lot of people are starting to wonder that, and that's kind of the first barrier before, you know, going out and asking for the raise. But, you know, we've kind of, we're two, three years into COVID, and a lot of people have held back from asking. In fact, about a third of New Zealanders, you know, didn't get of, we're two, three years into COVID, and a lot of people have held back from asking. In fact, about a third of New Zealanders, you know, didn't get any raise in the last two years. But it's kind of time now to go, you know what, I have held off for a couple of years. We have been super understanding of our local businesses, but we've also got to take care of ourselves. And with rising inflation, up 7%, I think, now it's actually inappropriate time to say, hey, let's have a conversation. Okay, so how do we have that conversation? And I love this, because this is news you can use. So talk to me through the three steps. Yeah, so we kind of talk about with our community, this thing called the 3Ps, which is an easy and simple way of understanding how to go about asking for a raise. I think, you know, Kiwi culture, we're very humble. We don't want to talk about strengths and we don't want to talk about money. And so those are the two things you kind of have to talk about when it comes to a raise. So it's about kind of unlearning those. And the three P's, you start off with PrEP. And so PrEP is the idea of what have you done in the last six months or the last year that you can take to your employer, almost like a little list, and say, you know, I've increased sales by 10% or I've retained, you know, 5% more clients than the last year. Or even good feedback, you know, if you're in a service-based role, or you can say, you know, this was an email that I got. And so you feel more confident and you can get up there and you know kind go in a way that makes you feel good and present something exactly yeah okay so that's the first part second part second part is actually the price and I think that's the thing that people really get confused on you know how much am I worth how much do I ask for am I worth enough yeah and sorry we were having this conversation earlier I mean that's the hard part right is going you know Am I worth enough? Sorry, we were having this conversation earlier. I mean, that's the hard part, right? It's going, you know, am I good enough to ask for a raise in the first instance? And then go, oh, God, how much should I be asking for? Exactly. So how do we work that out? There's a few ways to do it. Now, living in New Zealand, we're a little bit of a smaller country, so we don't have a lot of data to work with. But there are websites like glass store, pay pay scale and even asking people in your industry, you might not be comfortable with asking your colleagues. You know, some companies have contracts where you actually can't do that, but it doesn't mean you can't ask people in other companies. You don't want to ask them what they're making directly. I think that's always a hard question, but even a range is better to work with. And so now you're able to go to your employer, and that's the third part, the present, where you've got reasons for what you've done well, and you've got a price or a price range to work with. And you can say, hey, you know, I'd love to sit down and have a chat, let's book a time, face to face, where we can discuss what I've done, and sort of the market rate for my skill sets that I have. And, you know, let's see what happens. You know, and even if you don't get the result that you want, actually part of it is just going through that process, right? Is going through that process of actually just backing yourself and asking. Absolutely. And, you know, the one thing I want people to take away is if the answer is no, you don't want to get up and walk away, you want to ask why and you want to ask, well, what can I do for next time? What are some, you know, actionable steps that I can take so that in six months from now we can review this and see, have I met them and if I have, you know, that makes sense for your employer. They want you to do well. And if you do well, they want to keep you and reward you for it. So you can definitely, you know, find some positive outcome. Yeah, I love it. Last time we heard you on, you guys were going gangbusters when it came to your podcast. How are things? How's business going? It's going well. We've had a million downloads in the podcast. Stop it. Absolutely crazy. But I think it's just, there's so many people out there that want to have these hard conversations about money. You know, how do you ask for a raise? How do you improve your skill set? And it's just a really nice community. Simran, so good to have you on the show. Thank you for that inside info. I love it. Simran core from Girls That Invest.

I've never really thought much because it's actually it's bread and cheese, right? Literally. What do you think? Oh yeah, mm-hmm. Good? You didn't make them? What kind of cheese? Oh yeah. Good? You didn't make them? No, I didn't make them. Thank you for being honest. No. Look, I had best intentions, but I got a little busy yesterday. So thankfully, the Whitestone cheese bar in Wyniard Quarter came to my age and made these for us. Well, can I say, thank you. And can I show, you and can I say, how good? On my first cheese roll.

Thank you very much, Madi. At the matter, here is your 830 news. One person has died in a crash near Moiraewa overnight. A car and a truck collided on State Highway 1 at quarter past 12. Police and other emergency services attended and occupant of one vehicle died at the scene and diversions were in place but have now been lifted. And Altheiro's soaring COVID numbers statistics are among the highest in the world. The latest global numbers has New Zealand with the most confirmed cases per million people. More than 11,000 COVID cases were reported yesterday. That's up from around 10,000 last week. Dr Brian Betty of the College of GPs says, while many people want to move on, there needs to be protection for the health system during winter. We've got a real concern that if these numbers continue to rise, that it puts additional pressure on the health system and it really, really puts strain on what's going on. So yeah, it's two sides of the equation, the impulse to say let's just move on, versus the reality of the pressures that's actually on the health system at this point. The government is expected to announce free masks and rat tests today in changes around vaccinations. A state of emergency has been declared in Sri Lanka. It comes as mass protests continue over the island's economic crisis, with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country ahead of his expected resignation. The acting president is relying on the military to restore what he calls normalcy. And in the US, the families of Yuvaldi's shooting victims say they were blindsided by the release of new CCTV footage detailing how the attack unfolded. The footage was meant to be shown to families before its release to the public, but a newspaper published edited portions of it first. The video shows officers approaching the door of the classroom with the gunman inside, then retreating for more than an hour after he opened fire, which fuelled criticism of the delayed response from law enforcement. And now to sport, order has been restored in state of origin, with Queensland winning a thrilling game three decider in the maroons. I know, sorry you're sick of this Jamie. And the maroons opened the scoring through Valentine Holmes after a fiery opening 10 minutes. The second half belonged to Queensland with a dazzling display to run in three tries to humble their interstate rivals. And there you go, Final score, 2212. And it's the Maroon's 23rd State of Origin win. On to real sports news. On to real sports news, says J. Mae. The Silver Ferns, Commonwealth Games, preparations are off to a strong start. Go the Ferns, winning their opening game of the Cadbury Series against a New Zealand A-side. And go the A-side too, actually. The second string line-up pushed the Ferns, winning their opening game of the Cadbury series against a New Zealand A-side. And go the A-side too, actually. The second string line-up pushed the Ferns in the first half, only trailing by three goals at half-time. But some clinical shooting from Maya Wilson, Grayson, Wicke and Bailey Mezz, helped their side to a runaway victory. The injury was sort of late-ish. How does she do it? Every single game now. The final score, 67-48 to the Ferns. And finally, for the first time in 25 years, Billy Joel is coming to Ateiro for a one-off stadium show.

It is 23 minutes to nine. Today is Decision Day in Christchurch. Will the City have its new stadium. We're joining us from the Christchurch newsroom as reporter Ryan Boswell. Morena, Ryan. So what are we expecting today? Good morning. Well, hopefully we get a decision one way or the other after 10 years of debate. The council's got three options on the table. One is to push ahead with the $683 million stadium to hit pause or scrap it all together. This is, as you said, Ryan, been 10 long years in the making. Why on earth has it taken this long? Well, Contabrians seem to like a debate and it's been going back and forth, the cost. There have been blowouts, the design, and of course, recently $150 million was added to the price tag. So the council's been asking the experts whether this is value for money or not. This week we got a fixed price contract, and that means that the price has been set at $683 million. So for ratepayers, they're hoping it's not going to balloon beyond that. Yeah, okay, so ratepayers, Cantabrians, Christchurch residents, what do they think about this? Are they in support of it going ahead? Well, there have been mixed reactions. Some are saying, given the uncertainty, the economic uncertainty, and the problems with the building industry, there are concerns that that price tag may increase. But there have been assurances by council staff that that won't happen. And then, of course, the rates rise. Contabrians are worried that they're going to be paying even more for their rates. But a recent survey was done, and in fact, 77% of Christchurch residents support this stadium going ahead. And of course, those behind many events around the country are hoping it does because the likes of Beyonce maybe and All Black's test will finally be able to arrive here in Christchurch. Beyonce, I don't mind the start of that, Ryan. So today's D-Day. Maybe a bit of Tate, Maddie. I'd love it. You're singing my sound of that, Ryan. So today's D-Day. Maybe a bit of T-T-T-T-T-A-Metty. I'd love it. You're singing my song-clock here, Ryan. Today's D-Day, of course, when will we get an answer? When will we know if the stadium's going to go ahead or not? Well, we're going to hear more submissions from the public today and those that are pushing for it to go ahead, and of course the opponents as well. Today, the meeting starts at Council at 10 o'clock, and it should be wrapped up by course the opponents as well. Today the meeting starts at council at 10 o'clock and it should be wrapped up by 5 o'clock today. So a decision one way or the other should be made. Of course we're holding our breaths and just wanting a decision after 10 years right? Yeah. Hi Ryan thank you so much for joining us this morning. Really appreciate it. Thank you.

Today. up quarter to nine. You know how it goes. You're in between meals. Your stomach starts rumbling. You open up the pantry and bam. All of a sudden, you're shoving a snack in your mouth. Just something little to tide me over, we tell ourselves. And with COVID changing the way we work, tuning our homes into our office, those snacks are within easy reach. So joining us now is registered nutritionist Claire Turnbull to make sense of this. Claire, good morning. Thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate it. Are we snacking more than ever before? We are. So research that was done in New Zealand over the pandemic really showed that snacking has ramped up. And, you know, it is something that's continuing. The other thing that I see a lot in my work is more and more people eating and drinking and nibbling and picking to manage difficult feelings. So if you're feeling stressed, you're feeling overwhelmed, you've got a lot in my work is more and more people eating and drinking and nibbling and picking to manage difficult feelings. So if you're feeling stressed, you're feeling overwhelmed, you've got a lot going on. The easiest place to gravitate towards is the kitchen or the alcohol cabinet. Which you can understand, right? It can be a bit of a comfort sometimes. It really can. It's a very natural thing to do to try and make yourself feel better. But unfortunately, it only is a temporary kind of band-aid over the bigger problems. And this kind of snacking and nibbling is really not helpful when it comes to people's health or their waistlines. Yeah, clearly COVID's had a massive impact on that. Like I said, working from home, of course, makes everything in really easy reach. Yeah, it does. And that's part of the problem. So when you are sitting at your computer or if you're working from home, of course, makes everything in really easy reach. Yeah, it does, and that's part of the problem. So when you are sitting at your computer or if you're working from home, when you need a break, you know, before you would have just maybe walked out in the office and chat to someone at the photocopier, but now you go into the kitchen and you put the kettle on and while it's boiling or whatever you're waiting for, you'll nibble and pick because it's your own food. It's easy to access. So access is really, really important to consider if you're struggling with this because if you've got things in glass jars or your pantries open or stuff on the bench, your brain will just kind of subconsciously you're just kind of picking and nibbling and not eating proper meals. Although is that sometimes you just can't help it, right? You have best intentions, you eat a good meal at breakfast or lunch or whatever it is and then three four o'clock in the afternoon your stomach starts rumbling you don't want to ignore the rumbling right? No I mean and there's a difference between like a consciously snacking maybe putting something on a plate rather than standing in front of the fridge or every time that you walk into the kitchen picking something. It is important to experience hunger. So one of the things that's happened is, you know, particularly I see this with children, they're a tiny bit hunger and they've got to have a cracker or a snack or something, you know, just to tide them over. Hunger is a really normal thing to experience. But certainly a nourishing snack in the afternoon, no problem. But if you're constantly picking and nibbling, it's, you know, not a lot of people are picking a nibbling on vegetables. You know, a lot of the time it's just a bit of cheese, but left over, you know, dinner from last night that maybe you don't need. Or the crackers, very, very easy to have lots of. And if people are snacking constantly and then not actually having a proper meal, what does that do for them? We need to have gaps between eating, okay? So it's really important for our body to do digestion and, you know, that eating process and have time without food because your body almost does different things during that time. The other thing when people snack constantly, particularly too late at night, it makes your eating window too long. And a lot of the new research is showing it's a really important to have a decent gap between your last meal and that first meal you have in the morning. And that snacking mentality just means that that gap for a lot of people is getting smaller. And again, you know, the key thing is a lot of the things that people are snacking on, they're not hungry. It's to do with managing boredom or feelings, which really need to be dealt with by walking outside or just doing something that is not eating when you don't need to be. Okay, Claire, if we are going to be snacking, though, what are some of the things that we could or should be having? Well, the things we need to be eating more up in this country are vegetables, right? So we need to be having five to six handfuls of vegetables a day. So if you chop up veggies and have them in your fridge, so they are the first thing that you see, it's easier to access. I make a batch of soup in winter every Sunday and I have it in a jug in the front of the fridge. So I have a mug of soup. It's the first thing I see. It is cheap. If you're using pumpkin carrots, I make a really good suit with frozen peas, onions. It doesn't have to be expensive. And then obviously nuts are a great thing. If you can pop your own popcorn, it's great, a bit of fruit. But essentially, yeah, when you start nibbling on the normal snack food, on the bars or anything else like that, it's expensive and also not necessarily that good for you. I get those bags of Scrogan from the supermarket, which do have nuts in them, but they do also have tiny little chunks of chocolate in there. They do. And one of the challenges is anything that you have salt in it, salty snacks, it will basically encourage you to eat more. So if you are genuinely hungry, the number of unsalted peanuts compared to salted peanuts will vary massively. So that is just something to consider is a lot of what drives us to eat more than we need to is the combination of salt, fat and sugars, which doesn't exist in nature. So in nature, nothing has fat and sugar with salt in it in that combination, which a lot of unprocessed food is hard to overeat. But when we get that snacky food, it's really difficult to stop yourself from eating it because your brain thinks it's wonderful and you just want to eat more of it. Claire, this has been really enlightening. And you're actually got something on offer for our viewers to actually help them out even further, right? Yeah, because so many people are struggling with when they eat. I'm running a masterclass in August called Back on Track to help you get your eating habits and behaviour and we've got two tickets to give away for breakfast viewers. So, yeah, hopefully I'll see two of you there. Amazing.

Gaila, welcome back to breakfast It is five to nine. Sharks are top of the food chain and crucial in protecting the health of our ocean. But they're disappearing at alarming rates due to overfishing and climate change. It's Shark Awareness Day and we thought what better way to celebrate this marine life that needs our protection than getting up close and personal Tessa Parker went for a swim. awareness day and we thought what better way to celebrate this marine life that needs our protection. Then getting up close and personal, Tessa Parker went for a swim. Sharks seem to have a bad rap. Always playing the villain. They aren't out to get people. They are really actually kind and quite docile animals and yeah, just have fun. So to see if they're really friend or foe, I made the trip to Kelly Toulton's to hop in the tank with them. Yeah, sweet. So we're going to head up to the top of the tank. I'm going to have the cage lowered in there and then we're just going to get to go for a bit of a swim around. All right, so we're in the water, about to hop in. The cage is all set up. What kind of sharks are we going to encounter in there? Cool, so we've got our Sandtogger sharks or grey nurse sharks. So we've got two boys and one female in there, and these guys are the biggest ones that people usually like to see the most. Then we've got our two broad-nosed seven-gill sharks. They're really cool. A couple of school sharks as well. And then we've got three massive short-towl stingrays. You know, some people feel uncomfortable seeing animals or fish or sharks kind of in cages or in aquariums. Do you kind of have an answer to that, I guess? We love these animals, and it's our job to protect them and sort of educate people about these sort of animals and inspire people to get out there and protect them as well. Awesome. All right, guys, I think I'm looking fabulous. I'm feeling fabulous. And now we're going to go swim with the sharks. So see you on the other side. As I squirmed around my tiny cage, I didn't even notice the masses of kids from the school holiday program staring up at me. Mom, somebody hit me with them. Because I was hanging out with some gentle giants. Yeah, honestly, guys, I wasn't scary at all. They're absolute chillers. I just felt like they were my besties, and we were cruising along with them. They are. They're a real cool animal, so we encourage everybody to come down and come see them. And, yeah, for Shark Awareness Day, just hope that people can do a bit of education on sharks and find out that they're actually really cool animals. Yeah, sharks have got the tick of approval from me. But time for a warm shower now. It's freezing. Great. Thank you. These creatures far more friendly than the movies make out. Tessa Parker, One News. So you just said you'd done this, but it wasn't even cage diving. I've got my open water diving certificate and we went diving with sharks in Fiji. What was the experience like? Incredible. It's slightly terrifying because they literally would swim right past you. But amazing. What was the advice you were given before you jumped in? Do you remember? In terms of not engaging or... I mean, I amazing. What was the advice you were given before you jumped in? Do you remember in terms of not engaging or? I mean, I'm sure it was their advice. It was a long time ago. I can't really remember. But it was just such an incredible experience. And they just swim around you? They just swim around. I mean, these are kind of, they're pretty docile sharks where we were. And they're, you know, they've been feeding them and kind of demesticating them as much as you can with the shark. Yeah. Yeah, it was an amazing experience. Jaws has just scarred me for life. In a healthy, respectful way, I think. Yeah. Yes. You know, if you're in their environment. Totally. Yeah. Anyway, go you, Tess. Yeah. Go you. Thank you for joining us this morning as well. Just really, really quickly before we go. We got a recipe from Brenda for cheese rolls. Cheese, onion, chopped onion, packet of onion soup, can of creamed, evaporated milk. Stir it all together. Make the sauce. Spread it on the bread. Away you go. I see. Because this whole time I thought, what's the big deal? It's just cheese and bread. But it's not. No. There's more to it in Dera. So much more. You could have actually done that yourself.
