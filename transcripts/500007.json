I do it a lot when I'm being a counselor with people. I'm doing it in anything. I want to know what my role is. I want to know how they see their role. And then I want to look at what our role is. You will be getting most of the power points on the website. Most of it. I'm going to take out the ones that don't make any sense. And I'm going to take out all the ones that have little video clips in them because they're just too big to send. But if you want to come and see the afterwards and get the URL for that. Let's see where we're going. George Bush, Sr. decided in 1990 that it was a deck out of the brain. So we had things like scans, MRI scans, functional MRI and so forth. If you've ever had one, it's quite a feeling being in that tube. It is not the most enjoyable thing and it's really noisy. So who's that one? Yeah, you'll know what it's like. And then we've come to this one here, which is for the fusion tensor images. Now I've got a little video clip, but look it up on YouTube if you want. It looks at little clusters of thousands of hours. So it's like a pinprick. And it'll actually trace them around. And we will see it in action like this. And Lance Armstrong began some work on this. I know he's not the flavor of the month at the moment. When he wants to be the testicular cancer, they said he had a 4% chance of living. And they wanted to change that mentally. So they showed, with this technology, they showed what it was like when he was thinking about the cancer. And then they did the same thing when he was thinking about health and about taking action and about what he could do. And he was vaccinated because he could see that he could actually control his brain like a machine. And he survived. And now he's going through his own little thing, isn't he? That's where he's going to be. So that's where we've got to. And that's led us into some knowledge. Now I was conopling this morning. Is that the right way spell there? Not sure. So if you're an Alley-A-D person on that, just stick with it. That's fine. What do you think of it? And it's not just in words. It's in feelings, it's in hesitations when somebody says, I don't want to be out there. Am I not quiet enough? Excuse me. It's like at one conference there, I had to leave, I left my key, I went into another room and I've taken the wrong sound system and I was wired up to room six. And they could hear me but the audience could. And this woman is in Australia and this woman stood up. She was about as far away as you were and she said, Mike, Mike, excuse me. Do I need to turn you on? I don't think I gave the appropriate answer. Yeah, it's your greatest thing and it's feelings, it's not just thoughts and we'll look at where those feelings are. So if I came near to you and you're getting some negative feelings, that's part of it. If I said I want a volunteer in your summer crops, that's part of it. It's all a lack of belief in what you can actually do. And I think that we've got a model of kids. I didn't do any public speaking when I was terrified. I then thought I could deal with 15 people, because I wanted to do this as a job. And then I got to my first big conference. They told me there was 89 people there. There were 289. I was terrified. I kept thinking 15. 15. Don't look at the match. Don't look at the match till I got going. Then I got to India. And there were 1,800 people at the conference, and they were in three tears, and they were swaying, and they were chanting about Sri Sri Sri Ravi Chandra, who was the god, he was on a chaise launch when I came off, and people were kissing and I thought, well, you don't kiss people's feet, I don't reason. And luckily, he sensed that, he just stood up and he bowed and he left the stage. And I thought, how do I get to 15 or 1,800 swan Indians who were going to Shri-Sri? So I think it was Queen or one of those groups that at Wembley Stadium, they came out and said, Good evening in there, England, or something like that. So I thought, these people knew my name of the conference, so there I am, and my little mic, this little pink guy standing on stage, and I stepped forward as much as I could, try not to look at all these swain people and went, Good evening, India. And back I heard, good evening, mate! That was such a cool moment. This is the thing, if you walk along the beach like so, your footsteps not only show where you've come from, but they're a great indication of where you're going. What's a thought that you've got in your head that is really good? What's a belief that you've got about you that is really good? I just want you to establish that in your head. And now I'm going to ask, have you got any doubt that is totally irrational? That really is holding you back from doing something, something that you want to do. If you don't want to do it, don't worry about it. But if you want to be a public speaker, but you think that you might make a mistake on stage, that may be holding you back. If you want to be a good, close teacher with kids, but you don't express your feelings, that may be holding you back. I want you to see if you've got one thing there. And could you change it? Could you? If you gave it a go. I'll just leave it at that. We all see the world very differently. We're learning more and more and more about that and seeing how they go. For example, look at this. Spot the error, because that's what they're doing. It's quite amazing, isn't it? But on first look, now I'm going to show you something else. I'm going to just whip into the other mode. Some people may have seen this. If you have, just keep it to yourself. We're going to see it once, and then we're going to see half it again. Get down there. Thank you. I'll just turn that up. Who murdered Lord Smiles, who at precisely 3.34 this afternoon was brutally bludgeon to death with a blunt instrument. I want each of you to tell me your whereabouts at precisely the time that this dastardly deed took place. I was polishing the brass in the master bedroom. I was buttering his lor-tips cones below stairs, sirs. But I was planting my petunias in the potting shed. Custible, arrest, lady smythe. But how did you know, madam, as any horticulturist will tell you, one does not plant petuniors until May is out. Take her away. It's just a matter of observation. Are you a question? Is how observant were you? Twenty-one changes in that scene. Now you're going to see them. Clearly, somebody in this room murdered Lord Smythe, who, at precisely 3.34 this afternoon, was brutally bludgeoned to death with a blunt instrument. Watch that beer. I mean, it's huge. Your warehouse at precisely the time that this dastardly did took place. I was polishing the brass in a master bedroom. I was buttering his lordship's scones below stairs, sorry. But I was... I was... I was......custible, arrest. Lady Smide. Okay, now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take it back to the beginning. Now that you know that there are 20... I'll just stop there. Now that you know that there are 20... I'll just stop there. Now that you know that there's 21 changes, I want you to see how many you can spot. And I've seen this probably 50 times, and I'm lucky to see seven. So just the first part. That's all that we're going to watch now. Clearly, somebody in this room murdered Lord Smide, who at precisely 3.34 this afternoon was brutally bloodened to death with a blunt instrument. I want each of you to tell me your whereabouts at precisely the time that this doubt was deemed took place. I was bulleting grass and last the bedroom. I was buttering his lordships go below stairs, sir. But I was planting my petunias in the pocket shed. Custible, arrest, lady smythe. How did you know, madam, as any horticulturist will tell you, one does not plant pet juniors until May. How many people are on the floor? Hang on, I've just dropped me south here. I'm picky, man. I've just got to work out. I do this on a regular basis, by the way. Have I got them the right way around? Thanks for that. I'm just a little tempering here. Okay? Okay. Sorry about that. This is like being the sheriff, you know, coming into one of the towns and reaching for your guns and seeing everything there. How many people on the floor? Sure? One, but that's changed. Sure? On the floor. Yeah, on the floor. Were there two people or was it the same guy with different clothes on? Are you sure? Do you have a haircut? Is it a week? You sure? Because I'm not. How many clocks were there? How many rakes? Two. Do you see the flowers change? Yes. Did you see the bear change in the armour? What about the deer's head? Oh, oh. Yeah, that changed as well. What deer's here? There was a deer here. See in the back corner by the painting? The guy with the red jacket on the left-hand side? There's a deer's head out there. the back corner by the painting? The guy with the red jacket on the left hand side? There's a deer's head out there. Okay, so my question than that, how good are you at picking your students' potential? Or possible potential? Or the next step towards there. How good are you are doing it? And you may be pretty good because you're an outsider. But here's my big question. How good are you at choosing your looking and being able to identify your potential what is your next step in life so I'm 61 now I've tried to take up new things each year it's been karate this year it's been great I've just passed my white belt belt with black tassels I've only got eight more to be a black belt but I know when I'm going to get there for that it'll be towards the end of 2014. That's my goal of the state if the body holds out to see where I'm going. But I have friends who help me identify some stuff as well. When I'm ever having a doubting moment, which doesn't happen too often, I have two or three people in my life, special people, who say things like, you can do this, Mike. I know you can. Really? Of course you can. Oh, Mike? My name can. Really? Of course you can. Oh, thanks. So who have you got? Who have you got in your personal life? Who have you got in your teaching profession, in your professional life, who can help you identify the next step? Now, you may be really good at doing it yourself, but sometimes it's nice to have a feeder person as well. Just to be there. So who have you got and hopefully they're in this room it'd be even better just to see whether they're you might say I don't want to take the next step well guess what you're gonna have to because it'll come to you anyway you can say I'm not going to change in my life you will things will happen to you some of them are called things like death marriage things to do with bankruptcy, change the job, change of houses, all of those things that are all major shifts in your life. They will come to you whether you like them or not. The more prepared you are, the better it is just to see. That doesn't mean that you've got to look to the future with fear and worry. They're just being saying, I know that the life will change. So who have you got? Who's got somebody? Who's got somebody personally? Sorry, I should split this. Who's got somebody professionally? Somebody who they trust? Doesn't have to be above you, below you, beside you, wherever. Anybody who ever, don't even put your hand up. If anybody hasn't got somebody, see if you can find one. Pretty good. Because we spend a lot of our life doing this, don't we? Just read it to the first and we think. What's what happened? And our brain is designed to do it. Those people who win mastermind, all the quirky quiz shows, are very unusual. That is not how our brain generally works. Our brain is designed to jump to conclusions. Obvious reason, when we lived out the forest, the caves, and everything. You can't be sitting there when a mammoth is chasing or charging you and go, my goodness, look at that. Now, if I did a physics analysis about force and momentum, mind you, if I killed it, how many families could I think. You've got to make a decision. And sometimes it's going to be the wrong one. Who's made a wrong decision in their life? Who's learned? Teach from it. Yeah, exactly, because you can't make a wrong decision. That's something that I've learned. Whatever decision that you make will take you down a learning path. And that's really cool to know that. And when you're sitting there and going, I can make a decision you just made one you've made a decision not to make a decision but you have made a decision you've made a decision to just sit and wait and sometimes that seems to sometimes it's not they have does that affect kids well we're all made up of prejudices our own prejudices about people and they're stored in two different parts of the brain they're stored in a place Well, we're all made up of prejudices, our own prejudices about people. And they're stored in two different parts of the brain. They're stored in a place where meadala, which is the Greek word for Amman. And this doesn't have language. It's a fear and phobia and emotional, a feeling sensation of place. It's very deep down in your brain. And it was your main mentally center for the first three and a half to four years of your life. That's why if I see you at the moment, can you remember what it was like to be two? You can't. But you might remember a photo of you doing something, but that's not a memory. That's somebody else's memory that they brought forward since you've been older. Then on top of that, we grow at our place for the hippocampus and that's our memory of words, pictures and situations and they're two different and they work together. So you get feelings about a situation, intuition and you also get words to describe it. And that's what they act like. And that's what they act like. The bottom one in the hippocampus often call our subconscious. It's like the bottom of an iceberg. It's huge. When you want to go one way and it's going the other, then you won't get there. So if you set a task, but you have a lot of believing doubts in there, you're probably not going to get there. We've got to convince both to go the same way. This is when people say, I want to make money, and I say, what are your beliefs about money? What did your parents say? Oh, money didn't grow and freeze. You've got to work for it. You know, it only comes to those who are in bus areas. All those things are going to stop you getting that. When you're going to look like. When you're born, your amygdala is working really hard, as I said. For about the first three, four years, that's where we're scoring everything in there our brain's very emotional on that point because it cannot think of logic because it hasn't got a logical function going not really it's it's just learning in its way this time here is very fragile whatever people tell you is correct you will believe it so you were told at that time that Father Christmas existed you were told that there was a tooth theory you were told various other things and how long did you believe them for to share now with the person next to you when you stopped believing in most things friend about stop believing in my continued to believe it. So somebody told you that Father Christmas wasn't there, that was your parents, but in your own head. I mean, you laughed and smiled and said, yeah, I know, I know. But your own head, you said, no. No, my parents wouldn't do that. They wouldn't lie to me. So we generally keep it till about nightish, maybe even further. Now for those people who are still there, that's fine. Come and see me out of yours. Some people say I'm related to this guy, so I know, we just work away on that. And this is because these are sewed into your amygdala memory, and they come from significant people. Now, if you're told during this time that you're fat and ugly, that's what you'll accept. And you'll see it in the mirror. If you're told that you've got huge potential, that's what you'll believe. Lisa Carrington's father, right from early age, told her that she could win an Olympic gold medals. How's that? And she went on to fulfill it. And of course, they were as proud as anything about the whole thing. But they sewed that all the time, because they saw that she was interested in a very sporting family to get down. These sorts of non-conscious. But there's a negative to positive to positive ratio now they begin to have a significant effect on our conscious performance. Now for all of you were teaching in the bottom area of the school, basically in primary, we have a significant problem. We have to overpower some of these negative beliefs. You know that, and it's a challenging job, isn't I? We've got to focus them on what they can do, not what they can do. We've got to look at things like Miss Hates and see whether we're going. We've got to conjure up success. And we've got to get rid of national standards. It's just a bawling. And I believe our suicide range is going to go up because we work with these kids. Five-year-olds who, on their report, it says, will never achieve the standard. Never. Goodness me. So if everyone's school writing that type of trite, stop writing it because we're really harming people. Look at their potential. And you know what really gets me, and I'm not going to get stuck into this, how can you rate somebody halfway through the ear on something that they're supposed to do at the end and so they're not achieving it? Of course they're not. They shouldn't be. And if five out of five get their standard, isn't it too easy? And why don't we national standards every subject to make it fair? To give them some bite and some meaning. So that's what I'd do I'd be doing that all right anyway I won't go down that path because that's a bit of soapbox so there I am in my basically my junior brain and talk about puberty by puberty I can experience all of these emotions I can't control them so you will know that who's an intermediate too you know sorry you know laughing crying yah and but no, not too much sense, having in their room. Those emotions dominate what we do. They're absolutely insistent on seeing where they're coming. Okay, now we're moving into post-cubity. Now you have the campus is weakly starting to get cracking there. So your memories are getting stronger and stronger between the two. I'll let you read that. So let me go back to the negative one that I've talked about. Some significant people continually told you that you were fat, an ugly or clumsy or whatever. Let's work on a clumsy one. My father told me that I was no good with tools at all. I don't know why he told me that, but he told my sister that she was very good with thoughts. And my sister is very good at the horse, and I'm not. So I've built my house, basically to prove my father that he was wrong. And it probably took me three times longer than the average. But I learned he, so as my confidence got up, I became better and better and better at doing it. Because I wanted to cancel that belief out because I didn't like it. Now, those beliefs then become logical. So if it's a clumsy thing, what happens is if your teenage years and later in your life, whenever you drop something, you say, no, I wonder that they told me all was clumsy. Look, I am clumsy. So you find the proof. And that proof builds you because you're just memory. That's all that you are. You're a memory of where you go. Now we're going to see what some of these are and for some of you this could be quite uncomfortable you need something to write on please it could be your iPad your iPhone it could be an old-fashioned piece of paper or if you're even older it could be a block of stone and a hammer-up of the table mark. You are not going to show this for anybody in the room. That's really important. You are going to give your first week action only. Please don't think about it. When I mention something, you're going to write down the first thing that comes into your head. And if it happens to be nothing that comes in the head, write down nothing. And then don't change it. Just leave it there. We're going to go through this and see where they're going. Okay. So, everybody got something to write? Do I need to wait at all? Give me away with your partner is all set all? Give me a wave if your partner is all set up. Give me a way for your partner's all set up? Yeah, it's pretty good. Okay, it's early morning, you're in the basket. You're having a shower. Luckily, you've got a dingister on the mirror. You step out of the shower and see your body. What's your first reaction? First one? Don't think about it. Just write down the first word. First word or words. first reaction first one don't think about it just write down the first word first word or words really good what do you think about okay don't change it I'll move me on if we looked around this room your school or any group of people in public how would you rate your intelligence first thought write it down group of people in public. How would you rate your intelligence? First thought. Write it down, don't change it. How successful have you been in life so far? First reaction. Rate it in whatever way it you like. If we were doing some type of rating, how attractive for you? Oh, it's uncomfortable, isn't it? Just write it down, whatever it is, make sure if something's down. And don't change it. Last one, if people were rating you as to how worthwhile you are as a person. What would it sound like? One or two words at all. How will it? How will it? I'm going. At the last look at it, most people with the right head, I'm not sure if you can turn it over, close it, or whatever. But I just want you to know what you're written, and then just put it down somewhere so it's not there. And I want you to come on a little journey with me in two forms. First of all, if you are comfortable closing your eyes when I say get ready, close your eyes. Now, for some people you won't be comfortable, just de-focus. Look at the table, look at the carpet, look at the wall, do whatever, but just you're away with it. And I'm going to take you on a little journey, it's not a harmful journey, a little story, and I want you to just seek yourself in it. Okay? We're all ready? Good Scott. I want you to see yourself as you, but not at this age. You're round about seven, eight or nine. So a young girl or a young boy. You are in a park. And I need to put some things in this park before you define the park. There needs to be a park in the park. There needs to be some trees and some grass. And there needs to be a park bench or seat that will take up to three people. You, as a seven or eight or nine-year-old are sitting on one end this is really important on one end of the park bench or seat not in the middle along the path comes a grandmotherly or grandfatherly figure now they're not your grandmother or grandfather but they're about same age. You see them coming along, you're feeling quite safe. They look quite smiling, they're friendly, it's no freak. And they ask if they can sit on the park bench beside you and you quietly nod your head or say yes, everyone's suits, and they do so. And then they begin talking and using the identical words that you wrote on your page, they describe your body. And using the same words that you use, they describe your intelligence. And using the same words as you used they tell you how successful you are and using the identical words that you used they describe how attractive you are to other people and using the same words that you used they tell telling how worthwhile you were going to be in life. How does the seven, eight or nine-year-old feel at this point? And when you're ready, just get me coming on back. And some people will even have noticed a temperature change. Notice it? Anyone find the room a bit cool? Isn't that fantastic? See, that's what negative thoughts can do. And we'll just look at that and say. Some people might not notice that. But the room has lost some energy, hasn't it? Now, for some people, this would have been an amazing journey, and they would have gone, yes, wow, gorgeous, you're very rare, very unusual. For most of you, it would have been a rocky road and a couple of things you would have gone. And a couple of little ones there, and for some people it would have been negative all the way through. Who's doing the talking to who? You are to you. This is what you're saying in your own head about you. And this is the type of things that our kids are saying all the time and they don't think that anybody else is having these stores. They think it's only them. So it's really, really lonely. I'm the only kid who comes to school and thinks that kids hate it. I'm the only kid who never get selected for a team. I'm the only kid who drops the board every time it's run. I'm the kid that the teacher never asks questions because you know I have got an answer. I'm the only kid who never gets chosen for a job. I'm the only kid who has no potential when it comes to having my name up on the honest board. I'm the only child who has no potential when it comes to having my name up on the honest board. I'm the only child whose parents don't care. That's where some of our kids are, that's where some of us are. Not a great place to be, isn't. But you can change it. You can change it when ever get your life. Let's warm the room up a little bit at the moment. Okay, take up a stand. No, room up a little bit at the moment okay take up stand a second without sharing the word I want you to just share with somebody what does have experience like for you or together and in fact would you like to do it again or would you not you need to improve some things or whatever just have one those things or sort of chats and if you don't want to chance itself The President The President On the I'm The We're Two things that I need to explain. The reason why I did the first activity, I want you to know what's going on your own head. And hopefully you can say, I need to change it in certain ways. And it's funny as we get older that the whole thing the trackness changes that you see people and often you just look at their eyes and they're sparkling and you go wow what a gorgeous person and you see gorgeous people all around it when you know that you're gorgeous that's when you really see them but then I did that warm up activity literally a warm-up activity, because I can't keep us there in that freezing area, because it's not a comfortable place to be. Know that this is where our kids are. And are we ever going to achieve success when they're thinking like that? I don't think so. I think we've got massive potential. I like the way that ERO said, How are you moving children towards that potential? I said, we're not. I said, what do you mean we're not? I said, because I've got no idea what their potential is. I don't even know what mine is. See, what are we going to be doing at 80? I don't know, but it's going to be pretty fantastic. It is going to be really need to do whatever it happens to be. Oh, yes. By the way, our hepatitis is still working throughout our life. It's the one that's always on the lookout, I see what's happening there. Why I'm clicking through? Can I just start, sorry, the hippocampus that changes and grows, is it? Hippercampus is pretty dominant and it's larger in teenage years than it is in the rest of our life. But as soon as we get into a fetus factor situation, it becomes more alert. And so he's spending any type of time into it in a long-term thing. It's very dangerous. It's a cancer cause it. It produces a hormone of cortisol, which is known to, first of all, it's associated with Alzheimer's, associated with Parkinson, with cancer, with heart disease. So those negative thoughts are not good, and if you look at people with longevity, they're very buoyant people, aren't they? You don't get people celebrating 100%, man, I have life. I've had 98 years, I'm thinking, why am I here? They're still pulling out the parts of life that they can do. They're saying, well, I can't do that, but it doesn't matter. I can do other things. It's really cool. And it's saying life does begin in here. You can change all of this because it is just a memory. It's not true. It's something that's not sewn in. So it's on your hard drive. Take it off. Put it in the trash. And empty the trash. Mike, is it that simple yes some parts of it up you decide to do some parts are that simple to do it's awareness of your thoughts and when those thoughts come in those self-critical thoughts they're very slow they're about 200 kilometres an hour but when it comes to action it's 160,000 kilometres now you. You can't stop that. You stop it at the thought. And after a while, you begin to actually chew your words. So I'm scared to say, I could do that. Yeah, that'd be quite late. And then it becomes a brain habit. Takes about how long? That's 21 to 28 days. Because if you think of a push-ball, a brain cells a little bit like that, grows hairy dendrites out. When we change your habit, it denudes them. After about nine days, they're on. Then it starts to grow new ones. But if you change the habit during that time, the old ones will start to grow. So it's got to be 21 days, sort of believing in your new habit. 21 to 28. And then, I've got a constant work keeping it going. Look at the ratio, accepted 6 to 1, more recently 30 to 1 or 90 to 1. 19 negative thoughts or failings for every positive one. Wow, that's no good is it. Let's go back to when Joe and I were demonstrating telling the good things about our teaching. How comfortable will it. Because it should have been very comfortable. The hardest part should be, I don't want to tell you one. I want to tell you ten. And it's not striking. It's been passionate about who you are and what you're doing. We're different from a computer. And a computer garbage in and our brain garbage in garbage gross one cell talks a 10,000 talk to a million talk to a billion if you know at night and you can't go to sleep because that thought keeps coming round and round the head that's an action so you start having negative thoughts or our heads have negative thoughts. They're going to grow and grow. They become a slippery slope. I'll go back to that one, sorry. They become the slippery slope known as ants. They have a prediction. What is ants mean? We haven them. First word is all the minute. What do you think the N stands for? Negative. What is the T stand for? Thoughts. There they go. So, you have a ten eight. So, you have a teenage daughter of your son. You give them a curfew, up at 11, and they need to be home. It's all me night. It's now 10 past 12. You're sitting there stewing. You're going to have a real earfold when they come home because you love them. You're going to let them know that you're angry because you love them. The phone rings. What comes into your head? What happens to your stomach? Now that thought is 200k. Your stomach is about 100,000k. Now you might be into train or something. You go up and you ask the phone and the voice comes over at Sgt and Such from the Alice Lee police station. Now where are you in the situation? When you come get up a whole other things in your head, I need to tell you that your daughter's fine. We found her out the street taxi driver did this or whatever and you are going to barrel her when she comes say okay because you love it so we all have automatic negative flaws in the school situation what produces your major automatic negative flaws what are some of the situations that do it because i want you to be aware of them there'll be certain situations where you go to self-doubt, anger, all of those things. I want you to know what they are so that you can deal with them better. What are they? You might have three or four or five or six, doesn't matter. You might want John and Dan, you may not, you might want to have better. Then I'm going to get some feedback around the room. I normally walk around, but I can't walk around because it's really no space. But that doesn't it? Let's see where we go and get some feedback from around the room anyway. Give me away who's got one, an automatic input. The guy at the back and could give some volume on that question.'s why I see you in office that's a view because as a principal I used to say to somebody can I see you in the office you just see their face and I said it's good and there's like yeah my here isn't that interesting so much and we've got no group have we except when I went back to sit outside secondary principles doors as an adult to talk about professional development, it was really uncomfortable. Because I spent so much time out there as a student waiting to get the cane or whatever. Great one. Okay, what else are we going? Yeah. Parents coming in, especially those with a little tag on the head. About such and such and such. Now, I'm going to go tag on the head. About such, such, and such, and such. Now, I'm going to go back to your first one because we could say, that's cool. I'm looking forward to the meeting. And with our parents coming in, a good thing is to just join them on us, isn't it, to get away from that teenish match, or your son did this and all the fence and everything else. We used to often work away, but I'm so glad that you came in. Because I was going to bring you, I probably should have last week, I need to talk to you about your son, your daughter, whatever. How are you finding them at home? And they go, ah, so I'm not on my own. No, you're not. We're in this together. And that's sort of the views that. Will you get the odd angry parent coming? Yeah. Are you the target? No, no, you're not. So sometimes you might think about cutting the strings. Now I usually use this a lot. I'll tell you a story of where this happened and I used to use puppets a lot in school. My sister was four years old than me. When she was about 10 and I was a very early developer. You can see by the height and everything else, which is normal. Puberty struck early and girls. Oh man man that's what I went to school before at about the age from then on girls were just gorgeous they were just but I was really shy and my sister knew that and so she used to bring out that same little rhyme that kids do now yeah go girlfriend yeah and man they just got my little men who were going so I would go to head of punches you know do whatever mum or dad would come out I'd get a good hiding this was in the days before Sue Bradford And then they just got my amygdala going. So I would go to head, punch us, you know, do whatever. Mum or dad would come out. I'd get wood hiding. This was in the days before, Sue Bradford. And then I'd set the bed without tea. I didn't learn anything. Because it wasn't a logical reaction. It was an electrolyte. Except when I was about 10, and my sister was a smooth 14-year-old with even more power, I suddenly decided that I knew what I was going to do. I was going to counter what she was going. And I thought it through. It was brilliant. It should have been on a film. So she started in, dad, again. I had a girl. It's an old story. I could feel the anger rising and I said, this is so cool. You're going to appreciate this. This is like a good, bright look. And I said, so well. You've got a word drink. Thinking, oh, yes, yes. And she said, that's right. And his name's wrong. Now hang on, I said, let's rewind. I just gave me that good hit. You walked away. What she did, and I found this later, is she cut the strings. And I learned to do that. So if you see above you, when the parent comes in, a cross thing there with a whole lot of marionette things coming down, attach it to a coat on you. I've heard this recently. When they come in full anger, don't let them control you. See a giant pair of scissors, and you keep cutting the strings. Now somebody said to me that then I fall over and that's why I brought out the coat. So all that you're seeing is a coat line there. It really works. It's safe but it works and teach at the kids. When people say, he made me do it, say you're quite happy that he's in charge you? No. And that's why I had the puppet there and say, if we cut the strings, what happened? So how do you cut the strings? So when we say kids just walk away, that's the hardest them going. I'm calling you a fat-headed idiot. And you're expected to walk away? Could you do it? Not very often. We walk away and we say, I'll have a go, I'll have it again. That's really tough to us, but if we give them a technique, like cutting the streams, really powerful. And have a puppet there, or marry a net, is a property. Any other, automatically, connect the thoughts. Let's have a couple more or marry a net is a property any other automatic negative thoughts let's have a couple more we've got the parents we've got the principal's office how do we have to have someone come to observing okay coming and observing now think of the automatic negative thought it actually says I'm not worth observing but they have asked you especially to come with you so there's something that they want to see so you you especially to come to see people so there's something that they want to see so you might want to say to them and clarify it and say what exactly do you want to see why do you ask to come to my ribbon now if it's a negative thing then there's something a bit second the score there really is because we know that people work best when we look at their talents their strengths and we gradually grow their deeds and overcome their witnesses. But if they say, because I've heard that you're a really good mass teacher or a really good social studies, science, drama, whatever it happens to me, do a bit of bathing in that and say, well, no, really good. And then sit down and say, what do I actually do well? Sir Lawrence Olivier, true story apparently, he did something about Hamlet, and he had four curbing cords. It was so brilliant what he did on stage and they found him in his dressing room, he was crying. And they said, Sir Lawrence, why are you crying? That is the best performance you've ever done. And he said yes, but I don't know how to do it again. You need to know what you do well and the more more you appreciate that, you'll get to the point. See, we've got the video camera rolling. That doesn't worry me at all. Because I'm confident in what I do. But I wasn't. That took me some time. You're looking in a journey of 20-something years because I was totally fed up with being the way that I was. And they were all memories. One more. Yes, Sam. Good. Nice way. and they were all memories the whole one more yes yes good nice way report writing why is it negative what part is not getting it right who's head who's head the report writing team they They cut these strings. What I'd like you to do when you're writing a report is celebrate your part in their journey. Not just their journey, your part in their journey. So when you think of that child, how would we together the main difference? How's that excited you? How's that filled you with a bit of passion? Put the passion on a report. Once this passion in a report, I don't see that anyone can change it. There's no right to do it. I can't spell. So writing reports to me was, actually it doesn't marry me now that they can spell. That's their problem if they can find those all the better because I need to put it for it. But you celebrate that joint part with it. And it's only their opinion, isn't it? Unless it's something mechanical, unless they say, you know, your sentences are really clumsy or whatever else. If so, hire somebody else, they're like, high around. See where you go. This is what negative thoughts do was. A lot of really neck things. So, that brings all of these, the more pressure on your reports, the more likely you are to get them wrong. Because you go into that filter. So the brain says that's where we're heading, that's it. And of course these are all the things that they bring down. So they're really good to have actually. And if you want to lead a short, very unhappy life, they're brilliant. And remember all the time, this is our kids at school, and we're going to get on soon to what we can do about. This is what they do scientifically with the hormones, with the transmitters and so on and that. This side produces serotonin. Wouldn't have more serotonin than men generally. It's the calming hormone that we have. Dopamine is the focus hormone. It's that one that kids do this, repetitious movements will get there. It's to help them really get into it. So all of these positive thoughts really do something for them. I was working with a whole group of secondary students the other day, and we were looking at exam techniques and what to do. And apart from the the study which we looked at we looked at going into the room and at the door you just go yes and when you sit down and you have a question that you think that you can't answer you raise your eyebrows just raise your eyebrows at the moment like this now try and have a negative thought that's pretty hard to do in fact let's just try something just at the moment let's just see what our body language and all, because we teach us the kids. I want you to slump. I want you to just slump down. If you're writing, just stop writing at the moment and slump. And I want you to repeat these words after me in the same tone. I'm really happy. This is the most happy I've been. Imagine how joyous my life is going to be. I'm probably the most successful person I've ever been. Let's just stop there and think of how kids are sitting at times when they're working. Like that. It's really negative. Now I want you to put whatever you've got down. I want you to stand up as you can. I want you to straighten your shoulders. I want you to put your head slightly up. Just slightly up. I want you to lift your eyebrows. And I want you to put one of those smiles on your face, that it's that when the guy's gonna take a photo, we're all there, yeah, there are here, and he said, hang on, see, I've got a problem with the camera. So I went to freeze that smile. I went to be looking up, you should remember the shoulders there, and repeating these words after me. I'm an accident, I would get failure. Everything in my life has happened is goes bad. If you want terrible things, just leave with me. And once more I know it's going to get worse and worse. You can't do it, can't. So just in an exam, if a child is having problems, and you just raise the eyebrows, it increases potential. But if you go, I can't think, think harder. Well, you've ever done that with somebody's name? So we meet each other in a party. And then after two minutes conversation, I go, well, thanks very much, and it's gone. But at four or five in the morning, I suddenly remember. So it gets the harder that they try, what this is be so we need to have a relaxed shoulders back if you get stuck shoulder's fine but it's that simple to change what we believe to change how we go good you can read those for yourself apparently we need 12 positive interactions with people. In our school we had a lot of touch going on, we had a lot of hanging going on, we had a lot of massards going on. Was it risky? No, not really, especially once we began doing it. It was never compulsory. It started in some rooms and then spread to others. The staff used to do, I could walk around on the morning, get massards in four different classroom. That's great. Year 8 and all said if they didn't have that massage then, it just a morning, get mass ads in four different classroom. That's great. Now, year eights and all said if they didn't have that massage thing, it just sport that whole day. Because it was just a calming downtime. They used to assess it as well. How good was your masseuse? Now, some people say, I couldn't do that. That's fine. But some people say, yeah, that's really cool. We only did the shoulders, the shoulders. That was all. And we didn't do it in a circle because you can't get and receive we did it with a partner you give and get it changed out of and receive stronger memory stronger immunity system this reduces cortisol I've talked about that and adrenaline and too much adrenaline destroys the system look at what it amounts to especially in anger these are the effort for. Okay, now I think I'm coming in some work from a guy called Masaru and Motto. Who's heard of it? Japanese scientists, thank you, who studied water for the last 40 years. For the first 20 years, what they did was that they would have a little vial of distilled water or water from another place but generally still. And they would make a negative or positive comment to it. They would then freeze it, take it out and then do a microscopic photo of what the water itself had formed. People sent to a mark for 20 years, but it's not the thought, it's the tone of voice. That's what's forming the water. So he changed it. So he wrote it on a little piece of paper. They wrote words like, I hate you, and all those types of things. Put it on there, did the same thing, froze the water, and then did a microscopic quota. Now, you don't have to believe this, looking up on website or whatever. But all I'm going to say is that we're about 85% water and your brain's about 93% water. So are pluses and minuses just affecting our water? That's the question. Throw this out if you don't like it. I hope it's on that. Yeah, that's good. That's on the little cell. It looks pretty sick, doesn't it? It looks like your hands are south. But have a look at this one. Just saying a word like thank you. Oh, how are you on that? Can I talk to your partner about that? Maybe a little fun uncomfortable. Feel free to say that's a lot of rubbish. You know, I don't accept that at all, or you might say. That's a bit interesting. Mazaru Emoto. M-A-I-U-M-O-T-O. He's now to look at the most of the very special substance. Apparently, it is the as a very special substance. Apparently, it is the only liquid that can go upwards. So if you spill water and you've got a towel, a suspended towel, it'll creep up the water after the towel. Apparently, no other liquids do that. Now, quote me on that one carefully, that's his words. Quite an interesting man. Quite interesting. Yeah. I'll see that the Beade was like a bleak a woman. Yeah. Anybody see that? What the bleak? Do you know the film? Yeah, he was on there. And he's got a great website. He can get into it. He comes to New Zealand quite often and speaks. A little bit challenging to understand because of a very heavy accent. But it's photos. I'm just worth it. If you put Adolf Hitler up, that's where you get something like that. If you put Sister Mary Leo up, that's what you get. So just the names. It seems to be able to read them. Now, this is quantum physics, and I spend a lot of time now with quantum physicists. It's mind-blower as to the power of thought and what it does, that they are convinced that thought creates things. If you think negative, you're a track negative. So how accurate are some of the thoughts that we have? I want to take you on a personal journey. I'll take you one with my sister. This actually involves her as well. When I was about five, I went to school like we all did. Now I've never been to preschool because we lived well out in the country. And on about first second birth, something like that day, I went down this corridor in the juniors. It was about three kilometres long. It was all polished liner. And I dredged down to the end there. I don't know how many days it took me, but it was quite a long time. And I went down and there was a pretty looking nurse there. Not heard, but, you know, somebody's similar. And she said to me, would I please bear my arm, which I did? She said, face the other way. And then she got nail pullers like this, and she put them on my arm, and she sweeps the skin and twisted it and twisted it. And I think I remember her laughing. I think I did. Now I ran up that 3-kilometer track in about 10 seconds and I went and head under the bush and I went for my mother to come and pick me up because I was a very scared boy. Very vivid. But it's not that. You see there's a couple of things in there that are wrong. She told me to look the other way. And I saw her with these nail collars doing this on my own. Then I ran up the horrible, true I think, and I head up the edge till my mother came to get me, which is impossible because we didn't have a car and she couldn't drive. However, that is what is stuck on my head in my head, 30 sections of life. What I don't remember, but apparently it happened, was about two weeks before my sister, she's there again, the one with you've got a girl friend. She took me down to Dad's talkshed. Remember I said she was really good with tools. And apparently, she brought out a hair of black nail pullers, a bit like pliers. And she put them on my arm and twisted it. What did the nerves do for me? What did I sashage? It did I have some shaker too? It pain. So memories are really confused. What memories have you messed up in your head? You got them? If you go back to the town or city that you were brought up in your head? Do you have got them? If you go back to the town or city that you were brought up in, it looks smaller, isn't? Not the same that it was. The school doesn't quite look the same. There's all sorts of things, and they're not true. That's what I'm saying to you. Whatever you believe are at the moment, they're not true. But let's get the good ones and build them up. And let's get rid of the others. Cut them run away women have been somewhere burn them attacks and go parachute there were all sorts of things with them they get rid of them this is the type of thing that Lisa and I used to do we used to go through not meditation things but little journeys what was blocking her what were the good things that you wanted to keep well the blocking ones we've got in boxes with change we very little lights we get all sorts of things We watch the bubbles come up until finally they begin to go. Because all they need is good thrashing every so often to get rid of. Where can we go? What can we do? Well, from those blurred images, that's how we see the world, that's how our kids are seeing the world. And I think with our kids, we've got to stop talking about self-esteem and start talking about hope and optimism. These are kids who are seeing the world in a bigger way than we ever saw it because of the news, because of social networking, because of all of those things. And it's not able to be positive. There are some positives, and I know that I'm tending on the negative because they have such an influence. If you look at the news in the first 10 minutes, count up the positives. It won't take much time because they don't put them on that because they know that negatives get our attention. That's where your brain is activated towards because it's about survival. I really don't want to know how many people have been killed in Syria. I don't. It's not my business. Now I'm not saying that I'm rejecting the Syrian people, but I want to look at my own and like those people around me and that type of thing. If I'm living in Syria, a different story. But our kids are seeing this all the time. How much do you talk about hope and optimism and about what you can do? When I travel the world, 99% of people are really nice. And niceness is the same in Kyrgyzstan and Hungary in Sweden and India in Thailand and Singapore in Australia in Fiji these are places that I've all worked in it's always the same the same niceness is there the same values are there the same morals are there but suddenly we see what a Muslim insurgent bomber has done, and we get scared about what Muslim people are doing. I've grown up with both Māori people, that the way that the media keeps talking about, everyone is a radical. And then I go and talk to my mates and they go, we don't believe that? Cow it out, mate. And they go, thank goodness. So our kids are being scared, don't they? As for what they should think about. So I think we need more open optimism actually not only court, but taught in our schools. What else? Well, I don't think that our kids at primary are ready to understand global issues at all because their brain development isn't there. It is not there at all to get your understanding. If I talk to you about Pakistan, unless you've been there, you will not understand what I'm talking about. You will have some views if you have travelled but if you haven't, you're not there. But when are they ready to understand themselves? I think for five errolata. Now I'm going to sew the concept now, I believe that this should be our primary social studies program studying self. And I believe that in secondary be our primary social studies program studying self and I believe that in secondary your social science types program need to continue the process you don't have to accept it so this is what we did it upon it and changed the whole way of thinking changed the whole way of success, changed the whole way of success. Okay, so down in year one to three, I'm talking about their kids understanding, their senses, the need for rest, exercise, hydration, looking at time task management specifically. Like I was talking outside about a teacher who teaches looking to learn and listen to learn. So she takes an art reason with little five-year-olds and she says, who wants to plan a picture like this? She, and she says, who wants to plan a picture like this? She's very good artist. Who wants to paint a picture like this? If you listen to me, you will. And all the kids go, yes. She said, if you listen to me, you will. If you don't listen, you won't go to do it. This is not about painting, this is about listening. Now, if you're listening to me, you're looking at me right now. If you're listening to me now, I need you to take two dabs of brown paint on your brush. If you're listening to me now I need you to take two dabs of brown paint on your brush if you're listening to me now would you please place them there and she models it and these kids over a 20 minute thing they're most amazing poopette and at the end they have reflection she said who liked their painting who thought their painting was just a cool this thing they'd minute and why did you do a good paint? Has a listen? And you see, it's brainwashing, isn't it? But it's opening them up the whole idea, and that's different from somebody who's like, listen to me, put it, pocket on a lot, thank you, eyes this way. That's nothing, that's just big picture stuff. So they're narrowing it down into looking at things. So when they're setting up their junior classroom, some of the tables have photos of the task where they need to get the resources. So not just the task, but that they need to go and get the resources. You can do it in secondly with that. The same time they're practicing, listening and that type of school. I want them to understand their learning preferences, which is things like, what time of day do they work best in? Do they work in middle in little chunks big chunks do they enjoy it better when they're working as a group on their own do they want to move in the dark spaces over here which I can't see yet or do they want to be in the light spaces all of those things there are they self-motivated or do they need somebody to get them along are they tidy are they messy now that's work from done and done, more recently done and Prashnik. Prashnik, she's not Australian, lives in New Zealand, you may have heard that. So I want them to be aware of that. I want them to be aware of their talents, what they do well, and they're old enough to begin to identify it. I want them to understand that self-taught, it will self-result and begin to block this and I choose 52 techniques for guarding the game and for some people they say I like number 18 I like number 32 whatever but they're all different I want them to be aware of what motivates them and there's some really good models about that and we work on one with about four different things I think it's it's not from Cuddy I can't think his name at the moment so we're going around me ahead and I want them to manage choices and I want them to make many mistakes and face the consequences of making that and then readjusting and doing it again and I want them to be aware of how to sit and hence of teaching them the skills and how to manage their stress of your top year six eight and I want them to be aware of how to sit a test of teaching them the skills and how to manage their stressors off. Year 6, 8 and I put plus because I think that these go on. I want them to understand deception and things that we saw like in that photo that what they're seeing in life is not true. That we have different learning styles and we also have different listening styles. We have different feedback styles and it's not putting you in boxes it's saying I'm more of this than I am of that I want them to be up to a set options because to make real choices they've got to be weighing things up I want to manage their self-talk more than just being aware of it stress management is vital we need something about gender communications, don't we? If you're going to understand that girls not only look different, they actually talk different, and so do we as bloat. I want them to understand what success criteria looks like and how to be successful. And I want them to be part of a transition program either into high school or from, I think, year 10 to year 11 or from year 13 into a second year sorry into a job market what do they need to do what are they are to take with okay there you are I haven't finished yet I've got about 10 minutes to go but at this point what does that make sense to you if you've got somebody in your own school that's near you or the better secondary people just chat on your own or chat to another person could you do any of these things is teaching specific skills in practicing could you do it would it make sense why you go check The President someone else you have a lot of the table. And then, be there. We're probably on the other than the case, but for all the ladies. You know, I'm just talking to the attention of it. You know, like, you know, like, you're going to be a bad thing, and then it's going to be able to get a lot. You're about the attention to be. This is a business. You're not like, I have the public attention of the process of a lot of me in the thinking, do I think I hope this discussion which is very rich or do I carry on we've been asked in this five and two parts of me in the thinking, I hold this discussion which is very rich or do I carry on. We've been asked in this five minutes early so that you guys can get to the keynote with my mate Glenn Capelli. He's a really neat guy. Yeah, there's their potential there. I think there is. We proved it. We made changes. Huge changes in self-belief. Huge changes in achievement. Notief, huge changes in achievement, not only academic, sports, cultural, everything else. And behaviour relations just went out the back door. We went from 399 detentions annually down to 1. And our role increased from 389 to 470 in that time. We lost no start in that 10 years due to dissatisfaction, not a single one. We lost some through maternity, some through travel, and some through promotion. That's it. All rest, they did a lot less work. There was a lot bigger smiles. You work too hard, guys. You really do. And it's not going to do you any good. I believe that we can do all of these things through inquiry learning and that we can use technology on the way as a tool because it's not the whole way it's a tool I bet when we first invented drawing on caves we said the same thing well we just hear a whole problem way we can now paint on caves that's really bit it's a good tool let's use it as a tool this is about people we can inquire about self inquire about performance and persistence or look at cognition at means on that type of thing every area is open to study about self some of the things that you would need to do on the way? We've all got about six or seven minutes just because they've finished. It's got to be school why, because otherwise it's so hard to you. because otherwise it's so hard to use. Sridged production techniques, really good for staff, really to work for kids. I think it's going to be linked to maturation, which I've done now. I've linked a learnercy program to key competencies to maturation. If they understand how to motivate themselves, they can make a lot better choices. If they don't know that, they continue to make the same mis-chance. Consequences is the only way that our brain develops content. And yet we often don't give it, we just talk. We need to focus their reticular activating system on what they want, what they want to avoid. Here's an example, whatever you do at the moment, do not see that volcano over there. Don't see that shape looking like Fujiama. Don't see snow on the top. And whatever you do, whatever you do, don't see black smoke coming out of it. Don't see the lava coming down one side running towards that village. And don't see those villages running in panic. Whatever you don't do that. Don't forget your hand with tonight, people. Don't forget I need your money for the trip tomorrow people. Don't forget to say your parents about this. Don't touch this wet paint. Who's ever followed those sides? Hey, you're right. Yeah, cool. Now it's all messed up and I'm going to bring that. We want them to focus on what they want. I used to have locked forwards coming to me and they go to a line out going, I hope they don't throw the board with me because I'll drop it. I hope they don't throw the board to me because I'll drop it. What do they do? When they drew the ball on them? They dropped it. So we want to focus on what we want, to me because I'll drop it. What do they do when they drew the Baltimore? They dropped it. So we want to focus on what we want, not what we want to avoid. We have 16,000 for today. We're in about 40,000 for the same as yesterday. Now I don't know who counts these up. Can you imagine a university student? Do you have a court? Yeah. Is it the same as yesterday? Yeah. Like, second poll. Second call. Same as you said? A different. Yeah. Oh, mate, they deserve the money. We've talked about this one before. This is just an action. You may have seen this. Somebody identified this to me. Listen to the negative self. Yes, quite a good. Oh, man. Do you're wasting. I say something. I'm going to look down in front of the money. I've got in front of my driving. I'm wasting. I'd say something. I'd look down in front of money. I go down in front of money. Money changed your pound. Those precautions. I was doing as his family. Puzzle-Town. And if it dies, your struggle to walk me forever. Where a check? Watch up. You know I'm talking here. Your best chip. Get away. You know I can't carry my best chip. Okay, boy. Speed. Space in. Burr. What are you doing, Barry? I've been internalized in a really complicated situation in my head. What do you know about? I don't think you should drive. Nah. I have two jump free. Is this crazy? Yeah free just crazy yeah scratchy yeah scratchy okay we took the wrist that work therefore our feedback I think needs to change as I'm winding into the end and I'll talk about open opportunity we do this with a particular activating system that's focusing then on what they can do. It's about learning in the next conflict. So we need to ask questions. We avoid, sorry, we ask these ones, but we avoid this one because you can't find an answer. It goes into our amygdala and it looks for sewage to bring back out why do you do that because I'm done because I'm stupid because I'm not as good as I'm because I'm thick because I'm not intelligent I'm clumsy or stupid all of those things there or we can't ask why type questions what made you do that who were you talking to man that's all white type questions why type questions this is they're not specific. Emotional memories? They get us into the fight, freeze or flock type thing there. They're not action based. Whereas these are and we can put them in a sequential order. We can challenge who do you and see what's the next thing? Where would you go? When would you do it? So and so forth. That means that when you you're giving feedback you don't give feedback as teachers you stop and ask it from them because if you give it it's like praise it's like a compliment most new zealanders we reject it and so it's close you might say that about me but I really make believe so I say to you what are you trying to do in this thing here show me the success that you've had there if I say I'm having this conversation with this is a success conversation then I asked him to the next step I want the brain that does the work to do the learning and I also wanted to be positive I want them to be saying it to them now I say say to them, I ask them any questions, I repeat the positive comments or add some more, I talk about the next step and add my comments on it as well. And now I look at your role, my role, our role. What do you have to do? What do you have to do? What do we have? We're into the last lot there. And I've got one minute to finish. Made things in the pictures you can get, isn't it? This is me working out. My wife working out. Now this is supposed to be impossible. But people do it. What's your thoughts? They become your words. What your words? They become your actions. What's your actions because they become a habit? What's your habits, they become character. In other words you. What's your character? It becomes your destiny, your future. A bit of the summer. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much."}
