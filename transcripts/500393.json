I farm in conjunction with my wife on 300 hectares. My name is Hugh Taylor. I farm in conjunction with my wife on 300 hectares of flat land, 60Ks west of Christchurch. At present we're running a trial in conjunction with Lincoln College, the coal tolerance trial and the reason we're doing that is the fact that at lambing time we lose a lot of lambs due to climate or it's due to hereditary factors. We want to identify why we do lose those lambs. It's a huge loss. We're in the game to make profit and when you go out and we find dead lambs, we've got to know the reason why. So this is why the technology is going on. Hi, my name is Tom Broughton and I'm an honest student at Loken University and as part of my research I'm out here on the farm looking at these little guys. So these two, these guys are twins and they're one day old, they were born yesterday. Well it's August here and lambing's just started so we've only had a few but over the next three weeks there's over 850 ewes to lamb. So we're expecting about 1200 lambs at least so it's going to get pretty busy. So the yews are split up into nine or ten different mobs which I go around every day at least twice a day looking for meable niddle lambs like this. Yeah I'm John Hickford, a research scientist at Lincoln University and behind us here we've got a Romney U who's just had one lamb and there's probably a second one on the way in the next quarter of an hour or so. We're studying these sheep here to assess how good they are for breeding, specifically looking at how they pass on genetics that's going to improve lamb survival and lamb growth rate. So second lamp is starting to come out of this year now. You can see its head coming out there now. And this could happen quite quickly. Once the shoulders are through, they tend to come out quite quickly. It's all over in less than a minute usually. It's a good sign to see that movement straight away. That lamb's got life and energy in it. So when they were born, we scoot along next to them and picked them up. We put a little tag in the air and then record that against the mother's number so that later on we can figure out who's who. And we also weigh them and then we put a little blue dot on the back side so that when we that when we're herning around the paddock, we see which ones are already done. So sheep breeding is one of the original human activities in industries. We've been breeding sheep for over 8,000 years, starting out in Central Asia, Iraq, Babylonia. And since that time we've progressed a lot. And with these sheep here, we're using DNA technologies to find the best sheep, find those ones that are going to have the best survival and the best growth rates. And this is a very new technology. It's a technology that's been developed here in New Zealand. And we in fact lead the world with this technology so it's something quite novel and it should improve sheep breeding in New Zealand for the next 10 to 15 years. One of the great things about what I've done and the degree that I've done at Lincoln is it's a really good mixture of practical skills and lots of interesting science. Another good thing is that the agriculture industry is so huge that once I finish there's plenty of opportunities for employment, whether it's working on a farm or as a scientist and everything in between. Well we've come back from the farm, got out of that cold wind, and we've brought with us the DNA that we've collected from the lambs and the sheep up there. We've collected that DNA's drops of blood and it comes in on these cards here. You can see that here, there's drops of blood on a card, tagged to a particular lamb or you. The way we get the DNA out of that is we take a very small hole punch like this. We set it up on a mat and we just punch a little bit of that blood out like that. We put that into one of these very tiny wee tubes like this now and you'll see this going in here. The drop of on the papers gone into the base of that tube there now. Now we've got our DNA on a piece of blood punched out of the card. We give it to the laboratory staff who add some special reagents to create the process called PCR which amplifies up one of the 30, 40,000 genes in sheep so that we can analyze how susceptible to cold these lambs and sheep are going to be. Now we've got the DNA in those tubes with the reagents for PCR. We take them and they go in the PCR machine. This machine changes the temperature of the reagents in the tube, and it's that temperature change, which actually amplifies the pieces of DNA that we need to study inside those tubes. So PCR basically emulates what happens in cells. Cells replicate DNA once. PCR does it millions of times so we get millions of copies of the DNA we're going to study. The DNA is then taken and run in gels and these gels separate out the DNA and allow us to see the different patterns or the different forms of the gene that we're studying in this cold survival work. There's a blue dye run with the DNA that allows us to see exactly where the DNA is at any given time. It's a tracking mechanism. Now we've got the DNA loaded in the gel. We use electricity to separate out the DNA and it separates depending on how large it is into different sized fragments. So once the gels are finished running, we stain up the DNA, and it produces a fairly typical barcode pattern, which we read. We enter that data into the computer, and that information is then sent back to the farmers to tell them which of these sheep actually is going to be the more cold tolerant. So with these technologies we're going to fix up some sheep diseases, we're going to improve lamb survival and it's all happening here at Lincoln University, a small university that's intrinsically involved in farming in New Zealand and around the world."}
