Welcome after a busy night of dancing and letting our hear down a little bit and I just acknowledge everybody that's come along to you in 2013 here in Waikato. Always special to come back and visit this place and settle ourselves beside the beautiful Weikato River and take in all of that wairo and that inspiration. But thank you particularly for coming along and sharing this particular session. It's the graveyard shift, of course. We haggled with the organisers to see we could move. We could get away from the 9 AM on Friday morning shift, but we were very unsuccessful, so we're very thankful that you've appeared this morning. You know, I think with all the cultural responsiveness, Corderville that's been going on, and Mardi student achievement, all those sorts of things and how it impacts in terms of this blended e-learning push and drive. And Bian and I have certainly been working a lot in the Māori medium space, but we've also have a team that work in the mainstream space, so that, you know, whether it's Kura Oaki mainstream schools or Kura Māori. There's obviously different needs, but there's also lots of similarities in the sorts of things that we're hoping to achieve for our kids. So yeah, feel free, feel free to throw questions at us. It's the Kayao de Rangatira, it's all about debate and discussion and just direct all the questions that way. But you know I wanted to just talk a little bit out, not without going into too much about what we've done and what we do, but just the cultural leadership side, because we wanted to sort of talk a little bit about the values and some of those values that we talk a lot about within Māori. And I know that you guys understand a lot of those Māori principles and values, and we'll talk a little bit about that. But my background is very much in terms of leadership. Those of us that are involved in Māori education often have responsibilities, tribal responsibilities. So I'm very involved in a lot of my own kāpapa back there in Taranaki Manga and how it influences the work that I do within education. And so, you know, when I come into places like Waikato, it's really important that we have sort of connect, we make those connections as we do through Porhuri and all those sorts of things. But the next part of that shift and what we really want to talk about today is that leadership in terms of working in the online space and how some of those principles and values of ours are still relevant. And, you know, I think about how we as a Māori team within the call fund, I mean, there's about 35 of us as facilitators when we meet online we're basically still practicing a lot of those things that we do and I want to suggest that that's that's the sorts of things you could be doing within your within your school space around responsiveness you know faikor mehiy those sorts of things can still carry on online so they're not just left on the marai but you know about settling ourselves into certain situations you know of course the sorts of things that you guys are doing in school really digi stories and capturing a lot of information localized story we want to talk a lot about localized curriculum you know if you're here in Waikata obviously you're gonna have a lot of opportunity and you should understand a lot about Waikato obviously you're going to have a lot of opportunity and you should understand a lot about Waikato River and the tribal dynamics of Waikato. So there's a lot of opportunity in the online space to really get into some of that localized Māori history, Khorero, and I'm suggesting that we should be doing that across all of the different places that you're localised your schools in. But that's, you know, that's a little bit, I could talk a little bit about my professional career here at Waikato University which involved a lot of ours in the Hillcrest Heaven. But I won't do that because I showed all my dance moves last night. But you know, my professional career very important but so is also that cultural, that cultural stuff that is starting to blend a little bit more in how we develop that online. Welcome to My World. Taranaki Maunga there in the middle. Apparently it's having a lot of rainfall down in Taranaki today. It's very unusual for Taranaki. We don't get much rain down there, of course. But the reason I just wanted to talk about us as leaders within our tribal communities and the sort of dynamics, you know, eight Taranaki, Iwi, numerous sub-tribes, numerous marae, and the relationships that we're trying to forge with school communities, and school communities are hoping to forge with tribes, with the tribal, and leading some of that charge, and I'm suggesting that you guys are school leaders. You know, you're always wanting to make connection with your marae, with your local hapoo, with your local tribes. And the dynamics that sometimes involved, sometimes that Māori leadership's not always as evident as you would wish. You've got to really get that relationship stuff going. And we certainly have that here in Taranaki. We're a very dynamic in a way and trying to work out who's who in the zoo at times. And, you know, the next part of that is we push into the online space, how we can use a lot of that technology to make connections. When you look at down here in South Taranaki, you're talking around almost into Wanganui, and in South Taranaki, you're talking around almost into Wanganui, in the north Taranaki, around Mokau and into the Mania Puto. So it's quite a big geographical spread. And we're always meeting tribally. It's always good to meet tribally face-to-face. As we know, we prefer it face-to-face contact, we've had opportunity to do over the last couple of days, but you know we're starting to think about tribally about meeting online, Google Hangout and Google Docs and all those, that sort of technology that's taking us a little bit out of our comfort area in terms of tribal relationships. School communities, how we meet online and maintain some of those values. Those are the sorts of things I'm looking forward to talking to you about. Thank you very. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for Keni Thank you for Keni and thank you for being part of this morning for this week of this week of this week I think the word of this we discussion I think the thing that Ken said that really struck me and thank you to being part of this we discussion. I think the thing that Ken said that really struck me and will stay with me for a long time is the way that we, the power of the words, thank you and sincerity that he used when he spoke those words. So thank you for this morning. I'm Dian and I come from the truly really sunny side of New Zealand's and that I come from the East Coast. The opposite side of Fadi's Peace of Land is mine. When we chose the introductory title for the screen, The introductory title for the screen, Leadership in Bicultural Aoteiro in New Zealand, it reminded me of a whole lot of things really. One is that we are a bicultural nature, sorry, if we are to be a bicultural nation, we need to believe in it. We need to believe that two people, and eventually a whole lot more, but two peoples can live in harmony on the same piece of land under similar sets of rules and protocols and parameters. If we are therefore to be a bicultural school or a bicultural community, then teachers, principals and parents and fun of also has to believe that. And we can only believe it that we understand. Sorry, can you hear me at the back? Thank you. We can only believe it if we understand what each other thinks, behaves, and practices, and why. You know that whole thing that Fadi said this morning about welcome to the graveyard shift? I guess if you were to put that into a Māori context, we are born from Papua and we live and we return to Papua. The graveyard takes on a different context. In fact, it's entry to somewhere else. It's only a part of an ongoing cycle. So, well, it's still the graveyard shift. There's nothing wrong with the graveyard shift, except that those that fell into the graveyard last night didn't get up this morning. We'll worry about those ones. Okay, so this is me. This is where I come from. A little wee small place out here, by the name of famous actually, Porangahou. Famous why? Because every Maori television video company stage, dance show, whatever history show, has been to Porangahou to film what happens out there. It's a community of only 300, 400 max, 300 probably permanent residents that quad-truples in the summertime because the beaches are so beautiful. My grandparents were from there, my mum's there still at the moment. I like to take my children, my grandchildren, back and forwards there and their fenua is buried there as well. That will always be home for them. Although I live in Farmerston North and I've been in Farmerston North since my training college days, which wasn't terribly long ago by the way. What is this map? This is map of a group that I'm presently working with, and I want to explore some ideas with you today, that we call Heteratakitani. Now the Crown in its wisdom, I think it's wisdom, many New Zealanders don't, are going through this treaty settlement process, and you'll know that there are rednecks in the community that say, no matter what you do, you can give them all the money in the world, and they still won't get it right. But Iwi, the people, want to get it right. And from where I'm sitting, this is a way to redress some of those ills. It won't. Fix all the problems of the world. But for our particular group, we're going to invest. We want to invest in education. Education is the building block of moving people into the future. Education that is determined by us is what that looks like. Here's a curriculum. Here's the local part of that. Here's the Iwi part of that. What is it that we want our children to be able to do? Oh, turn it on my top. And so this is my thinking around what that could look like. In the very centre are our kids. Now I'm not just talking about Māori children. I'm talking about all the kids that live in this tribal area that I'm working in, that I call home. The reality is that most of the Māori children are in the Decile 1 and 2 schools up there in Napier Hastings and all the way along this coastal area. Low desal schools but in wonderful, wonderful communities, communities that believe in their kids. And so you have those children in their centre in the learning. There may well be a learning space where all these things happen. There's a Punalreau, there's an early year centre of some sort. Kota Tuatahe, primary, secondary where all of you come into, a place where tertiary students, who may be part of the EIT, Masi, Weikato and established Wananga, still do their studies, but they've partnership up with the Iwi provider. And so that could be a place where those students come back and learn about their own home. Learn about what we as on the way out of the cycle believe is important for our people to move forward. The key part and the bit that I'm really, really, really excited about is down here in the bottom corner. Every marae in the whole region is set up with really good broadband UFB access and it's connected back to this learning centre. Now that means that the people, people like my mother and my aunties, can carry on their education learning about whatever it is they want to learn about from home without having, because my mum's close to 80 now, she's an ex-school principal. She's the first one to say there's so many things I haven't yet learnt. We have conversations and we're talking different languages. When she was a principal, the world was different. She didn't have been retired for 20 years and there's been so many changes. So too old to get in the car and drive to Napier, but not too old to get in the car and drive three days up the road, pick up her sisters and engage in some online bell classes by being able to connect back to the learning centre. The other key part down the bottom is the strategic partnerships that an Ie make with people that are already out there and committed. So it might be, for example, builders. You go and build me a site, company A. You go and build me a new school with all those things in it. I'll give you the contract in an exchange. I want you to give me 10 apprenticeships for the next 10 years. Or whatever. Something like that. Established providers, the Wananga, the schools, the partnership based on knowing that, if we get it right, everybody here benefits. Not just the every,, everybody here benefits. Not just the ewee, but everybody here benefits. The interesting part of this is that that's only part of what we call our ewe. Nati Kahananu comes, extends from almost to Gizzy, all the way down to Wellington on the East Coast, and actually pops over the water a little bit too in patches. But the crown, because it's such a large area, thousands, thousands of people, coast and actually pops over the water a little bit too in patches. But the crown, because it's such a large area, thousands, thousands, thousands of people, had determined that this area shall be called heretonga tamataia. And so it's this area that we're talking about. And we're talking about a hundred and twenty million dollar plus settlement. Now I could do a whole lot of things with that. I could throw it in a pot and have one heck of a party or I could give five million dollars to all of our 25 marae. But you're really going to ask what's the long-term future in that? You invest in our people and our kids, there's likely to be sustainability. What does the investment look like? This is what I want my mokopuna, and the next ones and the next generations to know, to do, to be able to practice. First and foremost, I let my children swim in the Manor two river. There is no way I would let my grandchildren swim in the Manawatu River. In a generation, half a generation really, the Manoru River has become one of the world's duties, most polluters. To have the everyday schools with every day skills where they can make choices about their life. Things as simple as changing a light bulb, swapping the tire on a car. The things that our parents taught us just to survive. I can change a tire on my car. I'd rather stand on the side of the street in a lot, but actually changing the time, doing it myself as a basket. The basics of living. Being out of two, balance your checkbook and make a decision, if you've only got $50 left this week, shall I spend it on food or shall I go and have an eye to the casino? Making those sort of decisions and a collaborative sort of way to benefit as kids and families. The ongoing care for the opportunity. And she sustains us, so too must have been back. We've got to stop taking it out and you're no repairs. Hearing for themselves and caring for others. The whole concept of Fano is the key building block in Māori society. And it's funny we'll talk through later, online space doesn't take that apart. It has the potential to pull it together and make it stronger. Bilingualism. I absolutely believe in Bilingual New Zealand. I know very much that I'm willing to see Bilingual New Zealand in my life. I love to you know that one. Multilingualism, bilingualism, you get two views of the world, two ways of hearing your message and your thoughts, two cultures in which you can integrate. Then you'd double that by learning salmon and Pukai Lamauddin, the whole world. And then the Asian languages, and so forth and so. But as you know, much as we'd like to, we can sit here in New Zealand by ourselves for the rest of our lives in the bottom of the world. And so a multilingual group of children that first and foremost understand who they are and who our partners are in our family. Well, that was a passion to start. are in our hand. Well, that was a passion to start. Oh, just before I hand over, sorry. All of us the teachers will know about this, best evidence of simplest, and what it says about leadership in schools. We want to take you a little bit beyond that, leadership in schools and their communities. Because the day you first put your hand up and said, I want to go to teachers college, I want to be a teacher, you put your hand up as a leader of other people. And so this evidence says that there are a number of things that we need to focus on, raising achievement and reducing disparity for all students. I'm not statistics to the side, I'm not totally convinced that we do this as well as we could do. We're focusing on Māori students, priority learners, but you know every time another group of refugees comes from New Zealand, comes to New Zealand, they bring another set of language, culture and identity, which as teachers we need to work through. Second one is focusing on Māori students and that's about the bringing up two people, two sets of kids and two sets of cultures, to an even playing field. If for example you decided in your school that you wanted all your children to speak Māori well fluently conversationally what you would have to do is take away their first language which is English take it out of the picture completely and focus on a target language if you want to do this then and this is the bit that's controversial around the country, you need to reduce what's happening for some children, not make it ugly or figured about them or anything like that, but totally focus on how you're going to do this, how you're going to lift this up. To the point where they are performing, all the kids in your school are performing academically and socially at the same level. Now you know as well as I do that anything in New Zealand where it is money in particular that's given to a group of Māori is contentious. Māori all blacks is contentious. Māori education funding is contentious, Māori resourcing. Because people perceive it as exclusive, excluding non-Maudi, but it's not. It's trying to bring those balances back into place. And actually, I bet you didn't know this, a lot of the money that goes into Kipaf Māori education comes from unclaimed monies in Māori land, in historical Māori land. I don't know where the Obelix money comes from. Actually, I don't really care of that much. To strengthen the values, our social values within our schools. And my big question is here, is the teacher's values the same as the student values? Are we on the same thinking about what's good behaviour, what's right, what we should do, what we shouldn't do? Because if we're not, there's some work to do there. And a big one for all of us, and it's ongoing for years and years and years, to grow sufficient, effective and efficient leaders. And each and every one of you in this room is a leader. And each and every one of you in this room is a leader. Kilda? So the expectations aren't so big are they? You know, the leadership stuff is important to all of us. And as well, in the cultural side, you guys are school leaders. I mean, also in the online space. And, you know, maybe we need to, as we sort of move to think about the online space and what you're doing is school leaders. And I know we're having it. We have some debate, I suppose, within Māori medium schools at times as to as the school leaders because often the school leaders are the holders of all potential within schools and it's no different in our Māori medium schools with some of our leadership we're having to challenge them on the online space to to make things happen. You know, PLD support, you know, I just want to acknowledge those of, you know, those of you know, those of you that have come here as whole staff, Ricky and you're talking about a new crew, you know, come here as a staff into a big conference like this and you're going to take all that knowledge back as a staff. And we've got a kuda from my little hometown of New Plymouth, Tua Hewaiwai, Fraser College, Fraser High, you know, that have come as big groups of staff because the leadership of buying in to this online blended e-learning, these opportunities. And so, you know, it's a bit, you know, the hard, you know, just real basic stuff around good, good solid hardware to really make all of this happen. And, of course, the resourcing, you know, making, I know it's, it's an expensive exercise to come into something like this and then to resource your schools. And so it's a real challenge. No doubt the challenges are similar in mainstream schools as they are in Kura Māori, in Māori medium schools. In fact, some of our challenges are a little bit different because we're dealing with a lot of that cultural stuff. There's still a school of leadership within Māori medium that really think everything should still be face-to-face. And that's one of our challenges. So, you know, you can allow things to happen or not. You know, we are at a hui-a-learning hui in Wellington, with about 60-od of our Māori medium colleagues. I've had a really good team there, had just some really good interaction, and a lot of our facilitator, our core Māori facilitators, and I know some of you attended some of our workshops, Nicole's workshops, Janelle, Riki, some of you may have got along to those sorts of things. They ran those sorts of workshops and, you know, look at these two, these two Koro's on the right, that, you know, they've been teaching, they've been in the teaching game for a little while. And, you know, just the whole, to start playing with the iPad was a bit of a challenge. And so, you know, I mean, we're all having those challenges. In fact, you know, the likes of Nicole of my team, they're always dragging me into new little toys and new little gadgets. And when we think about it as, you know, we all know the stories about mawi tiki-tikiya, you know, he's Ruekea, he's a tutu. He's a tutu there's little you know all those little maori boys in your classroom they're always don't touch say they go and touch that's mawi and that's the sort of mindset we just need to get into when we're playing with things even if you delete everything you've been working on for the last couple of hours but you know i know, this Koroiki is from this one of the glasses, from Rua Tahuna. Right, you know, but there's no reason. Fast broadband is going to be here tomorrow. So they will have as good access in those real rural areas as we will have in the middle of Hamilton or Auckland. And so that's all available. He did pretty well after three days that old fella. I know I know we've, have you been to some of our workshops before, we talk a lot about the values, our values. You know, this coup we throw around, our ownungatanga, our community, our relationships within schools, just amongst ourselves as staff, as amongst ourselves with our parents and our kids, and our wider community, and our tribal community. You know, we've got just so much opportunity on this online space. It just doesn't, you know, Kānohi, Kita Kānoi's always going to be important, no doubt about it. But when you can have online hui and be running on ongoing Google Docs to, you know, just cover things off. We don't always have to come together around the table. We can really, we can do a lot of our work online. So, you know, those are the sorts of wera, I suppose, we're putting out there to our school communities. For Naungatanga's alive and well online. You know, I've got a lovely 80-year-old queer back home and she's become a Facebook queen. You know, and she's, she has discovered it over the last year and of course, you know, she's got 30-odmokal. And so she's connecting up with them all over, you know, and I see a lot of people still on Facebook when I came past computers over the last couple of days. Not me though. But it's that connection, that Wanoongatanga. And apart from everything else, the Twitter's been going crazy, of course, the Tihau. So, you know, I think that we can play that Wanoonga Tanga stuff out and we are. And it's, and it's positive it's connecting us as Māori people are certainly doing a lot work you know we're really buying into that sort of that technology so when I'm a tanga karehara to I'm um they were kupura you know just the only reason I'm chucking kupu up is a lot of it is how we treat each other online. When we think about sometimes our tamariki how they treat each other, and we're just suggesting here that those, we, you know, it's really only, I think it's still only a small percentage that, that do that bully stuff online. You know, if you're a bully off, you're, if you're a bully, you're going to be a bully online or offline. But what we should be talking to our kids about is how well we treat each other, not just in the online environment, but how we just treat each other as caring people, as compassionate people. And, you know, sometimes when I see, you know, even with my own tamariki, how they talk to each other when they're texting, when I steal my daughter's phone and check out who she's talking to. You know, just that we should be thinking about those values and how we play them out because they're no different to how we sort of treat each other place to place. That's all I'm saying in terms of arrova. Manakitanga anone, you know, it could be just a little mihi at the start of an email rather than straight into the business can sort of set that scene of a caring, nurturing sort of relationship. And that's the sorts of things I think we should be going to. You've all got mana'a and aroha somewhere in your mission statement. It's there. I've seen so many charters and things over the years and they're always talking. You know, all schools are buying into those. So how do we play that out on the online space? And making sure that those sorts of values are played out and that we treat each other well? You know, the toho of the Rangatira, he's not just about having a big feed. That's how we care and treat each other. Um, the Tuakana Taina, the mahi, you know, I, we talk a lot about that in education and, you know, I think as I say with my team, all these tohunga down here, see, Nicole's probably tweeting something about what I'm saying. But they, you know what I'm saying. But they, you know, I'm quite happy to, even though I may have some sort of managerial role, which, as Ricky said, you may be the boss, but that doesn't really mean much. You know, they become the Tuakana in the space. And that's, you know, we just have to play that out. And we're, you know, we're talking about our tamariki, you know, co-constructing stuff with our tamariqi, that online space is, we don't all have to, the kids don't all have to do the same project. My son is at a school in South, in Taranaki. He's come out of a kura and he's gone to the other side. He's gone into a Catholic boy school in New Plymouth, Francis Douglas. I'm a Catholic boy, as you could tell. You could tell, by the the way I drank last night. But I, you know, he came home with this assignment, research assignment and it was about pirates. I said, do you want to do pirates? He's year seven. Yeah, I don't know. But you know what, this online space, they don't just have to all research the same thing. And we've got the opportunity now to the kids to actually go into context and do things that they want to do, not just always do the same stuff. And that's the challenge out there for us as Kaya'a'a-a-a-a-haw. So that mahi-gha, letting the kids drive a little bit co-constructing, but do we actually make it happen? And I think that Tuokana, where the kids can actually be the Tuokana and things that are good at. And the teacher can take a backward step. You're a facilitator, you are not the knower of all knowledge. Tuakana, our relationships with our kids and their families. And even in the Māori sort of space, we're great at pulling the weavers in or the good kappa-haka people. We're great at bringing those in to the space and that's the sorts of things we should be doing. Yeah. The last one about Tuakana Taina is a bit of an example about how over time, takanga and values and practices change. Traditionally, Tuakana Teina was a tribal thing based on Fakopa. So I have Tuakana that are younger than me, considerably by many years, because their mother is older than my mother. Whereas in the school context, it often works out to be age-driven. The older children read with the younger children. But it doesn't have to be like that. Some kids are Tuakana at arts, but teina at reading. Tuakana on the sports field, teina at maths. And so all those relationships are perfectly fine, irregardless of the children's age. Moving on. And thinking again about both the physical space and the digital space and what we do with our words. I believe the minister calls it plain English reporting to parents. Now the words that you see up there behind you are words that I've collected from my own grandchildren's written reports since plain English reporting became a trendy term to use. Can upload, store and retrieve essential information? What does that mean? Realistically to a parent that whose only exposure to the e-learning world is via Facebook upload store and retrieve. Cognitively challenging. So that's just a little reminder that we threw in there to think about the language that you use. Because you think about it when you're working with children, but we also need to think about it when we're working with children, but we also need to think about it when we're working with parents-far-no community. Anybody that recognises this picture must be around about the same age as me. As a youngster, as a, I must have been 1213 or so. I adored, absolutely adored this program. I loved it. Why did I love it? Because it was so out of my realm of what was possible in my world. In the community where I grew up, we had two ways of getting to school. One on your feet or two on the back of your mate's horse. To think about travelling in a little space shuttle, space jet up in the air, was really out of, it was, you just couldn't do it. Once in your life you could go on an aeroplane. But this was, and the other part of the Jetsons that I really remember was that she used to push a button on the wall and the meal would fall out. And they'd just pick up their meal on their escalator, walk, a travelator thing. And it was right. In the paper, just online just last week, I found this picture. Here we are in 2013, and this is in Tel Aviv. And it's a picture of a personal family people mover. So that the issue of course is congestion in the city, and this is the solution, it's called the SkyTrain. It's still being tested and trialled and played with, but it will take people from one venue to another venue to prevent you way up there. Now that's in my lifetime. So I struggle to think about what my grandkids will be doing and seeing in their lifetime. Because I love pushing the button on the microwave when out pops the dinner all ready to roll as well. Thank you. Thank you. I'll pretty much talk about that, just the online space and, you know, encouraging our students to treat each other well online. And actually, you know, when you think about it, I think, you know, a large percentage of our kids do. You know, they do, they tend to treat each other well as they do out in the playground. It's just that small percentage. Sometimes we're spending, I find that we're spending a lot of time talking about safety things around being online. And sometimes we should just acknowledge that a lot of our kids do, you know, they are good. They do treat people well. And not all of them are getting hassled. That is something we need to be concerned about. You know, talking to them about, you know, if they're writing stuff, whether it's Facebook or blogging or whatever, you know, would they like their parents or grandparents to read that stuff? You know, would they like, would, you know, I'm going to talk about my 80-year-old auntie on Facebook and, you know, one of my cousin bros was on there swearing about this and I think it might have been a state of origin game or something and his, his queer came over top of him with a comment to say, you know, Iro-I-Tereo and Terel Māori about swearing online. And he got a nice little telling off online, just like we used to when we used to go running through the meeting house and the old queer would stand up there and yell at us. But he got a nice, and he came back immediately, so, Iroha, my auntie. So, you know, it goes out there. And sometimes, you know, the sorts of things were, the point I'm trying to make is we don't have to hammer them all the time with the safety stuff. You know, kids got to work it out sometimes themselves, but it's handy to have an 80-year-old, auntie, looking over you. You know, all the little, the sort of text messaging language, and we're getting the OMGs and the WTFs and all that sort of, that sort of language that, you know, my mother still hasn't quite worked out what they mean, but, you know, it's relevant to be talking to our kids about whether we should be using that or the sort of context. And we can't talk about how they talk to each other amongst their peers. It's a bit harder, especially when it comes to texting, but certainly on that open line space. And we want to encourage them to be using, to be blogging, and I'll talk a little bit about that later on. What? What? What? That sucks. What did he do? He you going to do? No way teachers can't hurt kids, he should get fired. Did you tell your mum? Yep, she's going to go over some and jump on the feet. Nah, she just laughed. She told me to get over it. Yeah, my dad's real mad. She told me to harden her. I saw this conversation online. How did I see it? My granddaughter logged into her Facebook chatting thing through my iPad, and she got to log out. So when I went on to Facebook, her chat group popped up. She doesn't live at my house, but she just thinks she did. And this was the first page that you saw was the conversation. And I sat there as a responsible adult, and I thought, what should I do about this Mr Mac did it? I'm hurt and the teacher did it. So I was going down at school next day anyway and I mentioned it to Mr Mac and I said, look, there's nothing in here because the one that said, my mum told me to hard enough, was actually the right how this conversation finished. I said to Mac, this is what happened, this is what it looks like. That brought in the principal and a couple of other teachers, and we were having discussion on the playground about what the school's action should be as a result of this. One said, Mr Mac needed to bring the parents of the children engaged in this conversation, not to growl, but just to let them know that what was going on. Another one said, actually it's none of our business because it was a private conversation between kids. And a third one said, well, hang on a minute, I thought there was an age of it on Facebook if these children are nine. If the parents have agreed that their children have Facebook page, then they are responsible for what goes on online. So a whole range of different comments. But the point that we want them to make here is that one or three, if they have been the response, could have blown up into something quite different. And actually, kids need to understand that if you're going to have silly, silly things to each other, do you get a giant, do you know? Don't leave it there for when you need to have a look at when she gets on their best of it. As it turned out, just incidentally the child the original child investigator had logged on through her school, log on, not her private one and so that issue was dealt with between school and parents and her icon had her sitting't a school beautiful too. Now this is an interesting discussion. It's that's beginning to pop its head around as our kids get more savvy, as their access to global knowledge becomes easier. And actually, as they change as a result of being digital learners, their behaviours change, the way they learn, how they learn, and your role as a teacher all changes. And so this is a conversation really for you to think about and what do we need to provide to enable these children to learn. If you go back to my original plan about the big picture, what does an Iwi role look like, what that plan enables is 24-7 learning. Across all generations, across all venues and across all languages and learning context. So actually the context is probably not all that important anymore. It's what we do with the material that the children are accessing. The learner is accessing. Last year, Fari and I were privileged to spend about 10 days over in Australia and we visited a special school in just out of surface paradise. They had this amazing space in there and they called it the snoozy slewisily. It was a combination of clothes, music, bedding, what else was in there, fairly sensory things, and the kids could just go into the space any time really they needed a bit of a midi-mitty or with these particular children when they were not quite in a space that was conducive to any sort of learning and they needed a pick-me-up. And it was almost like a blue cave that felt, sounded, smelt really, really good. I thought that was a great one actually. And so it raises the question of where are our kids going? What sort of learners will they be as adults? And I guess the biggest challenge of all for teachers is how do you get them there? I guess the writer, the inventor of the Jetsons, I hope he made one heck of a fortune in his lifetime. Because he got it right but how do we know now same question as in 20 years ago how do we know now where we're going and therefore what's what we need to prepare our children for our schools eventually will be all sorts of they all are actually they are really not be all sorts of, they all, actually they are really, aren't they, all sorts of different shapes, sizes, backgrounds, values, colours, needs, aspirations, experiences and so on and so on and so forth. Maybe the best advice is, Kea Khaara, Kaiaikaika, Ma. And when you work through that challenge, just remember that whoever Mr Jetson was, he did, is, Kea Kaka'a kaiapu ma. And when you worked through that challenge, just remember that whoever Mr Jetson was, he did it. Nicole, you're way too young for that. So anybody want to bang out the Jetson theme song? Nicole, we're way too young for that. Look, we're not going to take much more time, we've only got a little bit to go through, but I just wanted, we just wanted to think about the gaming, the whole gaming stuff that's happening with our kids. I'm doing a little project at the moment around engaging Māori boys because we're so lovely and of course engaging our boys through technology and there's a lot of exciting things happening so watch the space because I think there's going to be a little bit more push on the online space. But you know as we know, you guys have heard from the keynote speakers around gaming and those of you that follow TEDx and all those sorts of things that talk about gaming and the actual skills that our kids are learning. I mean, you know, I was a real anti-gamer. You know, I can remember going home one time. I've got two sons in their 20s now and they were, they had, I'd come home one afternoon, a beautiful summer's day and snuck in their house and they'd had the, they had were, they had, I'd come home one afternoon, a beautiful summer's day, and snuck in the house and they had the, they had the house closed down and they were inside playing cricket on one of those X-boxes and I was, I opened the curtains and said, guys, there's a cricket pitch over the road, you know, go and play cricket. But, you know, in fact, I've sort of got over myself a bit and started to get my backslide work playing basketball with my son the other night. But, you know, obviously there's a lot of learning in that, and it's just how we transfer some of that skill into their, into engaging our kids online. I'm doing some, you know, little, just that's that relationship thing, of course, with our boys. But, you know, trying to adapt some of that skill that they're learning that. You know, all the curriculum areas are in one game, of course. But, you know, how can we sort of encourage our boys? Not just through the gaming stuff, but there's a lot of good apps out here. I thought I'd chuck this one at you for a bit of a look. It's a bit of a... this very cool young man. But he's... Sorry, guys. See what he's got to say. I like to play online, because I love stuff. I love games. I like to play sports, car games. It's really fun and I need stuff online about school work but how many people in the country, what's their favourite food, what kind of sports they're good at, and how big it in the country is, how people are in there. And I love my sports, it's really good, I like to watch the highlights. It's really cool because I get to see my favourite players play on TV all the fun that I can watch it online. I like to watch tries, tackles. I think, yeah. Part of it is, you know, just finding out what spins the kids' wheels at times. I mean, he actually likes sports. But, you know, finding out what turns them on. And that is my son. He hates reading and he hates writing. So with his mother and I have got him on to a blog where we just get it, let him write and let him talk about the things that he's really interested in. And, you know, I mean, I'm sure you guys are doing all sorts of things like that with the online space. You know, I'm really excited that he's making lots of mistakes and all that sort of stuff, but just getting down and putting stringing five or six sentences together for a start and trying to build on it. And as you know, good teachers you are commenting, you know, when mum and dad make a comment and he starts to puff his chest out a bit as he does. So, you know, those sorts of things are exciting and I'm sure you're doing those, all of that. The apps, you know, Te reo Māori, and here's the app queen down here. Nicole, you know, just in terms of what's out there in the Te Reo Māori app space. You know, we're not far from being able to just sort of point your smartphone at a maunga and it'll, all the peepi half of that maunga will drop down and all that sort of stuff that's out there. So we're really excited about the Te-Reo-Mari space and what we can actually do in terms of growing our language. And, you know, I do want to say, Te-Reo-Mauri to Aurae, ma'u'a, ma'u'a Aurae, that Te Reo Māori thing is not just about us. You know, we've got that vision of a bilingual country and that we want you to come on a journey, your own personal little reo journey. You know, we don't expect you to get up there in faikor and koreo and kharanga and waiata, all our weaata, but, you know, just to have your own conversational reel. There's apps out there. You can recordero and kharanga and waiata, all our wayata, but you know, just to have your own conversation all real. There's apps out there. You can record yourself and check out your beautiful pronunciation. And of course, the education apps. You guys have all been to heaps of workshops, and there's so many out there I get dizzy. But, you know, we're doing some exciting things with Pick College and Comic Life because we can record, we can make stories, photo booth and, you know, all of those things that you guys are familiar with and we can actually adapt to real in there. So, you know, we're that, ha, ha, ma. In ton of moutunga, you know, even though we're big on the online space, we also think that this is pretty important too. Okay, so I mean, that's a fika-a-mutunga tera. You know, it's, we can, you can record and capture all of that imagery right outside your front door, and it's all that localized stuff. But, you know, remember it's all that localized stuff but you know remember it's it's right there for us if we've we've got a bit of time and we've talked at you for an hour we've got an opportunity of you if you're interested in asking some questions or if you're like me needing a long black I understand but we're just wishing you all the best but please fire away some questions and they will respond Georda if I fattai importance for Māori And the transition in the 21st century learning. Importance for Māori being face to face, we all know about that. Is it able to transition or is it already transitioning into Skype and video comments in the same way? And if we go with the Jetsons theme, is it going to work with 3D holographic projections? And also considering that we're already seeing Tangi Hunab being webcasts to our Fano in Australia so that they can participate in like you be there. What are the implications of Kanawi Karnovi Knawi Knawi in a 21st century learning environment? It's one of those cases where you put, I suppose you put what's in your heart alongside to what's reality and make the best call for the situation. There is absolutely no doubt that your face should be seen at that event or at that you need for connecting with your caro. But the reality of 21st century living is that, A, we must go to work because we have to survive. Circumstances change and actually some of us work from four in the morning until four o'clock the next morning because we are 24-7 accessible. No matter where you are, somebody get, so there's all those sort of things waved up with what's in your heart really. I know that for me personally, I will go and put my kānoggi in that space as much as I possibly can. At other times I know that I can't. On the positive side, through Facebook, I'm speaking a lot more time conversing with my relations than I ever did before Facebook, a lot more time and able to keep touch where they are and what they're doing and how many kids have got, what those kids are up to. So you go away and up, really. Yeah. and what they're doing and how many kids have got what those kids are up to so you go the way it up really yeah um I mean that's a debate that's out there at the moment around that can't really keep down you know I don't think Kaini Kinau Kita and it's value within our society and in fact just as people will ever ever diminish and be on my space. I really don't. It's always a preference. As you learn, it's proven, you know, we're getting together and meeting in this way, it's always going to be a preference. In terms of the tribal stuff, you know, I went to a Peking Hungar at home just recently and I had a couple of live pads in my faces. I was doing my little flashed meeting to my Fiona that was lying there and I could see a couple of cousins that in my faces. I was doing my ring flashing me, because my phenyana that was lying there, and I could see a couple of cousins that were at place over in Perth. They couldn't be back from the Port-Poor Waki Ma. And they wanted to be a part of it. And why should we use that technology? That will never take place, take the place of Khaunee, Kitta, and the importance of that. Of course, we had a few of my traditional relations say we should not be doing that and we had all that debate too, but you know, Tami Han is all about debate and putting your Fikar, which is worth down on the No Morai. And that's how I see. I like to question. Okay, boy, wasn't going to bring the singer away or we're going to get some things. Before we finish off, we go back to that very first screen in the title of this, bicultural, Al Tooro in New Zealand. And our leadership within that. One of the really important things to Māori is the Flewai. You know, the Khorreda was around the funeral is so big, you would never get it in a whole new one day, we're still going today. But it's so important that it is the thing that connects non-waiute teachers to those kids and their faunae. And Fadis talked about different apps that you can see what the stars are outside your part of the Fenua. We can download the information for every native forest and its trees, its children, insects and its birds, in your past of the country, and the river and the fish, that in your part of the country. It's all we call Localised Criplum. If we know that the trees, the birds, the forests, the insects, the insects, the land, the air, the water, are really important to Māori. There's a whole Gaelicrypm in there. Science, maths, language, outdoor investigations, exploratory. You could go on and on and on and on without moving pretty much more than a K or two outside your school door. And I think if you go away from here today with one thing, it's a thought about how am I going to localise my school curriculum so that every child can firmly plant their feet in their own land and say, this is where we're from. This is where we identify. You know, some kids love their school. They are so proud to wear their school uniform in the community, in the sports field, on the choir stage, in a range of different places. And some kids actually do even think they possibly can not to be identified with their school. And if you've got kids in your school that are in that second choice, then you've got some hard questions to ask yourself. Valuing and acknowledging, not necessarily understanding, but valuing and acknowledging the children's native language. English, Maori and first instance, sign language and other languages as they apply to your school. Valuing, acknowledging and practicing, with your heart in the right place, the children's culture. And understanding, like your question, how that's, how the e-learning space, how the digital space impacts on that culture, and actually having those conversations with Fano. These kids would like to participate in this. We can't afford to take a bus to take them from age. having those conversations with Fano. These kids would like to participate in this. We can't afford to take a bus to take them from age and we to do that. How do you feel if we've participated online? And language, identity, culture. Identity is about who you are when you belong. Where you come from? What's the place that makes your heart go boom, bong, bong, bong. For me there's only one place in the entire world. Quite, very, quite recently, very quite recently, my little blonde grandson came home with a piece of work that he had done at school. But I was very proud of it. I thought, I would congratulate the school about it he's only seven the story went for Ilead Tho my name is Roe now I congratulate for father Donaqi thought of mama nor papayoya ahu I am from Palmerston, North. Now I congratulated the school on the first three lines. It scolded them, nicely, but scolded them on the last line. As you remember on my map, I am not from Pa'aioya Parmiston North. So I'm not, he's not. You might be blonde, you might have your eyes, and you might live in Patmas and not. But it's not who the child is. It's the way his family, his family look at him. So there's a wee hint for you to take away too. When you're using that in the head-peer-house structure, children that identify, either they identify themselves or their parents identify them as malady, is I'm talking to go take an English way of looking in the world and put it on another cultural structure and expect to get the same results. Thus we said that I would talk about is that somebody mentioned breathing before this whole move around learning language. I think 25 years ago, when Tadeu Māori was in a devastating almost extinct state, people were very precious, anxious, hurt, and a whole little other emotions, if somebody said, Altya Rower, and yes, there were a fierce few slaps people given 25 years ago. Today in 2013, things are not quite so tense. There are more people speaking the language. And publicly, there's television, there's broadcasting, there's all sorts of things going on. Even hats off to TV tree in My Language Week, they were amazing. And some of that then continued on. You watch the weather and you get Tamaki Makoto, all kinds. So the language is not quite in such a dire state and people like myself and others like me are not going around sleeping you because you say Al-Tiroa. But encouraging you to say Al-Tirua. And so no matter what you feel about, give it a go. Give it a go. Because the future for all of us, as teachers, as New Zealanders, is by course of it. Last question? My at my way out of course of Kosovo. I'm going to our koretti and enjoy the rest of the conference. I'm in the oonging of one, and enjoy the rest of the conference. I'm so looking forward to add seven to myself, enjoy the rest of the conference, safe travels home, and thank you once again for your ten years at a second. Thank you."}
