The Defence Force plane, the delegation, had been travelling on, has broken down in Washington, D.C. The PM was already intending on flying home commercially, but it means another change of plans for the rest of the delegation. Meanwhile, the delegation are also currently awaiting the results of a fresh round of COVID tests. It comes after two of Jacinda Adirn's top officials tested positive on Monday, forcing them to isolate in San Francisco. The rest of the delegation have touched down in Washington, where Adirn will meet with the US President Joe Biden tomorrow morning. Supermarkets have been told they need to change at pace or face tougher regulations as the government moves to increase competition. They now have to open their wholesale arms to smaller competitors, label products with unit pricing and work via code of conduct to give supplies bargaining power. But AUT Senior Research Fellow Richard Mead told NewsHub late, the plan is just a highly reactive approach to the cost of living crisis that will see little shopper benefit in the short term. I think they could actually frustrate that because they are potentially going to stop the process of competition unfolding as it already is with Costco entering Yorkman market. The government, I guess, is anxious to be seen to be doing something about it, but these measures aren't going to do anything short-term. A new supermarket watchdog will review supermarket's compliance of the new regulations annually. Tonga is the next target for a delegation from China that has been shoring up deals with nations right across the Pacific. China was hoping to secure a region-wide economic deal with multiple Pacific countries, but several island nations have now expressed concerns. The delegation signed an agreement with leaders from Fiji on Monday following meetings with Samoa and an earlier deal with the Solomon Islands. China is seeking to reshape the regional order and provide support on everything from policing to fisheries. Efforts to establish a Europe-wide ban on Russian oil have failed. EU members have met in Brussels to negotiate its toughest Russian sanction yet, a complete embargo on Russian oil. Amidst impassioned pleas from many member states, Hungary has refused to approve the plan. Talking to media, the Hungarian Prime Minister fought back claims. He's Putin's puppet. Now out of blue, we have got the idea of embargo and sanctions on oil without answering the questions which related to the Hungary and energy supply security. So the whole situation we are in is a difficult one the lack of consensus has caused significant divisions between EU members with Latvia calling those opposing the ban selfish if each European country only thinks about itself then we would never move forward Latvia is very heavily dependent has been on Russian energy imports. We are moving away from that and have no problem with that. It's going to cost us more, but it's only money. 21 bodies have been recovered following a plane crash in Nepal. Four Indian and two German nationals are among the dead. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane during a 20-minute flight. Search operations have been hampered by bad weather and mountainous terrain. One passenger is still missing. In sport, the central pulse of shot to the top of the A&Z premiership with a hard-fought 51 to 43 win over the tactics. A big defensive effort from co-captain Kelly Jury ensured the Pulse retained a one-goal lead, hanging into the final quarter. The visitors then pulled clear of the tactics to claim their ninth win of the year, which saw them overtake the Northern Mystics on the ladder on goal percentage. The Chelsea Football Club has officially been sold with a consortium led by American investor Todd Bowley completing the deal. Chelsea was put up for sale in March after previous owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned due to his links with the Russian president. In a statement Bowley said he was honoured and wanted to make fans proud as he secured the future of the club. The consortium bought the club for $8.2 billion. The proceeds of the sale will be donated to charities supporting victims of the war in Ukraine. Let's take a look now at your weather for Tuesday. The weather brought you by nature.

Well, it's the last day of the dairy season, and farmers who are moving on to new properties will be gearing up to make the shift. They'll be packing up the Massey Ferguson. But how are things looking for the new season ahead here to help us wrap up the dairy season? Is Ag First Managing Director James Allen. Morena, to you, James? Good morning, Bernie. Moving day, probably more like moving week. Can you give us an explainer on what it is? Sure. Well, we call it moving week because really this is the last day of the dairy season today. And 1st of June is the start of next year. So we use 1st of June. Nearly all of the year. So we use 1st of June. Nearly all of the cows are dried off, and it's a chance to reset, and it's traditionally a little bit quieter at this time of year. So this is the reason most farm jobs do change at this time of year. However, times are moving, so for farm staff, you don't have to wait until 1st of June to shift anymore. So it's a chance for people to change leases on farms, to buy new farms, to new share milk and gigs. Is that the setup? That's right. If you're buying or selling a farm, you're leasing a farm, or you're a share milk and moving to a new property, it makes sense for everyone to try and shift at this time of year. So there's a little bit of coordination in the industry. It also makes it a pretty busy time. There'll be a lot of farmers out there helping their mates just to shift their properties or shift livestock. Do the daisies go as well, James? Do the moot cows move as well? They do indeed. So for some of them it's moving day. And that's a big challenge, you know, shifting a few hundred cows. It's not an easy job. So for some of them, they'll be on the road today as well. Yeah, look out for the cattle trucks coming to a state highway near you. James, what will farmers be looking for when they change farms? Given there's been huge variations in the conditions around the country affecting the land, some people have been in drought, some people have been under water. Does that affect where people go and how they choose? A lot of those decisions on where to go have been made months in advance. It does create a few challenges at this time of year. When coming to a new farm, it needs to be set up properly for the next season with pasture covers and supplements on hand. So with some dry conditions in the Waikato and Southland, we're not meeting those target covers. So there's going to need to be a bit of planning, a bit of negotiation about how we meet those targets that might not have been met and what that means for the year ahead. What opportunities does the new season bring for the industry, particularly for young farmers, James? Well, I've been around the dairy industry for a while now and look there's massive opportunity out there and I think more opportunity now than ever before really. You know the industry does need a number of new workers you know two to three thousand more staff to come into the industry but conditions are good you know the pay rates have increased, the accommodations increased, and the working hours have certainly come down. Combine that with the fact that, you know, the industry isn't a good place at the moment, and there's good profitability. We're starting to see a number of young farmers progress from workers to managers to share milkers and now owning their own farm. And so how many other industries in New Zealand can you get to owning your own business? So to me there's a great opportunity out there. So good prospects for those wanting to get into the industry thinking it could be for them. If they need any enticement, Fontera's forecast a higher payout for next year, that can surely only help? Things are looking great for next year. We've just come off a strong payout, and yes, costs have increased, but the frontier payout has increased significantly for all dairy companies. So prospects are looking ahead. They're looking great. There's a little bit of uncertainty with what's going on throughout the world and around costs and supplies. But really in New Zealand, I think this is the best place to be for farming at the moment. Good opportunities. All right, well, good luck to all the farmers and the daisies moving homes today and this week coming. Ag First Managing Director James Allen. To international news now and China's attempt to woo the Pacific has been largely successful landing deals with many of the island nations and strengthening relationships. Joining us now with more is A.M. Pacific reporter, Edward, good morning to you, Edward. A marathon tour by their foreign minister and deal after deal inked, but not total consensus with all island nations. What's the latest? Look, that's right. I mean, it has been an extraordinary tour to watch unfold so far over the last few days. So Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in the middle of this remarkable 10-day tour, I believe it is, across eight Pacific Island countries. It started last Thursday in Solomon Islands, where China stitched up that security deal, which we've been talking about the last few weeks, has been very controversial, this closening relationship with Solomon Islands and Beijing. But China came to the region with a far more ambitious plan, which was to attempt to sign a region-wide economic and security partnership with the entire Pacific Island Forum countries. So, you know, that certainly represented a bit of a shift in the tone and the tenor and the pace of China's engagement in the region. Now, it's been quite successful so far on this trip. It has signed a few economic deals specifically with Kiribati, Samoa, Fiji, and even just yesterday, in a way, the small country of just 1,700 people, which is actually in a freedom of association with New Zealand. The efforts of the Chinese, though, have not been entirely successful. As I mentioned, it was attempting to sign this region-wide deal. That received quite a bit of pushback from certain Pacific Island Forum members, particularly Micronesia. And, you know, the Pacific Island countries, they typically try and move forward on a consensus basis. And you can tell there was some friction between countries around deepening those ties with The Pacific Island countries, they typically try and move forward on a consensus basis. And you can tell there was some friction between countries around deepening those ties with China. Some are very concerned about the region becoming a thesis for geopolitical contests between the United States and between China. So despite the fact there were a few of these deals that have been signed, there is a bit of reluctance in the region about deepening ties with China. Because what do the deals exactly cover? Presumably, it's the likes of security, free trade, humanitarian support. There are some island nations drinking that collate. That's right. And some of these deals, we don't know precisely what is in them. I mean, it's not like there's going to be Chinese military bases popping up tomorrow out of these deals. Most of them are based around basic economic cooperation, further assistance on COVID-19, perhaps easing of trade restrictions and travel restrictions potentially between the two countries. But we just don't actually know what's specifically in these deals. That raises many concerns. We only actually knew what was in this region deals. That raises many concerns. We only actually knew what was in this region-wide deal because that deal was leaked. It was leaked by one of the Pacific Island countries that received that deal. And that was the only way that the international community actually knew. And unfortunately, there's been very little press access to Foreign Minister Wang Yi as he's been travelling around the region. We've even seen local media boycotting the press conferences with foreign minister Wang Yi because he typically won't answer any question. So there is a bit of opakness, unfortunately, in these deals. They're wanting to keep things tight, certainly. China has said it's proposing being involved in training police, cyber security. That will certainly raise red flags for many. China says don't be anxious, don't be nervous, but many are serious concerns, particularly from security experts, Ed. Yeah, look, that's right. There's obviously a concern amongst the Pacific's traditional partners, particularly New Zealand and Australia, that these ties are more than just economic ties, that they're about positioning China in the region more deeply so that, you know, many years down to track potentially if there was some sort of conflict globally, that China's going to be in a good position to work with these countries for their own security. So we're two from here, Ed. What next? Yeah, look, I think there's going to be a continuing push from countries like Australia and New Zealand to actually reanimate its ties in the Pacific to, you know, extend these step-up arrangements that we've seen over the last few years. The United States is looking to do more in the region. And we actually just saw Fiji while it signed a cooperation agreement with China this week, it's also actually signed another strategic framework agreement with the United States. So many of the Pacific Island countries are very at playing one off another. I think we're going to see more action from Australian, New Zealand, United States as a counter to these Chinese encroachment. I'm not sure you can serve two masters, especially when it comes to China v America. AM Pacific reporter, Eric Kavanaugh, always good to chat and get your thoughts.

Time now for us to rip around the country and check in with our reporters. And first of all, it's good morning to Mitch Redmond in Christch. And a shooting last night. Gosh, the theme seems to continue, Mitch, even down south now. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. After a raft of shootings in Auckland last week, police have arrested two people in Christchurch after reports of gunshots last night. Now, around 11 police units were called to the car park outside the One Good Horse and turf restaurant and bar in Parklands just after 9.30 last night. Now, fortunately, there have been no reported injuries. However, it could have been a near miss with all the neighbouring properties, mainly being residential addresses. At this stage, not a whole lot is known. But police are continuing their investigations and two people are expected to appear in court later on today. All right, thanks for that update, Mitch, and we'll check in with you if there any further developments on that as they come to hand. Let's now say more than to Tia McDougal in Wellington. And we're talking housing to you. Talofa, yes, Wellingtonians are not very happy after the council's latest review into residential housing infrastructure. That's just homes that people live in, in the Wellington region, was found to be really sufficient. For the next 30 years, the Wellington Council's review found that Wellington's actually going to be okay and will be able to keep up with demand of growing and moving populations, which Wellingtonians are not happy about. They say almost every Wellington city home has mould in it. Most of them don't have car parks, even Nationals. Chris Bishop has pitched in and say that's a bit of a ridiculous review and that's very much not the case. People living in Wellington will find it not the case. So there's a bit of a call for a new review into the Wellington housing situation. So hopefully we'll see how the second review turns out. Another review, fun times. Thank you for that to you. Let's now head to Nats Levy in Auckland. Talofa Lava Nats. We all need our five plus a day, but it seems like there's a real lack of green space in Auckland. Yeah, Tala for Lava to you, Byrne. Yeah, it seems in South Auckland they're feeling the squeeze of the urban sprawl. Now, Pukukkowi, which is some of the most fertile soil in the country, and the region alone is responsible for 26% of the share of the nation's production of vegetables, is feeling the pinch on productivity and not being able to expand and do all the production that they want to, fruit and veg-wise. Now, there is calls for help, and we know that with the increasing costs of food in the supermarket, that it's pretty important we get our share while we can. And in fact, Pukukaui is responsible in the mainstay for vegetables between the months of October to December. And, you know, the loss of this production could see those prices increased by 30 to 40 percent just due to lack of efficiency. For Ifatau Lava, Nat's Levy, those were our reporters around the Motu. That was AM early. It is four minutes to six."}
