There is a way for them, a complaints process, I believe, through NZ bus and NZ bus talk with our staff at Toi Moana about what we do, what we can do to kind of fix those sorts of things. Peart, it's the head of the one of the people are the that's the kind of the behaviour on the country of Taurangah. It's a lot of the colour of that's a colour in these tumourses but, I think the counciller this councill honour to recognise, it's not the behaviour of Tauara only, the he? It is Tauranga Girls, it is Mount College, it is Ohtumoy College, there are students from all over who are doing this, it is not just solely Tadanga Boys College.

Warr, Member Parliament of Labour, and his quote, poor, and maybe a Maori that's for taking for the vote to the Rope in the Covying of Porte this year. Kyi, Tepene Allen, this part 14 years To use a sporting analogy I left it all on the field....... Rawa inue...cowpout....to be very clear that this was not entirely my choice. Rawa endued....this are always going to make mainstream political leaders uncomfortable.......horekow in the to war......aughta not another ethnic group....he take-a-a-a-a-party......he have not as a party and as a government......the status of Māori is the Indigenous people of Altearoa, New Zealand. the United Goals. It was a kātaker of the Party Labour in 2020, but they've been wronged, they're wronged. She's probably more confirmed that what we have in the Maori electorate, and particularly in the Māori seats, is a very volatile vote. The Maori vote in the electorates was clearly for New Zealand first, but the party vote was clearly for Labor. We as a people signalled very early on in those electric seats that we expected in New Zealand first in Labour coalition. And then when that didn't happen, well, next time round, 1999, for swing back the other way. The manateau-o-wha-pure, he's pooh-pour, a co-polaise, a programme-mato-me, a programme honour honour honour honour honour honour honour honour honour honour honour honourua and its first people,... would remove the propensity that allows people to ignore our reality as an Indigenous people that continue to suffer the scrooge of colonisation.... he was then able to put it in the members' ballot but was directed to withdraw it prior to the 2020 election.

He's a good pigeper, no. That's my kind of clay right there. That is the way of Toa Hunter Gatherer. Toa Hunter Gatherer, we are of Melanesian heritage. Headhunters, traders, men and women of the sea. We are not mainly an Aboriginal Australia. We are not mainland Aboriginal Australia. We are Torres Strait Islanders with their own culture, language and way of life. Niemun Malu, our sea, our brother, our land. Niemun mina yapa tamay. Our beliefs make us who we are. Kifakaata, Maori. I remember I was seven, and my dad took me to Anzac Day. And it wasn't until afterwards when I asked Dad what was going on, in particular the poppy, and dad said, that's your uncle. I see my father put on their uniforms, putting on their poppy, you could see the pride. Join us live from Tama, Te Capua at the Pap-Yo Uru Marai, of HinaMutu. And Zach Day, live from 5.45 to Fakaata Maori. When I signed up, I thought it would be a big invention. Trapnel and rifle bullets were flying like a hayland. Gallip was nothing more than a butcher shop. Everyone calls me Ham. A Maldi officer in the New Zealand army. Now, that was rare. I wasn't afraid. It was just intense excitement.

He and his team, the Tidogans, he took at the fringathear, 16-4-4. I really wanted my parents to be there. I really, really wanted them to see that moment. But times are tough with COVID and everything. But receiving it, all I wanted to do is come home and show my parents. To mehue to you, I'm sorry I, I'm to your mother. I'm here to my, I'm to your carua. A time? A, hey. What, Natae? And the Ti, hey, he? That's just a little to her papa and his carua, eh. However, there, I see the time the time that I'm, to be in the coa gnaqa for a long to come to come to come and too, and to move his kutti. And for his papa, he's to play. Hey ho, runger myriam for that family. We had a rocky start and just seen all these smiles. It's unexplatable. When the dragons scored in the first minute and a half, we're like, here we go. But yeah, half time we've got a little bit of a growling, but our girls stuck in, right till they're very end.
