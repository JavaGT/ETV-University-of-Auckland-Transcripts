A lot of rural areas, you'll just see the inattention is a big one. So that's be on your cell phone. It only takes as you can see on this road a really, really small amount of time for your car to go into the drink. Most cars, when they go into the drink, they'll float for quite some time and a really, really important factor, especially if a young person, if you get yourself into that position where your car goes into the drink the best practice is to get out as fast you can don't worry about taking off clothes or any shoes or things like that roll down the windows or wind down the windows with the electric buttons because they'll still work and get straight out of the car the biggest concern we have around alcohol and driving is that it in slow it impairs people, makes them think they're better drivers and they really are. And your reaction times get slower. Absolutely in trying to get out of a car when it's in the drink if you're impaired with drug to alcohol would be a huge factor. And especially with this cold too because that shock with that cold water hitting you, you're not going to be dressed up like these chaps here, you're going to have in a t-shirt and you're going to come from a hot car. So that involuntary gasp is probably all it takes for you to drown. If you take a lung full of water, then basically it's all over. Another really important thing to be thinking about in terms of reckless driving, and I think this especially applies to teenagers and young adults, is not putting people in the boot because, you know, you might be coming back from a party and there's too many people in the car, you need to take everyone home so you just put someone on the boat keep your head down or you know your own new way to enjoy for something like that someone's underage someone doesn't want to pay entry fee whatever it is it's so not worth it because if your car ends up going into a body of water everyone else may be able to get out of the car but that person in the boot is going to drown really slowly and that's just it's just not worth it so just everyone seats to yourself five people to a car seat belts on"}
