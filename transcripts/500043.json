In 1940, to commemorate the treaty, a Maori meeting house was erected on the treaty site. Every New Zealand schoolboy knows how Hone Hecky kept on cutting down this flagpole as a gesture of opposition to British power. Below in Russell Churchyard are the graves of many chiefs of those days, of whom most were supporters of the treaty. Fishing is a year-round occupation in the Bay of Islands, launches are spruced up ready for the influx of summer visitors and game fishermen. Once this launch only serviced coastal farms, now in holiday periods sightseeing passengers are more important than the cream collecting. The cream run goes as far as Uru Pooka Pooka Island. There at Otahay Bay, passengers take picnic lunch before returning to Russell and Pai here. The Bay of Islands has preserved numerous relics of the early days. With so many scenic, sporting and historical attractions, the place has so many visitors that a large modern hotel was needed. So today, arriving by Amphibian to open the Tourist Hotel Corporation's latest venture is Mr. Holyoke, the Prime Minister. Also on hand for the opening is Mr. Dean Air, Minister of of Tourism, confident that this Waitangi Hotel has all the amenities any overseas visitor can require. Whiteangi's newest building is not far from the Treaty House. The mural of Governor Hobson and the treaty signing proclaims this the Hobson Lounge. For deep drinkers and deep sea fishermen, the Zane Grey Bar commemorates the American novelist who first made Bay of Islands sword fishing world famous. Like many other of New Zealand's tourist centers, Waitangi in the Bay of Islands now has its own first-class tourist hotel. At this Auckland plywood factory, Pinus Radiata logs which have been soaked for 36 hours are placed on a lathe. A button is pressed, a lever is pulled, a blade moves against the rotating log and shaves off the years of growth. A tree is unwound like a roll of wallpaper. After cutting into manageable lengths, these veneers will be later glued together. By alternating the grain, thin but very strong plywood panels are produced. A log ten inches thick can peel down to a thin veneer 200 feet long. But this industry has had its teething troubles. When the logs were veneered, the knots dropped out, leaving holes where branches had sprouted. To produce logs without knot holes, pruning of the trees is necessary. By leaving just enough branches for the tree's growth, most of the not holes pruning of the trees is necessary by leaving just enough branches for the trees growth most of the not holes are eliminated but how do you prune a forest to a height of 40 feet there have been several answers a Swiss designed contraption is perhaps the upper branches. When the time comes for these tre to be felled and peeled for veneers, the effect of this long-term pruning will become apparent. Thousands of yards of knot-free ply will flow from the machines. Deep in Banks Peninsula is Littleton, port of Canterbury and a major overseas terminal. A busy port since its first beginnings, Littleton's trade is rapidly increasing. Hemed in by a range of thousand-foot high hills, her major problem has always been one of congestion. The emergence of Littleton as a proper harbour began in 1850 with the completion of the first pier. Much appreciated by the incoming settlers, this jetty today lies buried beneath the first early reclamations carried out in the late 1860s. Several new docks were constructed to give birthing space to many famous ships such as Captain Scott's discovery seen leaving for the Antarctic in 1901. Littleton can't keep up with its increasing Scott's discovery seen leaving for the Antarctic in 1901. Littleton can't keep up with its increasing nautical traffic and the inner harbor has far outgrown its original conception. In 1957 in the Littleton Harbor Board officers, the first plans for a new Eastern extension were laid. The scheme is under the control of Mr. J. A. Cachin the harbour boards engineer in chief, after whom the new work is named. Sixty-one acres of new land had to be reclaimed from the sea, a large undertaking which presented many technical difficulties. On the new area are built large cargo sheds, railway tracks and an extensive roading system to provide a new access for land transport. The transport of goods between the port and Christchurch has been speeded up by the new road tunnel and with the completion of cash in key, the incoming traffic will be handled with ease a look-out point from the road on the hill above gives a complete view of the key two-thirds of a mile long Sir Bernard Ferguson performs the opening ceremony of the first birth on a Saturday late in November the exact month predicted by the engineers seven years ago. Today marks the first achievement in the harbour board's plans. Later after the completion of the new extension, the whole of the old harbour is to be remodeled. A credit to its designers, cash and key is a great step up in increasing the efficiency of Canterbury's commerce with the world."}
