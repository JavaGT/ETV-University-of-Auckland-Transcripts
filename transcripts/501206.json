There's always a monster lurking in the bottom of the garden somewhere. My 200 tomato plants are flourishing. Good morning, you two. And my barkshire sows, Pinky and Dolly are expecting 10 piglets apiece. And we have more little piglets. Yes. Congratulations, you beautiful pig! But I've got a long way to go before I turn Digger into a working dog. This is good. It shows me that he's got an instinct there. This time I get set to welcome some chirpy new additions to the farm. That noise, that's their singing. That cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap in the background. Yeah, that's something that you'll really need to tune your ear into. And fresh. That noise, that's their singing. That cheap, cheap, cheap in the background. That's something that you'll really need to tune your ear into. And fresh from my very own dairy, I'll whip up a cheese that's chock full of creamy goodness. And there it is. Bessie's beautiful barata. Oh, I'm sorry. My Jersey Cowell Bessie has been supplying me and her bull calf with fresh creamy milk every day now for almost nine months. Dig it, duck. Come on. Come on, it's milking time. Come on. But today, she's off to join the neighbor, it's milking time. Come on. But today, she's off to join the neighbour's herd to hopefully mate with their stud bull. Come on, good girl. This is pretty much my last chance to milk Bessie for a while. But it also means it's time for me to start thinking about what to do with her first calf. Good girl. They're here for you, Bessie. Can you hear them? Although I'll miss our morning milking ritual, to keep their milk flow up, dairy cows should carve once a year. I've done a trade with my neighbour Tracy. Her cattle have been having a free feed on my pasture and in return she'll help herd my cow over to her yards to meet her prize black limousin stud bull. G'day Trace. Hey Paul. How you going? Pretty good. Very graceful dismount. So how we're going to do this Trace? Well I was thinking we might push her out into our lot. Okay. And then we'll just head over. And we're going to do this ourselves? No, I'll go home and get the family on motorbikes. Perfect. So everyone's going to get stuck in. It's got to be a family affair, great. I'll get mine and you get your lot. I do. Come on. My calf won't stay with the herd for long. Because Bessie would start to wean him and he'd lose the great fat and condition her milk has given him. For a male jersey calf, this one's had a very long life. Most are taken from their mothers just a few days after birth. And now he's off to Tracy's yard to get ready for the local abattoir. Cows are social animals. They prefer to stay in one big group, which means it'll be easier to move the whole lot together than to try to move my two alone. And to move a mob this size, I'm really glad to have a helping hand from my neighbours. But my plan was to push my two into their herd, not let their lot come through the gate into my backyard. Come on, come on you like, come on. I knew it was going to be easier said than done. Where's Beth? Come on! She's ahead. Come on. Bessie's having no trouble finding the cattle yards. It's like she's been there before. Yeah it is actually. So we push these stragglers in? Yeah. Come on. Come on, Gypsy. Get here. None of Tracy's animals will be leaving the farm today, but a couple need tagging while we've got them here. So how many calves are we looking for you, Trey? There's two small ones and then there's your big fella, yeah. Is that little guy in there? Yeah, he's got a tag. Oh, he's going to say. I need to tag my calf for the abattoir, and Trace is going to show me how to do it. Paul, they're here, both of them. Here's our, here's our car as well. How good's that? All three. Oh, oh. No, go, go. How good start? No, good side. Next to Tracy's calves, mine looks the size of a ball. So we've got our three calves in Trace. Now comes the fun part, I suppose. What's next? Well, the too big too, we can run down the race, so a bit too big. But the smaller one, you can catch that one for me, and I'll tag it. I can catch it. Yeah. Easy, right? Piece of cake. Yeah, I'll show you how it's done. Here we go. Come in, little guy. Come on. You two. You too. You too. He's a lively little one, Trace. Hold his front legs. Front legs, yep. Yep, yep. Sit him on a ground like that, yep. All right, this one's the electronic. Okay. Your tag. That's what I've got to put in my calf as well. Yep, it goes in the right ear. Yeah! Like a pro. That's your little fella. Off you go. Happy as Larry. Come on. Oh, beautiful. It's ear tag in time. It's ear tagging time. That was easy. I can't believe I was stressing out about that. You're all right, aren't you, mate? Looks like we've tagged my calf just in time for his transport to the abattoir. Gidey, you must be right. Yeah, poor, how you going, man? Paul, good-de-s, mate. Yeah, likewise. So I've got the young fella up in the yards up there. No, now as long as we've got the dreaded paperwork, we'll be right. This dreaded paperwork? Yeah. There we are. Beauty. Come on. Come on. Good boy. Good fella. Cheers to that, Ray. No problem. Done a problem. Done. Done. I'm pleased he had such a good life on a good life on Cheers to that, Ray. No problem. Done. I'm pleased he had such a good life on Mother's Milk and fresh pasture. And in a few weeks, I'll find out if that's paid off, when hopefully I'll reap the benefits of raising a Jersey calf. I've got a great idea for Bessie's last pail of milk. I'm going to make a barata, which is a traditional cheese from southern Italy, and it's about as deliciously decadent as a fresh cheese can get. I'm straining about 4 litres of Bessie's milk through some cheesecloth to get rid of any impurities from the pail. There we go. Add some citric acid powder dissolved in water and then heat slowly. I want to bring this milk really gently up to 32 degrees. So an essential piece of kit in every kitchen is a probe thermometer. As the milk begins to heat and the curds in the way starts separating, you'll see what looks like little clumps of cottage cheese coming to the surface. And so that's the curds and just keep a sharp eye on that temperature gauge because 32 is where we want to be. I'm adding some vegetable rennet. It's a natural enzyme that separates milk into solid curds and liquid whey. I'm going to pop a lid on that pot. While the rennets off to one side working its magic, I've got a chance to whip up a quick accompaniment. And I think that some sweet, earthy, roasted baby be straight from the garden is going to be just what the doctor ordered. I'll just pop those beats into some baking paper then add some aromatic bay leaf and thyme, a drizzle of olive oil, season and then they're ready for the oven. As the beet roots roast, the paper will trap in any moisture and help them steam in their own delicious juices. That'll take about 20 minutes in a hot oven, which gives me enough time to check on Digger Dog and pick some garden fresh basil for Bessie's Barada. That is absolutely perfect. If you just get your finger in there and gently tease that curd away from the side, and if you can see it coming away as a solid mass, that's when you know you're right to go. I'm cutting this firm curd into large squares to help the watery way run off more freely, then popping it onto the stove for a quick reheat until it reaches 45 degrees Celsius. Ah, that is looking so good. Just like a perfect little ball of mozzarella. Ladle the curds into a colander to separate them from the way. You can use the way later to make a truly delicious ricotta or to braise meats in. To make the filling for my barata, I'll tear some of my curds into fresh cream. This cheese came about as a way for mozzarella makers to use their off cuts. They'd tear up the curd finally into fresh cream and then stuff a mozzarella ball with it. Now a fabulous filling deserves a wonderful wrap. I've got a kettle full of water here that's just short of the boil. You want to keep this close and keep it warm because you may need to top up with warm water through the process. Add some salt to the water. And that's perfect, nearly as salty as seawater. And immerse the curds. Now you need that water to be hot. So as you're needing the cheese, you can see the curds stretching and melding together. So just keeping that process up, of working one ball, getting a nice bit of shape, a bit of a need, onto the next one. The cheese becomes smoother and shinier. So the more we need it, the better it gets. Now I've nearly got that curd exactly where I want it. Nice and thin, as round as possible. Just pop that back in the hot water for two seconds. And now it's time for the fun part, filling them up. Put a generous dollop of the creamy cheese on top and seal it up. The curd's quite forgiving, so don't panic if it starts to stiffen up. Just give it a little dump back in the water and it becomes workable again so I'll just give that a final little seal and pop it into a bowl of ice cold water that ice water will help cool and set the curd all that's left to do is put the whole dish together drizzle a little olive all over the sour dough arrange the beetroot and pop the barata on top there we go a garnish of torn basil leaves, some more oil, season, done. And there it is, Bessie's beautiful barata with some roasted baby beetroots. Mmm. That is so good. I really feel like I've done Bessie's final pail of milk justice. The rich creaminess of the barata with the earthy roasted flavors of the beetroot. It's a match absolutely made in heaven and that little ennecede flavor of the basil really tops it off. I'm really happy with this. Stare off digger. Every day on the farm brings a new challenge. Today's is rescuing my prize hens from the attentions of a very enthusiastic rooster. Where are you, Tanger and bow? But first, I have to catch them. And that's a dangerous mission with rigorous Ron around. It's one, you don't know where's your sister? Oh. Sorry about that, girls. These two chooks along with Ron the Russo. I got it for bloke last year. Now they're a premium show stock and there's a little bit of an exhibition coming up in about a month. And as you can see from these bare patches on the saddle and on the back of the head, it's not exactly the most gentle lover. So I'm going to separate my two girls and I hope that they can get some blue ribbon feathers ready in time for the show. I've got a lovely sanctuary ready for them. There you go. I just hope their feathers grow as fast as the veggies around here. My feathered friends seem happy in their new home, but looks like I'll need to either keep digger at a distance or up the ante on his training. All of God's magnificent creatures are no match for God's gift to hunting. He does this a lot, but then he gets them. Got in. And carries them on his back like a manly man. My favorite thing to do in the world. That's unsettling. But at least you get a good meal out of it. My favourite dish that I've created, Antler Pie. But yeah. Man Eats Wild.

I'm almost into my second year on the farm, and I'm ready for some big improvements. I'm off to see some neighbours of mine. They're a farming family who live just over the hill, and I've heard they've got some really interesting techniques for turning pasture into quality produce. And one thing I'm not short on is grass. I've practically got the stuff coming out of my ears. I'm still a farming novice, grateful to learn from the local community. The owners of this fertile organic farm keep their livestock on the move in a system known as rational grazing. And I'm hoping they can help me to upscale the livestock on my farm. Gailay guys. Hi, Graeme. Good to see you too and you, Mandy. What a spot. Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it? Another slice of Tilba Paradise. Yeah. Well, the reason I've come over today is because I've only got a 23-acre block. So do you think that an operation like you guys have here can be scaled back? It's a system that's going to work on any scale. Smallest as farm, you know, a few acres, it works. And it's daily, like we're moving cattle every 24 hours. Chooks in the chook tractors. Every day they're moved to fresh pasture. And they're following along behind the herd of the cattle. So you still get a product to sell and the farm fertility actually increases. Exactly. And it just really puts the zing back in farming. Like we just love what we do. Well I'm excited. Can we go and check it out? Absolutely. Awesome. We'd love to show you. Over here? Yes. All the animals here, including the free-range egg layers and the meat birds in chook tractors, help to fertilise the pasture. So this pasture is looking beautiful. As time goes on, you get that real amazing biodiversity of grasses that have just been there for years and years and all of a sudden appearing. So this is the heart of the operation. It is. The chook tractors. And here's our main man, Heath. He's our youngest son. Hi, mate. Good, thanks. Working hard. Yeah. Very impressive fleet of tractors you've got here. How many birds do you have? There'd be about, I'd say, a thousand here at the month. Just in the... Wow. Yeah. The droppings from all of these Cornish cross chickens add nitrogen and nutrients to the soil. Well, these look like they're pretty simple construction as well. They're just all recycled materials just about. And do they take to it naturally? They do. And you hear that noise. That's their singing. That cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap in the background. That's something that you'll really need to tune your ear into if you want to do this for yourself. Because it's basically either the chickens are singing or they're crying. Light, food and water keeps them happy. And well, it sounds like you guys are doing a great job and these are some seriously happy chickens here. Yeah, well, look, happiness is what it's all about. And, you know, our customers, that's one of the first questions they ask. Has this chicken been happy in its life? You know, it's really important to them. And it's important to us. Like, that's the way we want to do it. It's such an amazing system that I'm totally sold on it. It's something that I really want to try and replicate on my farm over the hill. Well, I suppose the only question is now, can I move these tractors? Heath, do you reckon you can show me how it's done? Definitely. If you're wondering why they're called chook tractors, it's because the chickens do the work of a piece of farm machinery, digging, weeding, and fertilising the soil. So as soon as the chickens are, move the width of the pan onto fresh pasture, that's enough. Is that on the old fresh pasture there? That's right there. And they're so excited to get onto the new grass. That's right. They've got a more excited chirp. Yeah. And these birds look like they're panting. Is that to keep themselves cool on a hot day like this? That's their way of keeping cool and the hot weather, but they can acclimatize. So as long as they're cool, they're pretty easy to keep happy. That's right. So Paul, you're going to manage that, okay? That was easy, even for a total novice like me. I can definitely do that every morning. Yeah, you're a chook farmer, I can tell it. Well, I'm not yet, but I really want to be, so how do I make this happen? It's just a matter of working out what you can manage. I'm feeling two pens would be a good number of tractors to have to begin with for my L plates but then how many birds do you think I could stock in those? To start with try 50 and on the bugs out of the system. 50 sounds like a great number. Let's go let's go check out the babies. Okay, yeah. Newborn chickens need to spend at least a few days in a brooder before they're ready to be put out on pasture. Now you've got to count, Paul. Right. Three, six. That's 25. It's 25. So two boxes like that? Yeah. Now 50 of these little meatbirds is going to really up the number of livestock on my farm. And hopefully, in a few months' time, they'll help up my cash flow too. They're lively little things. They are lively. Hey, so. Hecks down, fellas. Go on. The sun's beating down, so it's important to get these day-old chicks out of the heat and into the brooder I borrowed from the Thompsons. Here we go guys. Oh, you're temporary home for a couple of days. But I'll have you on pasture before you know it. What about you? There you go. Is it everyone? Oh, there's always one. Hot. Hi. I'm Ben Bailey.

The new season of Masterhip, Hands and Phase Start Sunday, June 12th on 2 and on demand. It's been a long day, but it's not over yet. I'm at Lake Corona on the coastline just up the road from my farm. It's the perfect place to be on this very special night of the lunar calendar. On a night with a new moon, long after the sun's gone down, you'll find the locals around these parts poking around the waterways with all manner of weird kit. Long, waterproof torches, nets, tires, buckets. You might ask yourself, what are they up to out there so late at night? I know what they're doing. They're prawning. High Summer is the best time to catch juvenile school prawns in an estuary. But with their ability to camouflage themselves by changing from dark to a lighter shade, they're hard to spot. It's not quite dark yet and I've just put my torch in the water to have a look around. And there's a fair bit here, but nothing of size yet. So I'm going to have to be patient, wait till it gets totally dark, till the monsters come out. Now there's a good sign. Some other prorning hopefuls are out as darkness falls. Including a friend who once taught me how to catch lobsters, Dave Krasse. Oh, good day, Dave. Hello, Paul. How are you? Good, babe. How's Steve? Too bad. How have you been? Good, mate. You having any luck out here? Oh, there's a few poking around. A bit early in the night, but... Yeah, it's looking good so far. I've off to a cracking start here, mate. So that's one down. So this is my first pruning season here, Dave. And I bet my bottom dollar it's not the first time you've prorn these waters. Oh no, it's a favourite spot of mine. So why the torch, Dave? Mainly for us, actually. Right. Yeah, so we can see where we're going. Okay. But sometimes I'll be attracting into the light. It's a bit like kangaroos in the headlight maybe. They're just sort of stuns. Stuns, yeah. What's going on? It's burrowing in. School prawns spend most of the time in the sediment, but they come out to feed on plant material, worms and small shellfish, and to migrate. If they're on the bottom, maybe just put your net behind them and approach them with the light and they'll often just flick straight into your net. So slow, steady movements, nice and calm. Yeah, nice and calm. Well, I've got a deal for you, Dave. How about at the end of the night, we pull together everything we've caught, and I'll cook it up as a late-night snack. I've even got some homebrew to throw in as well. Some of your homebrew? Indeed. Oh, that's a treat, mate. I hope so. Oh, there's no way I can say no to a deal like that. All right, well, let's get prawning then. Here you go. Juvenile school prawns mature into adulthood in this estuary. Then, in high summer, they migrate back to the ocean. And here, that's the prime time for pruning. There we go. Easy as that. Actually caught too. It's so good to see such a vibrant waterway. Oh, it's really healthy. Oh, monster. Oh ho! And it doesn't take long to net quite a few more. Catcher the night, that one. That was great fun, Dave. I reckon I've got about two dozen in there. That's a good haul for a first timer, mate. You're learning quick. Thanks, man. How about you? How'd you go? Oh, pretty similar. Well, should we combine the haul? I'll get the cooking gear on. You get the beers? Easy done. Right, we'll see you in a bit. As far as an evening spent chasing your supper goes, it doesn't get much easier than a night prorning. But it's getting late and me and Dave are getting hungry. I want something that's going to be quick and most importantly, a great accompaniment to a beer. I'm thinking crispy fried school prawns is going to do the trick just nicely. Now whenever I'm shallow or deep frying, I like to use rice bran oil because it's got a nice, neutral flavour and a very high smoking point. Seasoned flour generously with some salt and the zest of a couple of limes. I've had these prawns in an ice slurry to dull their senses before cooking. So those prawns are nicely coated and my oil's hot enough. Time to pick out a handful, shake off a bit of the excess flour, straight in the oil. And they only need to cook for 30, 45 seconds in hot oil and they're done. Young school prawns are best cooked in their shells and eaten whole, with a little salt and some lime juice. How'd you go, mate? Very well. Looks like you go, mate? Very well. It looks like you've been pretty busy here as well. Oh, fantastic. Cheers, Dave. Thank you. What do you reckon? Pretty happy with that. Looks fabulous. Mmm. Magnificent. So simple. I've never had prawns that good, I don't think. Simple to catch, simple to cook, and most importantly, it's real easy to eat. Indeed. Lovely night. Cheers again. Cheers, man. I think we've earned this. Indeed. Thank you. You know,"}
