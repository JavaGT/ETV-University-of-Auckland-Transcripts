Thanks Jenny May, New Zealand and Japan will start negotiations for an intelligence sharing agreement. The deal was announced by Jacinda and Japan's Prime Minister for Miyokashida in Tokyo at their first face-to-face meeting. The pair discussed the conflict in Ukraine, tourism and trade. Prime Minister Arden says Altaraw is committed to a closer engagement with Japan on regional security challenges. I'm pleased to confirm as Prime Minister Kashida acknowledged we will negotiate an information sharing agreement. This will support closer engagement in support of peace, stability and security in the Pacific and in the wider Indo-Pacific region. Many families admit they're finding it hard to get by with inflation at its highest rate in 30 years. Inflation has hit 6.9% the largest movement it's had since 1990. As well as high petrol prices, food prices were 7.6% higher in March than the year before.

Australia's federal election campaign has been thrown into turmoil with Anthony Albanese testing positive for COVID-19. The news comes after Albanese went face to face with Scott Morris in an leaders debate on Wednesday and met with residents at a retirement village yesterday. He's vowed to continue campaigning virtually while isolating at home for the next seven days. Russia claims it has liberated the southern port city of Madiol despite hundreds of Ukrainian fighters remaining hold-up in the Avostile steel plant. President Putin has ordered his troops not to storm the plant but to blockade it instead the BBC's Catherine Berahangar reports. After a 24-hour journey they finally reached safety from Maruyupol, one of the worst hit cities in this war. Only 80 people escaped in this convoy. Irena is gently helped off the bus by her daughter Tatiana. I could not leave at first because my mom can barely walk. There's no way I would have left her behind. There was constant shelling. Even as we were leaving the city, there was some firing. And this is what they're fleeing. A full-scale Russian assault to capture the Don Bas region in the East. Marupol, devastated by bombardments. Hundreds of civilians are believed to be trapped alongside the last Ukrainian forces. At the Avostel, still works. Its bunkers and tunnels stretch for miles. Minister Hill, what he called the liberation of the city, President Putin ordered a halt to the attack on the industrial plant. For those who've escaped severe fighting and a humanitarian crisis, perhaps an opportunity to rebuild their lives. But the fear is more Ukrainians will face a similar fate as this war spreads to more villages and cities. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is talking the Ukraine conflict and security deals during a trip to India. The British PM is hoping to draw India away from its dependence on Russian oil and arms, but at home MPs have voted for a committee to investigate Johnson, over claims he misled Parliament about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. The inquiry will be launched once the police have finished their own investigation. So far at least 50 fines have been issued.

Hey look after seven we will be joined by our financial advisor Anthony Sage who's going to give us that advice on mortgage rates you would have seen the interest rate high-cap no the inflation rate high-cup yesterday a 6.9 which is a 30 year high for New Zealand. Yes Anthony Sage yeah that's his name. Give us some Sage advice? Some Sage advice, but very good. But basically, if you have got questions, if you've got concerns about your mortgage rates, if you're thinking about maybe breaking a fixed term early, if you're looking at refinancing, if you were one of those people who took on the mortgage at a historically low rate, the 2% rate, the 2% rate that we were seeing last year percent rates that we were seeing last year and now you're going to be paying a huge difference if you've got any questions put them to us we will put them to Anthony Sage breakfast at tvnz dot co.nz I'm really looking forward to that actually because we've got ours split into three right and one came off not long ago which we've just started a new term able to but then the next one comes up in a year's time so you know we know that by next year's by next year's year's to fix that, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to approach people if they want to break early to get it kind of a better long-term deal. But we knew this was coming right? We knew it was coming right we knew it was coming but it's now coming but it's now at breakfast at t.n.c.co.com. And if you don't own a home, still really relevant to hear this advice because you might be wanting to get into a mortgage soon.

It is day 57 of Russia's war on Ukraine and the situation has worsened in the port city of Marupor. We're going to cross to the Ukraine shortly to talk about Vladimir Putin's claim. His troops have captured the port city but we're going to go to the US first where President Joe Biden has unveiled an 800 million dollar military aid package for Ukraine. Our US correspondent Anna Burns Francis has the latest from out of the White House. More Anna and President Joe Biden vows to continue financial and military support to Ukraine but is 800 million dollars enough? Well it's going to have to be enough for the meantime because that announcement pretty much depletes what President Biden has in terms of funding for this conflict and support of Ukraine. To put it in context around $800 million US dollars is around $1.1 billion New Zealand dollars. Sounds like a lot of money but war is expensive. Now this package mirrors one that was made last week so pretty similar in terms of amounts but this time far more targeted. It's going towards weapons, ammunition and drones as well as a significant lump sum of money going straight to the Ukrainian government to help it pay its bills. Expect though that President Biden is prepared to go cap and hand to Capitol Hill and ask for more money to be allocated to these packages. He made it very clear in his comments this morning that he expects the US could be involved in do this for a long time. The question is, are we going to continue to maintain the support of the international community and keep the pressure on Putin to prevent him from over running the country, number one, and number two, make sure we continue to maintain the economic sanctions. So note there the mention of the international community of course America can't act alone here it needs the broad support of Europe which it has had so far. The White House tends to make a big deal of these announcements and makes a lot of noise about them but as I said war is expensive and you can expect that other countries have similar strategies lined up to keep that support, that broad allyship in terms and in check here as well. Yeah well as you say that a hundred million is just you know a drop in the bucket when it comes to the situation that's going on in Ukraine but the US isn't actually supposed to be directly leading these efforts but it sure looks that way way. And I guess the big thing is, how do the Americans actually see it? Yeah, it is, and it isn't. Of course, the United States is a key player in NATO, so you would expect it to play a leading role in strategy here. But there's a fine line between crossing over into becoming a fully fledged participant in combat. And of course America and Americans don't want that. At the moment, 47% of Americans agree with the level of support being provided to Ukraine, but the number that don't support is not far behind, around 40% disagree with the packages that have been given to Ukraine. Of course, the United States is not acting alone. We've seen plenty of packages similar in nature from European allies of the US as well and they've also offered humanitarian aid something we haven't seen a lot from from America yet. Today the White House announcing that it will pave the way for around a hundred thousand Ukrainians to relocate to the United States. Yeah, the AB, if you're talking about international aid etc. But what about the UN? It's been hamstrung by Russia's veto vote. Is there any way it can help resolve this conflict? You're absolutely right. And it was done right here. We're outside the UN this morning. The flags are flying and the meetings are ongoing. But this was the scene of so many of those late night emergency sessions of the Security Council where we saw that sparring between the Ukraine or between Ukraine and Russia and at times the United States. Every vote vetoed by the Kremlin's power to just say no, it wasn't going to go ahead with those votes or those resolutions that were put forward by the Security Council. So now we've seen a number of former UN officials write an open letter to the UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez requesting that he make or take rather a more open and visible, be a more open and visible participant in the communications around this conflict and the conversations that are happening. And we see that that may be occurring. He has taken on this message. We heard that he's written to both the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia asking to hold one-on-one talks with them in their home countries. The Secretary General said at this time of great peril and consequence, he would like to discuss urgent steps to bring about peace in Ukraine and the future of multilateralism based on the charter of the UN and international law. That was the UN Secretary General spokesman there Stefan DeJarek but no word on whether Vladimir Zelinsky from Ukraine or the Russian President Vladimir Putin has responded to those letters but if Mr. Gutierrez was hoping that those would be the start of peace talks will then you only have to look at the example set so that those would be the start of peace talks, well then you only have to look at the examples set so far by those broken by the likes of Turkey and France to know that the path to peace could be a long and winding one. Anna Burns, Francis, joining us from New York. Thanks so much Anna Burns. I know you've only just arrived back in New York, so we appreciate your time this morning. We're going to appreciate your time this morning. We're going to continue the conversation on Ukraine. And as I said earlier, it is day 57 of Russia's war on Ukraine in this situation. As we understand it, as we're sitting in the port city of Marjupu, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops to seal off a steel plant where the last group of Ukrainian fighters have been holding out, though he has ordered them not to storm it. And what's more, Putin's also, unless the first successful test of a new nuclear missile known as Satan too, which has the potential to strike enemies across the globe. For more, we're joined by journalist Bruno Beekbun all the way from Kiev. Gosh, Bruno, thank you again. It is lovely to see you, and thank you so much for joining us this morning. Can we talk about the reports this morning that Vladimir Putin has declared victory in Marjupal or in his words, liberated the port city? What is the latest? Well, it is very hard first of all because we hardly have any independent ice left in the city since at least two to three weeks. The report we're getting from the Ukrainian side is that contrary to Vladimir Putin's saying this morning, they have again stormed the Azov steel factory. Let me just remind you that the Oz of Steel Factory is a territory of about 2025 miles and underneath it are a lot of tunnels. So what's happening is that 1,000 civilians have actually sought refuge among them relatives of the fighters but also people who lived in the neighborhood because they thought it was safe of the tunnels. And they've been pounding it relentlessly according to the latest reports we get. But once again, it's very hard to get the clear pictures. The Ukrainians, the Ukrainian side say they continue the bombing while the Russian sign says the opposite. What we do know is that in the city of Marjupil 120,000 people of the 470,000 people living there prior to the conflict are still there desperately trying to get out for weeks now and they have not been able to. And Bruno as you said you can't a hundred percent confirm what is happened or what has happened in Marjupa but what would it mean for Ukraine's defense of its country if Russia seizes control of that port city? news for the Ukraine of course because what it would provide Russia with is a land roll to the Crimea. One and secondly it would cut off it's one of the most important ports access to the Black Sea for the export by ship if that would be cut off Marjupal then most of the Ukrainian export there's two cities left there's Odessa and that's left and if that would fall as well That would mean all Ukrainian export would have to be would have to go by road or by train Which of course is much more expensive and they would basically lose An important part of their access to the Black Sea. Can we talk about the Don Bas region? I understand there's around about 75,000 troops heading that way. What can you tell us about the situation there? Because we know that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants control of the East and of that Donbas region has been in a state of war since 2014, so that's eight years by now. But the latest reports suggest one thing that we know for sure, and that is relentless bombing of cities like Kharkif, of cities like Isium in the Donvas, 70,000 troops are there, as you said. and if Marjupel would fall that would free up another 11,000 troops from Marjupal that could have had to the Donbas. Also important is that the actual frontline in the Donbas is about 350 miles long. We can't call it a blitzkrieg because it goes rather slowly. They take one town yesterday they took the town of Kremina, for example, which is a town of 18,000 people, and now they are surrounding the city of Kramatursk. The city of Kramatursk, we remember, with the bombing of the railway station a couple of weeks ago. But fact is, there is a possibility that Ukrainian troops will be surrounded by the Russian troops if they manage to take for example Kramaturk, they can cut off the Ukrainian troops and then it future will be pretty dire for the Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, a very important industrial region for the Ukraine. Bruno, I have about 30 seconds left and I see I talked in the intro about weapons that Vladimir Putin has successfully tested. Can you tell us any more? Is there any more updates that you can give us about the new nuclear missile? Satan too? Unfortunately there's not much I can say about that from here from Kiev. President Zelensky has repeated this during his daily evening address to the nation that he's afraid that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons out of frustration, out of anger, but one thing's for sure. It would be the first time that these weapons are used on a civilian population since 1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Josh, you just, yeah, you hate to think that is absolutely horrific.

A new global survey has done both makeup purchases and how much makeup women are wearing has dropped 19% in the last two years. New habits such as mask wearing has also made an impact with the sale of red lippy dropping by 40% since the start of the pandemic. So working from home is really impacting that, not going down to the pub is impacting that, and this cost of living crisis that is looming, of course that's going to bring the same kind of restrictions to us going out that the manufacturers need to be conscious of. The survey suggested women are pivoting their spending away from makeup towards higher end skin care products. How much makeup are you wearing today Chris? Well I like to go with a little moisturizer underneath. Just to soften the impact of that, I've got some red lip who we can share with you later with you later if you want some. I thought I needed something to pop a little bit so that might actually work quite nicely. Now look at your weather this morning starting off in the north, the wet start of the day.

We wanted to ask her what it would mean for most of us. So we called on an old friend. Weirmo Bayless is a middle income middle income owner with three Tamariki. He lives in Poryu Roo where he rents his home financially buying just isn't an option. He's been on the show before so you might remember him. Our Wellington reporter Abby Wakefield asked if she could hit the shops with him to see just how much rising costs are hitting Fano everywhere? Kilda everyone, today we're talking cost of living. I'm joined by Poddidou, resident Widdamoo Bayless. You have a family of five Widdamoo. How much do you budget for your weekly shop? Usually about $150, $200 a week, just to make sure that we've got enough for the school lunches and our home basics. So let's go do your shop and see how much that comes to. So for three kids, how many bananas do you usually get? Usually the bunches are bigger, we'd probably get something like that. Yeah. Because even if we don't use them, you know, between my wife and I, we like to bake premium mints. 1217. Each. That's 24, over 24 dollars just there. And that's one meal? That's, that would be two meals. Sometimes we'd get a chicken, a stir fry like this. How much is that? So that one's 17 dollars. $1.17. We're probably going through about three of these a week, two to three a week, and that's almost $6 for three liters. So, $5.80 for two, that's already over $10. Yep. Now we're approaching the Bacon section of the supermarket., what would you call bacon section of the supermarket. What would you call this section of the supermarket? Between the butter and hair luxury lane. This is a conscious choice. Three lives. What's that? Three 70 times three. Three 70 times three. This is $9.80. $9.0080. But we order them from somewhere else because they're cheaper.. So we're just going to put these on the back. $9.80, that's too expensive, that's going to break the budget. So, Whitamoo, do you have any pets? Oh, I usually say I have three of them, but yeah, we do have a cat. The other three are you kids? Yeah, three are the three of my kids. Yeah. That is slightly cheaper this week. $9 for the first luxury item that you put in the trolley in the trolley, that you put in the trolley, that's not too bad. That's for your wife. That's for my wife. So you've still got one of your kids in pull-ups. That's another expense. That's another expense. And we usually look to a couple of packs every fortnight. So that's three for $4.50, which, yeah, three bars in that. So it's not too bad. A big pack, 850. How long were that last year? 10 packs? A couple of days. That's 5.50. That feels like that's gone up. It has gone up. I remember buying this just probably about three weeks ago and it was 380. This is my treat. Your treat? Yep. I usually get a couple of bottles of this a week and that's a luxury and it's too much. How much is that though for two of those? We're 5.90 each, so more than 12 bucks. And then we choose this over there just simply because of quantity. All right so we're all done. Time to find out how much it costs. 3.90, 40 cents. Baga. So we've just finished your shop. Now we need to fill up your car as well. So Widdamoo, how much does it cost to fill up your car for the week? So if our vehicle was empty, it would be about $130. Well that's got the freezer. That's the only melted. Where do you want them? Widdamoo. Just over here in the kitchen on the bench. So $400 on groceries, $130 for fuel, power? How much do you spend on that a week? I think normally would probably be about a hundred bucks a week maybe. And then you've got internet, you've got, got you know stuff to keep the kids entertained as well. How hard is it at the moment for yourself? I think most of it is just you know there are times when you wake up at night you know we're going to be we've got enough to get through. Are you saving at the moment? No, I've even frozen my kiwi savor at this point. It affects all of us, you know, lower income, middle income, you know, it affects all of us to some degree. I think a lot of people will be able to relate to Whittimoo, Whittimoo, are you rising inflation? I mean, it went up yesterday, but we would have been feeling that pinch earlier on with petrol prices cost of living grocery shops I think you said his budget was 150 to 200 a week for three kids which is yeah that's it's tight we're looking at mortgage if you've got questions about cost of living and also mortgage rates which we'll be focusing on just after seven don't forget you can send them to us breakfast at at TV and z. We do have a financial advisor them to us, breakfast at tvNz.co.org.unz. We do have a financial advisor who's coming on board to give us some advice. Yeah, looking forward to that. Because, you know, we know that the interest rates are going to go up as well. And what you're thinking about doing with your mortgage, in terms of whether you break it you know that a year or so or a few months down the track that that interest rate is going to go up and whether you can afford to those extra payments for your mortgage. So it'll be an interesting conversation actually. pause is kiwisover, right? Which is something that if you've got the luxury of it you just let it tick over in the background. I don't really think about it. Don't think about it you sort of think I'm putting this money's going away automatically for a rainy day but now people are thinking right now I need to make right now I need to make decisions and way more financial decisions that I would have had to before. Totally, and it just the little things when every dollar counts, I think a lot of people will understand that.

Welcome back to Breakfast. After four years have been closed to the public. Auckland's biggest Cody forest is now reopening. The White Tarketer Rangers have undergone huge mitigation work as well as an upgrade in 40 kilometers of track. It was officially closed off in 2018 after local E'ui tekarao takawai imposed Arahui or ban when it was discovered that Cody dieback disease had infected nearly a quarter of trees in the forest and now work has been completed on several tracks to bring them up to Cody safe standards. All cloned councils by security manager Lisa Tollich joins us now. A more Anna Lisa, first of all I want to start up by saying congratulations it's a good day isn't it? More in it and Dira it absolutely is a fantastic day and we are really excited to be here this morning but that celebration is around the reopening of three of our most popular tracks today which is part of the ongoing program. Unfortunately the entire forested part of the Waitekri ranges is not open so I'll just correct that, but this is a really big milestone. It's a key section of the Hillary Trail and it's connecting Huiya all the way through to Fatipu. Thank you for correcting this. So can I just clarify, that is the Muir track Para-Raha Valley in the Givens track? Is that right? That's right. So these three tracks are incredibly popular. They're connecting from Fatipu Beach right through to Para-ha Valley. And these are connecting some of the most pristine areas of regeneration kodiforist right down into the wetland area of Pohaha Valley and Fodapu itself is a huge scientific reserve. So having these areas now open to the public mean that they can enjoy a multi-day track trip. They can come out and spend a whole day out in the White-Harkerie ranges or spend a few days overnight enjoying some of these campground areas which have been all upgraded as part of this effort. Amazing Lisa and it also speaks to the amazing work that you and the team have been doing. Tell us what has gone on in the past four years. It's been a huge piece of work. Starting back in 2018, 2019, Auckland Council has partnered with to Colorado, Marquis, right from the outset, from the design of these tracks, making sure that the mode of the forest or the health of the forest is first and foremost, and then ensuring that those recreational experiences, the Aucklanders enjoy, are on offer. is first and foremost, and then ensuring that those recreational experiences, they all clinders enjoy, are on offer. And all of this while ensuring that we're keeping our codey, protected for future generations. So 44 kilometers of tracks are now open to the public. And along with that, there's a lot of work that's happening around ongoing monitoring of the health of the forest and some operational research efforts as well. So this is all thanks to Auckland's investment through the natural environment targeted rate and when we combine that with ongoing renewals work we are fortunate to have great big reopening pieces of work like what we see today available to the public. And great to hear the involvement of the Markey, the local Ewe there in this, you know when the regional park was officially closed in 2018 the situation was dire wasn't it? What were you looking at back then? What were you facing? back in 2018 everyone was incredibly concerned about the threat that Kori dieback disease was presenting to our Kori ecosystems within the Waitekri ranges. So Kori are what we call a keystone species. They really set the tone for the forest and without them it has a huge impact not just on Kori, but a lot of the supporting ecosystems around that. to Colorado Marquis first and foremost responded to that threat by putting Arahui across the whole of Tawamui Atidawa and then Auckland Council followed up with a precautionary effort of closing these tracks until we could make them safe and provide that recreational access that are a Cody safe standard. And just so people understand, in case people aren't aware, Cody direct disease is incurable, isn't it? That's right. There are various treatments that are being considered right now, but none of them are a cure and don't have long-term effects on either the disease symptomology or the pathogen itself, which actually causes codeidar back disease. So a lot of research is happening through in this space, both through a lot of our research agencies and institutions, not Akatakitaki, and a lot of agencies also are putting investment into finding ways to halt the progression of this disease. So moving forward with the tracks that you are opening today, Lisa, what is the important information that visitors should know? Come out to the Waitekari ranges and enjoy these new sections of these tracks. Fotipu is very very special and having access back to the scientific reserve is really important. One of the big things that has been focused on here has also been investment in protecting against flash floods in these areas. So the team have worked really hard to make sure that's a reality. They've put work into improving the campground situation, including new platforms for camping, and they've also put a new facility to support people who are staying overnight. So come out, enjoy the Waiteakuri ranges, but make sure that you leave them as you find them, and you're doing your best, putting your best foot forward in terms of helping to protect against the spread of codey diabetic disease. Lisa, thanks for joining us this morning, but also thanks for the wonderful work that you, your team, the local E-we have been doing in the past four years, protecting the Wai Takary Rangers that we are able to enjoy this Tonga here in Auckland, Lisa Tollage, Auckland Council's biosecurity manager for Kai, Kori Diabak Studio. Yeah, beautiful. One of the things, you know, Lisa was talking about when you go into the forest, enjoy it, but leave it as you found it. We have a couple of walks close to where we live and you know you walk through and there's drink bottles that have been left behind little bits of rubbish so all it means is you just take it with you just take it with you and also a number of people who walk through those those tracks and right at the beginning there's a cleaning yes so it's a little thing but it can help save our forests and it can help save our Cody so go you because that is one of the key ways that Cody and diabetic disease was spreading it's just the spreading of the soil if it's on your snaker is the thing the way so that that's small thing but it's key yeah coming up to just after seven o'clock and there is going to be talking to a financial advisor hopefully to help you out with your mortgage if you are privileged lucky enough to have a mortgage so that's coming up just after 7 o'clock but right now here is your news with Chris chain. Thanks Jenny May, New Zealand and Japan will start negotiations for an intelligence sharing agreement.

Russia controls most of the southern port city according to President Zelenski. Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops not to storm the plant and to maintain a blockade. But journalist Bruno Beekman told breakfast from Kiev that Ukrainian forces are reporting continued bombardment. And they've been pounding it relentlessly according to the latest reports we get, but once again, it's very hard to get the clear pictures. Ukrainians, the Ukrainian side say they continue the bombing while the Russian side says the opposite. What we do know is that in the city of Marjupel, 120,000 people of the 470,000 people living there prior to the conflict are still there, desperately trying to get out for weeks now and they have not been able to. To mark Earth Day, Sir David Attenborough has been named a champion of the Earth by the UN's Environment Program. The award recognises the veteran broadcaster's devotion to telling stories about the natural world and climate change. The head of the UN Environment Program said Sir David's work has helped people fall in love with the planet. The United Nations, we're in a new era, the United Nations, is without them we will never solve the environmental crisis. The world has to get together. Accepting the award, Sir David said we know what the problems are and we know how to solve them, all we lack is unified action. To sport and one of New Zealand's best boxes is set to be officially inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame. David Tour finished his career with an impressive 52 wins from 59 professional fights and one a bronze medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. He also fought Lennox Lewis for the heavyweight world title in Las Vegas in 2000. Tour flies to California later today for Monday's ceremony and says this honor isn't just about himself. But I think I'm more proud for the fact that those who I've gone before, those that paved the way for me, and those who are here today have been acknowledged. So I'm not going to take the credit for it, I'm just there to accept it on their behalf. And you don't want to miss the big interview with Jenny May and the tour man just before 8 o'clock. Let's have a look at your weather this morning starting off in the north. The wet start of the day, possible heavy in thunderstorm with those showers. They're going to ease to showers this afternoon, 21s and 22s, the high for you. And as we head south, similar story, rain, possible heavy falls and thunderstorms, those will clear late in the afternoon, 20 degrees the high for Tokura, 22 for Todangu.. Across to the East Coast you'll want your umbrella. You can expect rain throughout the day with some cloud rolling in this afternoon. Getting to a high of 21 and Hastings and over to the west, possible heavy rain early this morning, but expect it to clear for a fine afternoon some strong winds throughout the day for Wellington getting to a high of 20 degrees in the capital. to the south to cloudy day with a few showers this morning, take a jacket with you, also some strong winds as well, 20 degrees the high for Blenheim and Kikelda.

A few cloudy periods and showers for Northland, Gisbon and the wider district. Unfortunately, it's rain for the deep south, and on Sunday, more rain about both islands, mainly in the West, as well as Southland and Otago. Thanks very much Chris Chang, rising inflation. We've been talking about this extensively. You might have first noticed it when you went to the pension part, but then perhaps your weekly grocery budget, but with many feeling the pinch in our everyday cost of living and with inflation now at 6.9% which is the highest in 30 years. What will it mean for mortgage rates? while we hit the streets yesterday to hear some of your concerns? We need to, you know, rebudge it a little bit. Yeah, we're lucky we're sort of on the right side of having had him, having had him mortgage that long. Yeah, I'm very worried. My life a little bit harder. I'm quite concerned about it, not for me, but for young people. I, um, mortgage expires late July, late July. So, so for me, but for young people. I mortgage expires late July, so yeah, it's going to be pretty hefty increase along with rates and water and power and petrol. Well, people have done because of markets, so challenging, people have stretched themselves, and that's where you always worry and think they've stretched them out really low interest and actually that the balance, what they will mean for them when they you know interstates do go up that you know hundreds of dollars a week of being in pay. Yeah it's just you know what it is so we've got a pay we've got to pay it yeah. and in some cases it's going to mean paying significantly more let's take a look at look at this as we can see in the difference between fortnightly payments for a $600,000 mortgage at 3% through to 7% the difference between the lower and higher end being nearly $700 of fortnight. So if you've got a mortgage or you're thinking of getting one, what options are there to help take the sting out of inflation? Well financial advisor Anthony Sage is joining us now with some advice and we're also going to put a few of your questions to him. More than Anthony, thanks so much for joining us. This is a pretty key topic for a lot of our audience today. So if you are one of those people who took on a mortgage last year at those historically low interest rates that we're hitting about the two percent mark you might now be paying thousands more a month or hundreds a week. So what would your advice be to anyone who's about to see a huge hike in their payments? Yeah, I think that's a really good question at the moment. So I think it's more valuable than ever to get the right financial advice. So I'd definitely be pursuing a financial advisor that you can sit down with. You don't necessarily need to use the first advisor you speak to, but I'd go and review a few options with a few advisors, run them through your current situation, look at what your future might look like in the next sort of three to five years, and come up with a game plan in terms of whether your structure suits your current situation, and whether it actually suits what you're looking to do in the sort of medium to long term as well. If you're already in a fixed term at the moment, is it worth breaking it to get into new terms? Yes, so it really depends on the situation. Obviously an advisor can look at that for you. It really depends if I can look at that for you. It really depends if you're looking at that for you. It's a good option for a little bit more long-term certainty that could be the option that you might actually look at breaking a lower rate now you might pay a little bit of a premium for the next sort of you know 12 to 18 months but you might actually gain that sort of security over the next three or five years which can be quite valuable for people on quite limited incomes. Okay so what about floating floating rates should you stay away from them? Should should you avoid them? Yeah not necessarily so so floating rates actually have their place. Obviously, if you have a floating rate, you can actually make repayments beyond the sort of minimum without paying any sort of penalty. So they definitely have their place within a mortgage structure. And I'd also like to reiterate that you don't necessarily need to put your entire borrowing on one sort of interest rate or one style of loan. You can actually split it into a tranches and have a bit of a bit of a bit of a mortgage structure to each one. So we're seeing that more commonly now where clients will sort of take you know sort of those longer term rates but they might also have some of their structure on a floating rate which could be something like a revolving credit or an offset facility which gives you a little bit of balance and gives you exposure to multiple different interest rates and multiple styles of repayment. Right because actually we were just talking about that with Jenny May earlier because some can do that with their mortgage break break the amounts up into different rates right so he's saying maybe a couple of fixed rates in a floating rate yeah definitely yeah and I think historically we've seen a lot of clients sort of gravitate towards those 12-month rates obviously because that's because that is the cheapest in the market what's interesting now we're actually seeing a lot of clients asking about those longer term rates which would be more in the lines of the lines of the three years but it the three to five years. But you definitely don't need to go put your eggs on all in one basket. That would probably not be prudent at this time. But it definitely would make sense to split it up and spread the risk. Split it up, that's good, good tip. So interest rates for a few banks were actually already nudging the 6% mark, even before this week, in preface to what was going to happen with the inflation rate. And the official cash rate, people have forecasted to hit 3%. So does that mean we might see interest rates go higher than 6%? Yeah, that's what we're sort of looking at. I'd like to point out inflation is sort of higher than it has been historically. The target is sort of in that 2 to 3% range and we're seeing it closer to 7-8%, which is quite shocking. So the reserve bank has raised the OSCR quite aggressively, but I do believe they're probably going to have to keep being quite aggressive. They're going to get that inflation back in check. Okay, so this is a question from one of our viewers who is as hopeful, as a hopeful, as a hopeful, as a hopeful buyer, is this the right time to buy, or should they wait? Yeah, that's a good question as well, and a lot of clients do ask us that. I think, a lot of a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really good, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of really, a lot of,, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of, of really, of, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of, of really, of really, of really, of really, of, of really, of, of really, of really, of really, of, of really, of really, of really, of really, of really, of, of, of, of really, of really, of really, of, of, of really, of really, of, of, of, of, of really, of, see a lot of really good deals. Although the interest rates have actually gone up and it means that your payments would actually be higher, you're actually in a situation where you're actually providing a bit more balance to the market. So rather than going to an auction competing with a hundred, competing with a hundred different investors or a hundred different buyers, you're actually able to take a step back, find the right the right property at the right price, and not be emotionally charged and to make a transaction just because it's the first time you can get your hands on. Are you saying that perhaps attending an auction is a bit of a trap? Not necessarily. Auctions definitely have their place. But I think as the prices sort of ease off, we're seeing a lot more sellers, more keen to negotiate. And take your time, get a pre-approval in place with a good advisor, and then take a step back and find the actual the actual what that you want to set a price limit and don't go over that limit, which is what we're seeing with a lot of clients. And we've got another question here from somebody saying, what about refinancing? Is it the time to be looking to refinance your mortgage? Yeah, definitely it's always an option. And advisors can definitely help you with that. I would definitely entertain going and speaking with your existing bank first, though. The banks are quite keen to retain their existing business and you can actually restructure your lending without refinancing it so you could break your structure and get a brand new structure with your existing bank. Some banks will even pay retention cash somewhere in the vicinity of around you know point four point five of the loan amount which is quite good. on the flip side of that coin you're also seeing a lower amount of new lending with new purchases which means that banks are quite hungry for refinances which which means they're offering excellent terms in terms of cash back and very sharp interest rates to get those new clients in. Right. Okay, so are we likely, and this is a bit of a sad one, are we likely, are we likely, and this is a bit of a sad one, are we likely to see perhaps a way for mortgage sales in the future with people, maybe caught out by that press hike? Yeah that's a really good question as well. I don't think so. I'd like to point to the fact that New Zealand actually has quite low default rates on their residential mortgages. It's something like a fraction of a percentage. The banks actually don't really like mortgage e-sales for obvious reasons. The banks actually don't really like mortgagee sales for obvious reasons. It's not very good publicity and they don't and they don't really want to force their customer to do anything with a financial advisor and there's a lot of finding that you're going to get yourself into a situation like that, preempted early, go and speak with your bank, speak with a financial advisor, and there's a lot of options that you can do. You can extend loan terms, you can look at interest only to reduce, you can look at interest only to reduce the payments, you can look at interest only to reduce the payments, you that gives you a bit of time to sort of improve your income and figure out what you want to do long term and maybe give you three to six months to sell the home and repay the debt to ease the burden. Okay, that is a great piece of advice because I think people definitely want to know what their options are if they think they're going to struggle in the next kind of near-term future.

Today's breakfast brew is a hugely popular, wonderfully rich, strong and full-bodied Dilma English breakfast. Lootfait. Ahaka-kau-pama-ma-kake-wakow. Welcome back into breakfast. It's 18 past 7. Seinui is a farming community located 30 minutes east of Marsitan in the Wairi-Rappa, where at least 20 people live. But this weekend more than a thousand people are expected to flock to the town as they come together to remember those who fought at Gallipoli. Tinoi was the very first place in the world to hold an Anzac memorial service. That was back in 1916 and now in its 106th year it's grown to be a pretty big event. Anzac day organizer Alan Emerson has run the event for the past 15 years and it's an event that's close to his heart as he was a troop commander in the New Zealand Armed Corps for 30 years and we are grateful and very lucky to have Ellen join us this morning. Morning, Ellen, how are you? Thank you very much. Well, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We really do appreciate it. I didn't think there were many places smaller than my hometown of Pierpio, but Tenui, about 20 people there. Tell us about it. Well, Tanui, as you rightly say, is a small village, but at the start of World War I, there were 2,000 single men living here. We had four rugby teams, a courthouse, several hotels, whereas now you just got the one hotel, a school, a hall and a craft shop basically. But it's the wider Tanouui community, which is an agricultural community that really supports the Anzac tradition. And we'll have a big day on Monday as we always do. Back in 16 it was Basil Ashcroft who was a local vicar who they lost 38 people at Gallipoli and he had a service and they went up to the hill behind Tanouye in a record across and that crosses the first An take memorial anywhere in the world. So it's a pretty special place. Alan... And... I'm sensing that there is... There's still... There's a motion there for you. Am I reading that right? Yes it is. You know you mentioned that I'd organized that I'm one of a pretty smart dedicated team who got behind it but we've created a walkway five K's up to the cross but six years ago didn't exist. We've got a really good service which is a country service. It's quite different from your slicker city equivalents. The community get really behind it. Wara-Hap-a-TV cast it live on 3-view-41 and also YouTube and Facebook. So it's very much a community deal. All the surveying was done free, the legal work to get the track up and running and now the people of the Wara-Aper own the top of the hill where the crosses. So it'll be there for perpetuity. Yeah beautiful, beautiful Alan. So you're on Monday you're expecting around a thousand people to the service. And I imagine that it, you know, from something quite small that is grown into quite a large event. How does that make you feel that people want to come and remember in Tinoi? Really quite proud, especially considering the younger contingent that we get there. Lots of youngsters, we always get people from Australia. Three years ago we had quite a big contingent from the UK so we get a broad reach with COVID I'm totally unsure how many people we're going to get on Monday but I'm forever hopeful. Hmm you talk about COVID and so for the last couple of years we've had you know services where we've gone out and stood at the end of our driveway to remember so how have things been done in Seaniui the last couple of years? Well two years ago during lockdown we had a virtual service and it was enabled by the local MP Karen Macanaldi who let us use his parliamentary zoom service. And so that worked really well. We got about 4,000 people watching of whom 500 row to see. Last year we still had a big service, but we simulcast it again and had a wide audience. So the tradition goes on, it hasn't been broken but 20 years ago maybe there was 50 people at Anzac Day whereas now as you say there's generally over a thousand and it's just kept growing. Yeah, well you know you've got a thousand people turning up on Monday. As I said in the introduction, you've got about 20 people that live there, so there's 19 others there to help. So who helps put the service together to put the morning together, Alan? We've got a committee that does that. the local vicar, Steve Thompson, coordinates the service itself. But, you know, from the local area, we've got a committee that does that. The local vicar Steve Thompson coordinates the service itself, but you know from the local area we've got an organist, sound technician, vocalist, bugler and Piper so we've got a full lineup on Monday. Beautiful, hey Ellen you're a beautiful man and I cannot thank you enough for being with us this morning and also you know congratulations on an event that has grown and grown over the past you know decades so you know thank you Ellen thank you for giving us a space to remember those who have fallen really appreciate your efforts genuine thank you. Oh we appreciate you Alan. Thank you. Thank you Ellen, Ellen Emerson. Joining us from Senoui.

Seven, Chris will have your news shortly, but I just, I wanted to say thank you Marie for sending us your little message just before the break. I was having a chat to Ellen Emerson out of Tainui, which is a very, very, very small community. What about the way to Lappa? About 20 people? Yeah. About 20 people there, but that is where the very first index service was held over a hundred years ago anyway Ellen has taken on that responsibility of with a committee he'd hate me to say it was just him on his knowing but with a committee to run that service for the past 15 or so years but Marie said thank you so much for doing the story out of Tenui in the first instance we would take our father and uncle out there when they couldn't walk in the parade in Masterton big shout out to the Hapuri of Tenui so thank you Marie and Ellen beautiful beautiful beautiful man and appreciated him being with us this morning on breakfast yeah a little bit later this morning just after eight o'clock. As you will have noticed, I mean, apart from Maddie, not being here, and Chris being here with us, thank you so much, Chris. Yes, Chris is our stepbrother anyway. He's part of the Fano. We have a new member of the Fano, as you rightly say, Indira joining us, next year past eight. rightly say in Dera joining us. Next week Kamao Santa Maria and he's going to join us on the couch at around about quarter past eight. He's been away from Al-Tiaro for the past 21 years. He's been doing some amazing work with Al Jazeera but he's home and he's coming to join Alfano so and he you know he wants to get to know you just as I'm sure you want to get to get to know him but but it's really interesting talking to him about what he's missed. I know, so and he, you know, he wants to get to know you, just as I'm sure you want to get to know him. But it's really interesting talking to him about what he's missed. Yeah, about home. Or how things have changed, right? What he's looking forward to coming back to. Or we can ask him the controversial questions, Vegimodal Mama. I don't have to see what his takes up. that got us thinking when you're away what do you miss about home? Yeah because there's a number of things that he has missed and we will get into that after at a clock with him but you know what is it about home when you go away whether it's overseas or whether you've gone away for the weekend or for a week or so what do you miss? Breakfast at TV and Z.co dot incets. it's just gone seven thirty here's Chris with your news. Thank you Jenny Ma, a financial advisor says New Zealanders with a mortgage should look at different styles of loans. It comes as inflation reaches 6.9% the highest it's been in 30 years. You don't necessarily need to put your entire borrowing on one sort of interest rate or one style of loan. You can actually put it into tranches and have a bit of exposure to each one. So we're seeing that more commonly now where clients will sort of take, you know, sort of those longer term rates, but they might also have some of their structure on a floating rate. New Zealand and Japan will start negotiations for an intelligence-sharing agreement. The deal was announced by Jacindaand, and Japan's Prime Minister for Miyokashida in Tokyo at their first face-to-face meeting. The pair discussed the conflict in Ukraine, tourism and trade. Prime Minister Adun says Aupairoa is committed to closer engagement with Japan on regional security challenges. According to Ukrainian President Zalenski, Russia now controls most of the southern port city of Muripol. The last group of Ukrainian fighters are standing their ground in a Zofzal steel plant. At least 1,000 civilians are also hiding in underground shelters on the site. Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops not to storm the plant and to maintain a blockade. But journalist Bruno Beekman told Breakfast from Kiev that Ukrainian forces are reporting continued bombardment. And they've been pounding it relentlessly according to the latest reports we get, but once again, it's very hard to get the clear pictures. Ukrainians, the Ukrainian side say they continue the bombing while the Russian side says the opposite. What we do know is that in the city of Marjupal 120,000 people of the 470,000 people living there prior to the conflict are still there, desperately trying to get out for weeks now and they have not been able to. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is talking the Ukraine conflict and security deals during a trip to India. The British PM is hoping to draw India away from its dependence on Russian oil and arms. But at home MPs have voted for a committee to investigate Johnson over claims he misled Parliament about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. The inquiry will be launched once the police have finished their own investigation. So far at least 50 fines have been issued.

Right through the hall where homily Ollock is... And finally at 730 to celebrate Earth Day, Sir David Attenborough has been named a champion of the Earth by the United Nations Environment Program. The broadcaster has been honoured for telling the stories of the natural world and bringing attention to climate change. The BBC's just-and-roll ad has more. Like so much of life today, this award ceremony was conducted over the internet, but there was nothing virtual about Sir David's delight. Oh, you have the award, wow! Well, I'm truly, truly, extremely honoured. only a concerted effort by the countries of the world will do, Sir David tells Inga Anderson, the head of the UN Environment Programme. We know what the problems are, and we know how to solve them. All we lack is a unified action. Right. These problems cannot be solved by one nation, no matter how big that single nation is. But Sir David has not lost hope. Look how many whale species have come back from the brink of extinction, he says. The message is that it can be done. The message is that it is possible. The message is that the natural world has more resources than we can possibly imagine. We've worked out how to kill them. Now we could give them a chance for them to come back and save themselves and save us. A characteristically rousing call to action from Sir David just weeks before he celebrates his 96th birthday. Just a few weeks separating Sir David and the Queen in on 96 years isn't it? 96! Gosh he looks incredible. Yeah. Brilliant. I'll shuffle over for you. I'll take you. Hired my sister. Um, so Kamal is going to be revealed.. big reveal on breakfast this morning. I'll shuffle over for you. Oh thank you. Heart of my, heart of my sister. So Kamal's going to be revealed. Big reveal on breakfast this morning. Yep. You've been away for a wee bit of time from New Zealand and we're sort of talking about what people are missing when they're away from home. Coffee for me. Coffee, yeah. It's like Kelly, she said my coffee, my coffee, Miss Shane.. said my coffee machine. There you go. A carpety island, Queen. Yep. I wouldn't miss carpety island. It's beautiful. It's interesting, yeah. Because home, obviously for me, is here on Tamiki, my Kyoto. But my ancestral home, my home, my home, is back in Puypio. And every time I go back there. And that's where I was raised. where my mom still my mom still lives.. And that's where I was raised, that's where my mum still lives, in our home back there. But every time I go home I sleep a lot. And it's really interesting because I was talking to Ollie who's our lineup producer and he's going home this weekend as well and he said you know I love I love sleeping because there's no, you know you don't have the hustle and bustle of the city right. But it's actually about that piece that you have in that space of not only the memories but just the safeness of it if that's the familiarity yeah but you know that's that's mom and dad's place and you know when you're in mom and dad's company you always feel safe you do you do you so that's how it feels for me going back home and that's that's what I miss about home because that's for me that's how it feels for me going back home and that's what I miss about home because that's for me that's my that's my true home. Yeah. Yeah. somehow now I feel like my coffee. Sorry Jamie, that's brilliant. You need to go to Jesus. I think about coffee guys, you know, understand. It makes you feel alive. It makes you feel alive. Jenny, Jenny Man likes to sleep and feel alive and feel alive and feel alive and feel alive. Jenny Man likes to sleep and feel at peace. And spend really wholesome time at home. And I just want to feel alive again at my coffee. It makes me feel better at any better. My answer was not as dear either. The challenge for Kamal this morning is to find that middle ground. Find the middle ground between... Come all you can go wherever you like.. Jenny man at home.. and you you like. Jeannie Mae at home and you just find somewhere and take it straight down the middle. Hey no, no, no, no, no, so Euryria, Ederia, he said that she misses sleeping in my own room when I'm away. Yes, yeah, I'm with her, it's not my room, it's my bathroom, it's my bathroom. I just, you kind of, you just need your bathroom. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you know, I tell you know, I tell you know, but for me, I tell you know, but for me, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, but for me, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I, I know, I know, I know, I know, I, I, I know, I, I know, I know, I, I know, I, I, I know, I know, I know, I, I know, I know, I, I, I know, I know, I, I, I know, I, I know, I, I, I know, I, I know, I know, I, I, I, I, I know, I, I, I, I know, I, I, I know, I know, I, I, I, I, I know, I know, I, I, I, I, I, I know, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I you what, I tell you what, the Prime Minister is currently in Tokyo as is Jessica Machmakai, our political editor, she told you about Tokyo bathrooms, aren't you? Yes, I know, next level, but for me I, I literally, one of the reasons why I decided to give birth at home for my last baby was because I just wanted to have a shower on my own shower, like I just to be in my bathroom, something about... and that's, same as a nice. middle ground. A little ground. A piece at home, bathrooms. Let's get to you, and coffee. Save us. Say about the night. Where it started the day, periods of rain, possibly heavy in thunderstorms, going to ease to showers this afternoon, 21s and 22s, the high for this group, and as we head south, similar heavy rain possible, falls and thunderstorms, clearing late in the afternoon, 20 degrees the high for Tokoro, 22 for Todangya.

David Tour, one of New Zealand's greatest boxes, will be celebrating a very special moment on Monday when he'll finally be inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame in California. And how can we not take this chance to take a look back on his best moments? In 2000, the Sam war in Powerhouse fought the undisputed heavyweight world title in Las Vegas against boxing legend Lennox Lewis. Many of you will remember it and how incredible it was to watch the boy who grew up in South Auckland representing Samwa and Al Tiaruaua indeed all of us on the world stage. David lost that fight but says he has no regrets. He retired from the sport in 2013 with an impressive record of 52 wins from 59 fights and let's not forget that bronze Olympic Medal from the 1992 Barcelona Games. In 2019 David was appointed an officer of the New Zealand Order of Marriage for services to youth, boxing and the community. And I had the privilege of sitting down with David at his gym in Onehongah before he flies out to California later today as he prepares for Monday ceremony which will see his name sit amongst the best boxes in the world. Congratulations on finally being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Have you had, I mean you've had a couple of years to think about it, but now that it's actually here and you're about to get on the plane, how does it feel? Yeah, I feel was good. It feels good. But I think I'm more proud for the factor that those who have gone before, those that paved the way for me, and those who are here today have been acknowledged. So I'm not going to take the credit for it. I'm just there to accept it on their behalf. What are you most proud of what in your career as a boxer? And what are you most proud of now? Well the first, my first pro-debue fight had allowed me to put the down payment on my parents' house and I forgot which fight it was but the second, second fight, was the fight that allowed me to put the final payment on the house. You know, it was a decent career and I've done some decent things in it and where I'm at I'm loving life, living life, loving life. Who are you now? I know you do a lot of stuff for the community. I'm still me. I'm still me. Mom and dad, you know, their lives have always been a life of service. That's the same thing I'm doing. And I served in the ring and you know where I'm not active, I'm not participating in the sport anymore, I'm still doing the same thing, I'm still serving in anywhere can, and we've got a lot of young people coming through the gym, so we have a mentoring leadership program that will put them through and making sure that to become the best box, that you can be, you need to make sure that your head is in the right place as well. Boxing is almost like the gateway for people to step into, but then there's so much more that you can learn from boxing in terms of, like you're talking about the leadership, looking after yourself, there's a whole bunch of stuff, hey. Other boxing is life. If the kids tend to give up in training, then they're going to give up in life as well in what they do out there. So we try to implement a lot of values that happens out in the real world and the things that we're doing here. Here we're a boy from Mangaree in the big smoke in Vegas. About to take on the best in the world, Lennox Lewis. smoke in Vegas about to take on the best in the world Lennox Lewis. What was that like? What was that experience like for you? I think for me I never never really got to understand fully what actually happened. Uh, certainly it was an opportunity for a lifetime. I didn't before the best. Uh, Certainly it was an opportunity of a lifetime. I didn't perform to the beast But it was a tough way to learn sometimes Unless you go through certain challenges or you go through the fire you won't know if you still have what it takes to give it another go or give it another try But it was a great honor at that particular time of my life. Do I regret it? No, I don't. I wish, I wish I could have done a lot better, could have done more, but I was very grateful for the opportunity. I believe they were tough fights, other than in the ring. For me in the ring, it was a safe space for me. I love, I love competing and I love the challenge. Going into the fight with so many other stuff happening. Only one can only try to, you know, try to sort things themselves. And it's not like rugby where you can pull a hemmy or I find someone else You know where you can wake up on the day of the rugby game and you don't feel the best someone is always ready to take your spot And boxing you kind of have a bad day. Poetry Is it still a thing for you? Yeah, it's my reality. Yeah, is poetry still a thing? Because I know, well, poetry, writing, is that still a thing for you? Because I know it was how you dealt with a lot of stuff. Is it still a way of you to express yourself? or to deal with some things? Not any more because I found, I found a light, I found my wife. So I don't need to write anymore. Everything, everything that I wish for, you know, I find and I found in her. It's tough and it's very difficult sometimes for a boxer to explain or to talk to someone that you can trust about certain things that he's going through. So to have the best friend that you can have at a time, your pen and paper, it's the best thing you can let those feelings off. And it might not it might not make sense to anybody reading it because I did the same. I wrote all these things. I wrote it all down. All down. And then I gave it to my younger brother at a time. I said, hey, can you read this for me? And he goes, of course, let me read it. So he read it. And after he read it, I said, what do you think? He goes, you need help, man. You talk about as a boxer that you didn't, you know, trust was a big thing and you weren't able to open up to people for whatever reason. Was that due to, you were supposed to be the man, the strong guy, the tough guy, and so to be vulnerable wasn't kind of a thing? Or am I completely off track? So to be vulnerable wasn't kind of a thing? that understanding of what you're saying for what you're expressing yourself about that's very very challenging. You said talking about being a fighter so I have the sense that you still have that mentality of whatever you do. Did I get that right? Yep, you're right. So what is it then? What is that mentality for you? From being a boxer and taking that through into life and where you're at now? I think it's, it's, I think it's, yeah, you know, it was part of what I did when I was competing, but it should not stop there because life is about fighting. Not physically, but fighting, you know, every day brings new beautiful challenges. So whatever they are, you know, I do my very best to make sure that I go to sleep tonight and know in here I did my best. So you jump on the plane, heading over to the US. Do you have any sense about how you will feel during the ceremony at all? I have no idea. I have no idea. Uh, there's a feeling of satisfaction. It's the word being acknowledged. So not just me. That's your name there, but you're taking all of those that have gone before with you. I'm just said accepted. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's wildest is. Congratulations. Yeah. Most wild desserts. Congratulations. Yeah, incredibly proud. And I know there's so many that would be incredibly proud. Pretty spirit. Everything that you've achieved and, you know, getting the recognition that you deserve. Thank you. I wish my parents were here. Yeah. Probably the first place I visit when we get back.

Started in 1920, 2022, the appeal is the RSA's primary means of raising funds for returned service personnel and as it won't have taken you long to realise, 1922 means, gosh it seems we're, 2022 means this year is the appeal's 100th year. So joining us on the streets of Christchurch is our reporter Isaac Gunson, Keora Isaac. Yeah, Mordenitin, welcome to the Templeton RSA on this day, Poppy day, but one that could look a bit different, and to discuss how different is going to look, I'm very grateful to be joined by Brendan Muir, who is the president of the President of the Templeton RSA. Morden of Brendan, tell us a little bit about how COVID is you're looking like and how people are worried it might affect this poppy day appeal. Okay, good morning. Probably the big one with COVID is people I think a little bit apprehensive especially with cash handling, you know the transmissible ability of COVID, that is probably going to make people we but wary. You know, we haven't been able to get into some of our locations as in previous years prior to COVID. So it may take our stocks, you know, our funds, you know, the sure, the property So yeah, which one. Tell us a bit about, like in terms of funds, how important is this to the RSA's funds? Right, so we've got a lot of basically serving, non-serving, you know, retired servicemen with your class as veterans, but they have served in the defense force, and sometimes they fall on hard times. Even some of our serving soldiers these days can find it difficult to make ends meet, especially with some of the deployments, you know, where they've done MIQ, they've been sort of just haven't quite been quite able to get there. And this money goes towards helping them, doesn't it? This will go towards helping them. It'll give them a hand up. It'll give them a hand up. It'll give them a hand up, it's not a handout, I think there's a lot of people, there's a bit of a difference between a hand up and a handout. If we give them a hand up they can get on their feet again and that way they're not struggling, whereas a hand out the money basically will go down the tubes, which is not good. So we need to get them into the right space to do what they need to do. And that's even for our older veterans too. Yeah. A really important day and you know Poppy Day today and also Anzac Day next Monday. A really important day to remember people who have you know, are given a lot for this country at the going down of the sun and in the morning. We will remember them. If you want to help out the RSA, make sure that you find somewhere that is selling poppings today, it is Poppy Day, so they will be out and about and make sure you get out there and support them. Oh, beautiful Isaac and we'll catch up with you again a little bit later on in the program. It has just gone eight o'clock so here is Christian with your news. Thanks Jenny May. Australia's federal election campaign has been thrown into turmoil with Anthony Albanese testing positive for COVID-19. The news comes after our Albanese went face to face with Scott Morrison in a leaders debate on Wednesday and met with residents at a retirement village yesterday. He's vowed to continue campaigning virtually while isolating at home for the next seven days. New Zealand and Japan will start negotiations for an intelligence sharing agreement. The deal was announced by Jacinda Arden and Japan's Prime Minister Fumiyo Kashida in Tokyo at their first face-to-face meeting. The pair discussed the conflict in Ukraine, tourism and trade. Prime Minister Arden says Altaro is committed to closer engagement with Japan on regional security challenges. President Joe Biden is sending more ammunition and heavy artillery to Ukraine. It's the second $800 million military aid package the US has announced in recent days and will be sent directly to the front lines. Biden's pledged to accelerate assistance to the country in response to Russia's full-scale assault to capture the eastern Don Bass region. Well, we have the capacity to do this for a long time. The question is, are we going to continue to maintain the support of the international community and keep the pressure on Putin to prevent him from over running the country number one and number two, make sure we continue to maintain the economic sanctions. After closing four years ago to combat Cody Dieback, three tracks in Auckland's Waitakadi ranges have officially reopened to the public. A council study in 2018 found nearly a quarter of the trees in the Cody Forest were infected closing over 50 tracks as work began to preserve Cody. Cody are what we call a keystone species. They really set the tone for the forest and without them it has a huge impact not just on Cody but a lot of the supporting ecosystems around that. The Gibbons, Muir and Parra-Raha tracks have reopened with a $2.3 million upgrade including new campgrounds. to sport and the All Whites will play Peru in the lead up to their World Cup Intercontinental rather playoff match. New Zealand will play the 22nd ranked side in Spain on June 5th before playing another game behind closed doors four days later against a yet to be confirmed opponent. The two warm-up games will lead into their match against Costa Rica for a place at the World Cup. The Allwites last played Peru in 2017 for a spot in the World Cup and lost twoill on aggregate. Coach Danny Hay told by news the Uywites believed they can compete with the higher-ranked nations. Hopefully New Zealand is starting to get a sense that there's a lot more positivity in terms of the way we're trying to approach games. There's a real sense of belief that we can take anybody on. We're not taking that that negative approach that even when I was a player we used to we used to take. So look for me we've got a we've got a really good blend at the moment of some highly experienced players but some some youthful players that really aren't afraid of anybody. Formula One star Lewis Hamilton and 23-time grand slam champions Arena Williams have joined a bid to buy English Premier League Giants Chelsea. Reports out of the UK say the pair have pledged more than $19 million each to a group led by British businessman Martin Broughton. The consortium also includes world athletics president Sebastian Co. and wealthy investors from around the world. Finally, the small town of Tinui, 30 minutes out east of Masterton, is preparing to celebrate its 106th year of Anzac Day commemorations. The town of just 20 residents was the first to hold an Anzac Day service back in 1916. It's since grown into an event drawing crowds from near and far. organizer Alan Emerson says it's the younger generation who really make the event. Lots of youngsters, we always get people from Australia. Three years ago we had quite a big contingent from the UK, so we get a broad reach. With COVID, I'm totally unsure how many people we're going to get on Monday but I'm forever hopeful. Tinoi is expecting around 1,000 people to turn up for the town's big day out. Let's have a look at how your weather's shaping this morning starting off with the north. Wet start of the day periods of rain, possibly heavy with thunderstorms. going to ease the showers in the afternoon, 22 degrees the high for Kaita, Russell and Fangaree. And as we head south, similar story, rain, possible heavy falls and thunderstorms. Those will clear late in the afternoon. Again, reasonable temperatures, 22 around Toadangar and Fakatane. And across the East Coast, you'll want your umbrella rain throughout the day, some cloud rolls into the afternoon, 18 degrees the high for Danubeck. Over to the West, possible heavy rain early this morning, that should clear for a fine afternoon, you've got some strong winds throughout the day in the capital, getting to a high of 20 degrees, and as we move south, clouds, showers, take a rain jacket with you, also some high winds as well, 20 degrees the high for Blenheim and Kai Kolda, and further south, cloud a few showers developing this morning, that'll clear off. You left with a fine afternoon, some strong South Estillies this morning for Christchurch and Oamuru, get into a high of 15 and 16 degrees. In the deep south, another wet day rain this this morning easing to a few showers around midday. Then you're left with a fine afternoon. In the Chicago Gore you can expect some strong winds and north and sound 14 degrees your high. Let's have a look at the weekend. The fine day across the north tomorrow. few cloudy periods and showers for Northland. Gisvin and the wider district and rain for the Deep South. And on Sunday, rain about both islands, mainly in the West, as well as Southland and Otago. Thanks very much, Chris Chang. It's kind of looking forward to that underground music ending there. A look at seven minutes past like we are heading now to Tokio, Japan, where Prime Minister Jacinda Adairn is continuing with the second leg of her Asia trip. One news political editor Jessica Machmakai is there and joins us now. The Prime Minister has met with her Japanese counterpart, Fumiyokoshira, for the first time since he was elected last year. How did that go? Morena Indira. Yeah, it was a very significant meeting for Jacinda Arjoon and also for Prime Minister Kashida just because he's new in the job and is just starting to make the rounds of those international leaders. Now, they came out together, they go into the meetings, we get to have the photo opportunities, there was a very grand welcome for her and then they come out and make their statements and we get the written papers about their comments and also some brief statements about what happened inside that meeting and you can read between the lines and there were some quite significant comments. They both agreed that it was a critical time for Russia, for the world, given what's happening in the world at the moment. They also agreed to do an information sharing deal. Now remember, Japan isn't part of that five-eyes agreement that New Zealand is, but it's not clear on what kind of information will be shared. We will clarify that with the Prime Minister this morning. They both talked about protecting peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. And don't forget that China Solomon's defense deal is looming large over that trip. New Zealand and Japan disagree with this deal. So that was brought up in the discussions as well. Now China wasn't directly mentioned, but its presence was definitely felt in the room. But there were some interesting comments in regard to Russia. Take a look at what Prime Minister Kashida and Prime Minister Arjoon had to say. The world is at a crucial moment of ending the brutal invasion by Russia and defending our peaceful order. This partnership matters because Japan and New Zealand must cooperate in water is a deeply uncertain global environment to support the global recovery from COVID-19, to transition to sustainable economies and to uphold our shared values at a time when when the rules-based order we rely on is being gravely challenged. is being gravely challenged. Now, those interpreted comments there from Prime Minister Kashida, he talked about having a frank discussion with the Prime Minister. The other thing that was also brought up was a CPTPP. Now, there wasn't any concrete move there, but it was discussed by the two partners. It's obviously a significant deal for New Zealand, and it will be an interesting deal for Japan as well. Now we are wanting to bring the US back into the deal the Prime Minister is travelling to the US later in the year. The issue was discussed but we will need that weight and that power of Japan if we are going to be able to entice then back the US back to the CPTP. I did see Jess a trade minister, Damien O'Connor, he took a spin in one of those hydrogen fuel cars. How did that go and tell me about that partnership? Yeah, you'll be reassured to know that Minister O'Connor did make it back safely and in one piece and said that nobody raised too much alarm about his first time driving in Tokyo but those hydrogen cars are a big deal. New Zealand can offer clean hydrogen and that means for places like Japan we're really interested. Now we get most of our cars our biggest import one of our biggest imports to Japan is cars. So that's a big deal for us. Now, it's still about a decade away from your eye being able to buy a hydrogen car from a caryard, but we're going to start off with car sharing and they've done a deal to be able to do that. And it's an interesting innovation and technology. Jess, I can't end this without mentioning the Kewi fruit mask cost that went viral yesterday online. It was kind of like the news we didn't realize we needed. But no photos this time of her holding hands with the Kewi fruit brothers like there was in 2019? No, a little bit of inside information and the Prime Minister actually has a photo of her holding the Kewi fruit brother's hands in her office when she went last time to visit. But no, there wasn't as much PDA this time, but it just was a, I think we're slightly tired and delirious on this trip from lack of sleep, but it was quite an interesting juxtaposition of very beautiful, talented traditional performers. And then the Kewi Fruit Brothers dancing in time to that. But sometimes those things when you're on these trip don't always translate back home. This one I'm glad did because we did find it gave us a little smile. I'm very glad it gave you one too. Yeah, absolutely. We're wondering how you guys were feeling because it was such a diplomatic environment at the time. Then you have these kiwifret mascot dancing. It was quite a lovely touch. Jess, thanks so much for the work that you are doing there and for joining us this morning, our political etiquette in Tokyo, Jessica Muchmakai. Coming up, Why the Hechoid."}
