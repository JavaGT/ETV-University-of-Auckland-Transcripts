It is Thursday, the 14th of April, but it's a Thursday that feels like a Friday. Which is the best kind. So good, and we are so delighted to have your company this morning. Yeah, ha'i-a-ne. Coming up on the program this morning, freedom, masks and meeting up. What an orange Easter means for you and your fauna and why the relaxed rules have some health experts worried for our rangatahi for our youth. In the aftermath of the storm, we will have the latest from Paira Fiti after the region was hit hard by ex-tropical cyclone Philly. We've got that in the news throughout the morning. Plus, how seeking help for your mental health could lead to future insurance claims being denied? We've got Consumer New Zealand's shocking discovery for you just after 6.30. And this is, well, it actually doesn't blow my mind because I have a personal connection to this story. It's people seeking help and then being punished for doing the thing that we're told they should do. Yeah, so as you said, that interview coming up before, just after 6.30, right, this morning? Correct. But right now it's just gone 6 o'clock. Here's Endera with your news. At the Maria. For the first time, New Zealanders are waking up to the orange traffic light setting just ahead of Easter. Masks, seating requirements and gathering limits inside hospitality venues have been scrapped, but face coverings are still enforced in retail settings on public transport and flights. The move into orange also means mask wearing at schools is now optional. It does seem like the peak of the Omicron cases are over and hospitalisations have stabilized. So that combined with, I guess, the population feeling that they really want to move on, that's probably the right time to move now. Gisbon and the East Coast have been hit hard overnight by the remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Fili. State Highway 35 between Gisbon and Porthaka is closed due to flooding and downed trees. Many homes are still without power, and in Gisbon, sewage is now being pumped into the Turanganoi River as the wastewater system struggles to cope. The council says it's highly diluted and the mayor's advising residents to play it safe today. We are asking everyone if you don't have to travel, just stay home, stay dry, look after each other and like I've said before, we've done this before, we'll do it again. Slow down and be patient this Easter. That is a message from police and Waka Kota'i, after nine people were killed on our roads this time last year. It was the highest Easter death toll in over a decade. The Transport Agency is expecting significant traffic over the long weekend and asks drivers to leave plenty of time for their journey. And US President Joe Biden says evidence appears to suggest Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. And it's becoming clear Putin wants to, quote, wipe out the idea of being Ukrainian. It comes as the southern port city of Marupol is on the brink of capture. Ukrainian ammunition supplies are low, and reports from Moscow suggest 1,000 Ukrainian Marines have surrendered. The BBC's Dan Johnson has more. The ruins of Mariupol are symbolic of Russia's devastating bombardment, and now the city's last defences may finally be about to crumble. Russian TV says these are Ukrainian Marines surrendering. The pictures aren't verified and Ukraine's denied Russian claims a thousand soldiers have given themselves up. Russian forces are gaining more ground. These pictures were filmed with their troops at the theatre where so many lives were lost. The mayor says it isn't even safe to count the bodies anymore. He estimates 21,000 residents have died. From the 9th of March, Russian military planes were targeting our city. And since then, they have been doing this. You can see that... Archives also been under bombardment, and Ukrainian officials say evacuation routes aren't safe enough to get residents out today. Mr. President, had you seen it now? The U.S. presidents now clearly stated how seriously he views the Russian invasion. Yes, I call the genocide because it's become clear and clear that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be Ukrainian. And the evidence is mounting. It's different than it was last week. The more evidence is coming out of the literally the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we're going to only learn more and more about the devastation. There's more heavy Russian military equipment coming over the border into eastern Ukraine, along with extra troops. Fresh attacks are expected. And these British volunteers have driven from the UK over the border from Poland to deliver aid and help the resistance. Simon's been in touch with a friend in Harkiv. I said, what's going on? And she goes, you don't want to know. She goes, it's awful. We've been bombed all night. And she sent me some videos. And I was just like, I'm in. I said, I'll quit my job. I'm in. I want to do something to help you, help your friends, help your family and help Ukraine. Cars have been donated to Ukrainian charities, but also military units. The last trip out here, the vehicle I drove out next morning, that vehicle, we had a photograph of it on the front line being used literally within 12 hours of our arrival for what they wanted it for. And Ukrainians are certainly thankful. We are waiting for all of you and leave here. Please come here to leave. We will food you. After our victory, come here, please. Yes. Thank you. Victory party here. But before any victory parties, it looks like there will be more fighting. So let's go. Now staying in news overseas, the death toll in the South African province of Kwa Zulu Natal has reached 250 after extreme flooding in the region. Intense rainfall since Monday has seen some areas experience a month's worth of rain in a single day. Mudslides have trapped people under buildings, and the provincial government has warned fatalities could rise further with more flooding expected. Entire homes have been swept away in the region's main city, Durbin. South Africa's biggest logistics and freight operator, Transnet, has suspended operations due to extensive damage to roads. And in sports news, the Wellington Phoenix are inside the A-League's top six after a tight win over the Perth glory. A midfielder, Gail Sandoval, scoring the only goal to secure the Knicks a 1-0 win. As McGarry cut inside for him, can't draw a defender, though. It deflects Central, and a deflected shot is in. Sandival is the man. The Man. The Phoenix returned to Wellington for the first his season on Sunday and take on the Central Coast Mariners. Me, it wasn't a complete performance, but it was enough to get us over the line tonight to get the win and the three points is massive for us, you know, moving forward towards the back end of the season. Like I said, the boys will be pretty excited heading to New Zealand and playing a couple of games over there. Let's check out how your weather is going to look for you this morning. Starting in the north, it is looking much better today. And fine for all of you. Look at that beautiful everywhere, just in time for your treasure hunt, your Easter hunt tomorrow. Hopefully that stays. Look at that, 21 degrees is a high in Kaitaya, 20 in Auckland and Fittiananga. Enjoy your day. Moving down country, it is a similar story here. A sunny day for all of you. And those southerlies should also die out later today. You've got a high of 17 degrees for Taupo. Goodbye, Cyclone Feli. But over to the east. Now this region has suffered some hard hits from the remains of tropical cyclone filly. But today we're looking at morning cloud, which will clear for a pakifine fine day. And it's a lot cooler in Danubek today as well. 15 degrees is a high there. 19 degrees is high in Napier. And to the lower North Island. Gorgeous. The sun's out, get your guns out. It's beautiful everywhere. Get your guns out, Madi. 15 degrees is high in Wellington where you will experience some strong winds this morning, so do be prepared for that. And two, the Weipon, Ther Waipo Nami, the South Island. It's another beauty of a day. Wow, look at this. It's such a change from yesterday, and I'm happy for all of you. Greymouth, Hokitika, you are peaking today at 18 degrees, and so are you, Nelson and Blenham. Blenham will get as low as three degrees today. It's a layers kind of day down the coast. Possible morning fog for most of you here, but that will turn into a lovely fine day. 16 degrees is a high for Timuru, Oamaru, and Othotahe, Christchurch. And to the deep south, it's a sunny day for almost everyone here, but if you're in Invercagel or Rakiya-Stewart Island, you can expect the odd shower. 19 degrees of the high for Otepoti-Deniden. And looking ahead to Good Friday, it's a pretty nice start to the long weekend for almost everybody across the Motu. We've got a few showers in the south, westland and Fjordland that will develop to rain later on in the evening. And then on Saturday, it's mostly fine in the North Island. A little bit of a mixed bag, as you can see on the sea for the south. But further down south, there's a bit of rain there for your southland farmers. So I hope the ground is soaking it up. Nice. Thank you, Endera. It is nine minutes past six. It's been almost 50 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. And in that time, millions have fled the country. Millions more have been displaced and thousands of civilians have died. And now the country is being labelled a crime scene by the International Criminal Courts chief prosecutor as they investigate war crimes. For the latest, let's bring in journalist Bruno Begman in Kiev. Now, before we get to you, Bruno, just letting our audience know, actually, there's about a four to five second delay on you actually hearing my question. So please bear with us. So Bruno, we've got a situation where the ICC is declaring Ukraine a crime scene. US President Joe Biden called the Russian War a genocide with Putin trying to wipe out Ukrainians. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has found Russia has committed to human rights abuses and broken international humanitarian law during its invasion. International condemnations are coming thick and fast. What has the response been? Well, the response from Russia is a predictable one. It's total denial, even blaming NATO for creating the massacre in Butcha, which we saw last week, where hundreds of bodies were found. And the reaction of the Ukraine has been a bit more critical towards the European Union especially, saying that the European Union has actually allowed Russia to commit those crimes for the last couple of years, adding that they don't need words, they need actions to stop this. Ginnie Mae? Yeah. What is the latest in Mariupol in the east, which I understand the Ukrainian resistance continues, but it seems futile. So can you give us an update on what's happening there? The update I can give you is that an advisor to the mayor of Mariupil has denied the report that 1,200 Marines had surrendered to the Russian forces. But I need to add, Ginnie Mae, that it is impossible to verify because we have no independent eyes on the ground in Mariupil, unfortunately. There are reports also that Russian troops are reading a fresh military offensive in Ukraine's east. Can you confirm that? Is that the case? We had two confirmations of that fact of more than 70,000 troops gathering in the east to attack in the next to 10 days that has been said has been confirmed by the Ukrainian armed forces, but also by an advisor to the French Ministry of Defense, that that attack is imminent. But I must add, that is no surprise, because if we look at the massing of troops in the area, at the goal that President Putin has put for himself and for the country, hoping to get a victory parade by May the 9th. Brun, I'm wondering what things are like where you are in Kiev. Now, I know that Russian troops have failed to take hold of the capital and have since left. How are things there now? left. How are things there now? Well obviously there has been an enormous sigh of relief as soon as the Russian forces left Kiev. However, I wouldn't call it back to normality here. We still have the three to four sirens a day. And we just heard from the Russian Ministry of Defense that they have warned that the Ukrainian military is launching might launch attacks on Russian territory. And in that case, Russia will have no choice but to attack the central command in central Kiev, very close to where I'm standing here. So the situation state stands, and that is normal, when almost one third of your country is about to be attacked in the next coming days. And we don't know how the war will go for the Russian forces again. So, yeah, the situation in Kiev has normalized, tension has decreased a bit, a little bit, but people are ready. I mean, all the, every citizen in Kiev's car has a full tank of gas. That should say enough, Ginny May. Yeah, Bruno, look, how are you going? You know, we're here in Altaeroa in New Zealand, we're sitting here, we're watching the horrific things that are happening there. Mariupo, butcher, we've seeing it all, but from a distance. You're there. You've been in it for the last few weeks. How are you going? Well, I've been working here, Ginnie Mae, for the past 25 years, and that goes for both Russia and Ukraine, who are very dear to me. I love both countries. And like everyone else, I hate to see what's happening. And in some way, you wanted to stop every day. But when we see how the violence, how the crimes are going unpunished, well, yeah, from time to time, you do get a feeling of hopelessness. But as long as we can continue, work freely and tell the stories of those people who died and had no choice and were in the wrong place at the wrong time. We owe it to them to continue telling the stories like we're doing now, Ginny Mae. Yeah, and I cannot thank you enough for that, Bruno. And thank you also for your time this morning. Please keep yourself safe. It's Bruno Begman, European Broadcasting Union, EBU journalists joining us in Kiev. Thanks so much Bruno.

Rapidly rising inflation pushed the Reserve Bank to lift the official cash rate to 1.5% yesterday. Skyping into the show to explain why our central cash rate to 1.5% yesterday. Skyping into the show to explain why our Central Bank didn't really have any other choice in making that move and how that will affect the cost of living crisis that we're talking about so often at the moment. We are delighted to welcome back to Breakfast, A&Z Chief Economist Sharon Zolna. Morena, Sharon, thank you so much for joining us. Marina, thanks for having me. You called it, right? You were right on the money with your prediction of what the Reserve Bank was going to do. It was a good day in the office yesterday. You had a really... I bet. New Zealand's commentator predicting it. That was a pretty unique... What do you get for that? Just bragging rights? I got some lovely messages, even on Twitter, which isn't renowned for lovely messages. It's true. Hey, I want to bring people on the journey with us today, Sharon, because I know for a lot of people this is fascinating and they're right there with you, but for some people they hear Reserve Bank or OCR and the eye start glazing over a little bit. But this matters, right? This is big stuff, especially at the moment. It sure does. The interest rates affect an awful lot of people. Inflation affects absolutely everybody. We're talking here about who gets what, how much you can afford to buy each week. These are big issues for people, very personal, very political. So why did the Reserve Bank need to lift the interest rates hard and early like this yesterday? Well, essentially when COVID hits, we all, not just central banks, but we all sort of thought there'd be a big hole in demand, that everyone would pull their heads in and stop spending. So therefore, we needed to add demand to the economy, both through government spending and through cutting interest rates. But as it turned out, people actually spent quite a lot of money, whereas the ability of the global economy to supply all those goods was really hampered by COVID. We had shutdowns and shipping disruptions. So you've got a lot of people wanting to buy stuff and trouble making it that's really inflationary. So basically inflation's just gone. It's just like an off, not just in New Zealand, but everywhere. And it's not just imported goods. It's also the fact that we're really short of labour. Some of that's just because demand is so strong, but some of it's also because the border has been closed. So immigration has been zero or negative recently as well. Is this really the only option the Reserve Bank had yesterday really to make? Well, they've only got the one tool, really. I mean, they've got a few bits and pieces on the side, but really it's about the official cash rate. So you can quite reasonably ask what raising the official cash rate is going to do for oil prices, or global food prices, for example, and the answer is, of course, absolutely nothing. But this is incredibly broad-based inflation. It's everywhere. It's seeping into every crevice. And so if the Reserve Bank can just throw sand in the gears of that inflation process, make homeowners, for example, just pull the heads in just a little bit more, spend a bit less, it'll become that much harder for firms to pass on the cost increases, which is not fun for them, but someone's got to wear it. Then hopefully we can slow that inflation down. And then as you get the inevitable sort of recovery and supply, which will come at some point, then hopefully things will settle down and will be back in this world of stable inflation again. Are you expecting another big OCR hike in May? Is that right? Yes, everyone's now expecting that because the words the Reserve Bank used yesterday made it clear that they were very open to doing this again. Essentially, they think the neutral official cash rate, the rate at which they're neither on the accelerator nor the break, is probably around 2%. So their strategy seems to be get to there quickly and then maybe just see how things are looking and perhaps take it a little easier from there. So talk to us about what kind of an impact yesterday's announcement will have on our economy. What are we likely to see? Well, what we've already seen is some mortgage rates going up. So the mortgage rate doesn't depend just on what the Reserve Bank does on the day. That's the floating rate that depends on that. But all the fixed rate depend on what everyone's expecting the Reserve Bank to do over the next year or two year or three years. And so a lot of, a lot was already expected, but this was still a confirmation, as you know, not everyone was expecting this move. So we saw wholesale interest rates jump again, and so we've seen the retail rates rise. So anyone with a mortgage that's rolling over will now find themselves facing a higher rate. But of course, not everyone suffers from higher interest rates. Savers are better off. And so we saw a range of term deposit rates rise as well, which will be a relief for perhaps some retired people who don't want to take any risk with their money, but have found those returns from term deposits extremely low over recent years. We have talked a lot recently about the cost of living crisis that we're having in this country at the moment. We talk about it weekly on breakfast, if not daily, at the moment. People are really struggling out there, Sharon. So what's this going to do in terms of those in the country that are really trying to scrape by at the moment. People are really struggling out there, Sharon. So what's this going to do in terms of those in the country that are really trying to scrape by at the moment? Yeah, well, it's no panacea, that's for sure. I mean, it's called liver oil. We're adding more costs into the household budgets of those who have debt, those who have mortgages. So you can see why there's some debate about whether this is the right thing to do. But the fact is that consumers hate inflation. It was remarkable. There was a poll on stuff, what should the Reserve Bank do? And the majority said they should raise rates 50 basis points. So everyone is voting for the cod liver. People don't like high interest rates, but they hate inflation even worse and recognise the need to do something about it. Because if you just let it go and it becomes embedded and you get inflation just because inflation because everyone's expecting it. Then you're sort of back in the late 80s world and it took a horrific recession to actually get on top of that. So at the moment we can still quite reasonably hope that with a gentle slowdown that doesn't involve a big increase in unemployment, we can get on top of this. And so that's why the Reserve Bank, seeing that window perhaps closing, as inflation rises further, as inflation expectations rise further, and has decided we better get on with it. But are we in for a bit of a bumpy economic ride for the foreseeable future? Sharon, how bad might things get? Well, the house prices are already falling. They've fallen in the last three months. We suspect they fell in March as well. We'll find out later today. And that is definitely impacting consumer confidence. It's rock bottom. But we, of course, we don't know exactly what's behind that move, but probably inflation is a big chunk of that as well. So if you look at it that way, then that fall in consumer confidence is not a reason to not tighten interest rates. But it does mean the stakes are pretty high insofar as you're adding another impost onto consumers at a time that they're already saying it's really not a very good time to buy a major household item. So for retailers, for example, the risk is they've all stocked up big time because of the shipping disruptions and the really strong demand, and now suddenly if consumers close their wallet, they could be quite caught out, for example. Property developers, it seemed like a really easy game the last two years. Now costs are obviously through the roof, and the price of the finished product is going backwards. Suddenly the world feels like a riskier place. So yes, we are expecting a bumpier year, but we're optimistic that we can have a soft landing. But it's a fascinating time. The whole world is grappling with these same issues. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. We're not alone in needing some cod liver oil, as you say, at the moment. So thank you so much for your time this morning, Sharon. We really appreciate it, as we always do. That's Sharon Zolner, A&Z's chief economist. Right, stay with us. We'll be right back with the latest on the arrest of the suspected New York City subway shooter. That coming up in Endera's 630 News. I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need.

You and me, the guy to to geth on the face line pick me up on the face line pick me up on the way hoop over upovobo viz stella wide open spaces look on faces let you know how long as well out here walk on face is where I'm here We're moving on coasts, we'll be moving with the times, Alpero, and so we're moving with the times, Aalpeer. And so we're moving with you. The Broho Ranku here is your 630 news. To some breaking news, a suspect in yesterday's New York subway shooting has been arrested. The man was taken into custody 24 hours after 10 people were shot in the Brooklyn station. 23 people were left injured from the two smoke grenades and gunfire that were unleashed on the train car. New York police are set to give an update shortly. And back here in Al-Teroa, masks and seating requirements have now been scrapped for hospitality venues. The relaxation of rules comes as Al-Therroa operates under the orange traffic light setting from today. COVID-19 response minister Chris Hipkin said passing the peak of Omicron meant the country was in a safe position to ease rules. Face coverings are still enforced in retail settings on public transport and flights, but are now optional in schools. Schools are meant to be self-governing. Schools have boards of trustees. Schools serve their local areas. And so I would hope that the schools will make decisions that are appropriate for their local areas. And the Reserve Bank has lifted the official cash rate to 1.5% that's due to rapidly rising inflation. It's the biggest single jump in over 20 years, and ANZ's chief economist Sharon's owner says inflation affects everybody. So if the Reserve Bank can just throw sand in the gears of that inflation process, make homeowners, for example, just pull the heads in just a little bit more, spend a bit less, it'll become that much harder for firms to pass on the cost increases, which is not fun for them, but someone's got aware. The International Criminal Court has labelled Ukraine a crime scene following the shocking images of bodies left on the streets of Butcher. Meanwhile, an advisor to the mayor of Mariupol has denied Moscow's claims. Over a thousand Ukrainian Marines had surrendered to Russian forces. Journalist Bruno Beekman is in Kiev and says the situation in the capital has returned to some normalcy, but forces are readying for a new attack. I wouldn't call it back to normality here. We still have the odd three to four sirens a day. And we just heard from the Russian Ministry of Defense that they have warned that the Ukrainian military is launching might launch attacks on Russian territory. And in that case, Russia will have no choice but to attack the central command in central Kiev. And President Volodymy Zelensky is urging his Western allies to supply more weapons and ammunition. In Shanghai's 25 million residents now in a second week of lockdown, with a situation growing more desperate. Chinese officials have admitted they're struggling to feed everyone with people in the city only allowed to order in food or wait for government deliveries. Tens of thousands of people are being forced into government quarantine as cases surge and Beijing attempts to maintain its zero COVID strategy. The moment I really broke down was when I entered the cabin hospital. The condition was terrible. My roommate and I found two camp beds. There were only one restroom and one wash based on each floor. Many sleep next to each other. I was terrified. I broke down and cried. It's fair the Shanghai outbreak will spread and more cities will be put into lockdown. And New Zealand age group cricket player Luke Georgison has gone from playing for New Zealand to now potentially playing against them. The Wellington Firebirds batter who's played under 19s for Al Theroi and even featured for the Black Caps as a sub-fielder has signed a contract with Ireland cricket. The 22-year-old only realised he had an Irish passport three years ago. And after playing in Balfast in the off-season, he was noticed by selectors and earned one of the 13 contracts. The black caps are set to play the Irish later this year. The contract came through and it was sort of sitting there in front of me and I was like, wow, is this like actually happening? I honestly don't know how it would feel, but I think if I got the opportunity to play, it would be pretty bloody cool. I don't know what I'd do during the National Anthem, but yeah, I just, yeah, go out and give it a crack and just see how it goes. Go you, go you, take the opportunity. And taking a look at your weather this morning here is how your day is going to start out. It is a beautiful day today. Such a change from yesterday. Kaitaya, you're hitting a high of 21 degrees today. Fittiyanga, you will peak at 20 degrees today. It's a beautiful country. A beautiful country, it is actually, a beautiful sunny day for all. And moving down the country, and it's a similar story, you've got a sunny day for all. And moving down the country, and it's a similar story. You've got a sunny day for everybody. Those southerlies should also die out later today. You'll get a high of 17 degrees in Taupo. Gorgeous. And over to the east, you've got some morning cloud, which will clear for a parky fine day. And it's cooler in Danubek today. 15 degrees is a high for you. And down to the lower North Island. And it's just sun, sun, sun, everywhere. Bang, bang, bang. 18 degrees is the high in Levin and Palmerston North. You will get a bit of winds in Wellington this morning. 15 degrees will be your high in a lovely afternoon too. Tutsi wampo no means a South Island and it's a paki fine day here. You'll get some cloud rolling in later on today and high for Nouncing, Greymouth is 18 degrees. And down the coast, some possible morning fog for most of you here, but it will turn into a lovely fine day as you can see. 16 degrees is a high for Timuru, Oamaru and Othotokahi Christchurch. It's gorgeous, pretty much everywhere today. To the deep south, a sunny day for most of you. But if you're in Invercago or Rakiura-Steward Island, you can expect the odd shower. 19 degrees is a high for Oteapoti-Diniden. Thanks, Indira. You're welcome. Hey, you two are actually holding up really well. Can I just say this quickly? You two are holding out really well. Two o'clock this morning. You were up. Oh, yeah. You were up earlier at the airport, you too, sending our babies across. Were you at the airport chase? I was, yeah. I had to drop someone off before I came into work this morning for an international flight. So bizarre, driving to the international part of the airport. So bizarre. It is like a different world and there was no one there. There were like so many empty car parks. You were there at 2 a.m. I was there at 2 a.m. But they tell you four hours before your flight is the check-in now. You know, you're five, four hours. That's literally what it said on my booking. The people started lining up at about 2.30, and it was getting really busy. I will tell you, I know why it's four hours. There's just so much you have to fill out in terms of the documents. Yeah, true. You've got to get tests. The documents. And I felt so sorry for so many people who had no clue that they were supposed to sign all these forms on the internet and do this and that. And they hadn't done it. And a lot of our elderly, and honestly, it was really hard. That's probably why they say four hours, right? Well, go you too for showing up. Hey, really interesting chat with Sharon Zoner about the OCR being raised. And she was actually, one of the things she pointed out was that actually over the last couple of years, spending has actually been reasonably high with a lot of people, if you can. Even during a pandemic. And it got me thinking, I got home yesterday and my lovely, lovely fiancé. I love this story. Lovely wasn't the word he knew is about a half an hour ago. I love him. But he said, I've done something. And I said, what have you done? But he said, I've done something. And I said, what have you done? And he said, I've bought something. I said, what have you bought? A horse. A horse. And what was your response? I know that, look. It was you what? No, look, he had tentatively mentioned that he was looking at this horse. And it's not totally random. I know that look It was you what No look He had tentatively mentioned That he was looking at this horse And it's not totally random He spent a long portion of his life Before me Riding professionally So he loves horses But he hasn't owned one In a very long time And yeah Impulsed by Did you actually think that he would He would? No And you also don't have anywhere to put a horse, right? You live in an inner city apartment. I love you, Ryan. I love you. So the horse is going to another city, right? Correct. Yeah.

But that is not stopping some insurance companies from classing customers who seek help as high-risk claimants. You heard that right. A mystery shop by Consumer New Zealand found those who declared pre-existing mental health conditions could be denied coverage through mental health exclusion causes. For more, we're joined by Dr. Sheree Lacey from Consumer New Zealand. Morning to Sheree, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. Good morning. This is big stuff, really big stuff. You and I were talking about this in the ad break, and it blows my mind. But I wanted you to explain to people what it was that you were trying to ascertain here. Did you go in with an understanding of what might be happening? Yeah, we'd heard a few stories from consumers. They were getting excluded from particular mental health cover. If they had experienced any kind of mental health issues in the past or even mental distress of any kind. The research actually started when we were talking to one woman and she had had a tough time a few years ago. She was going through a marriage breakup. She'd gone to speak to her GP about getting some kind of help or seeking marriage counselling services. And she'd also to speak to her GP about getting some kind of help or seeking marriage counselling services. And she'd also experienced a period of workplace bullying and she'd talked to her GP about that too. Now a couple of years later, when she was sort of through the other side of that, she went to get some insurance and was really surprised when she found that there was a mental health exclusion placed on her policy. And it was because the insurance company had accessed those GP notes and deemed her high risk for mental illness, despite the fact that she'd never received any kind of diagnosis. So she was really surprised, and that prompted us to go on and try and figure out how widespread the issue is. So how widespread is this issue? What did you find? So you did almost like a mystery shopper for one of a better term kind of experiment, right? Yeah, we did. We did. So we asked a range of mystery shoppers to call up 14 insurance companies, each of whom had had previous experience with mental health or issues or mental distress of some kind to see whether they would have any kind of exclusion placed on their policy or any kind of stand-down period. And it was actually quite shocking what we found. We really found that there's pretty much a systemic failure in the insurance industry when it comes to dealing with any kind of mental illness of people. All 14 insurance companies issued blanket exclusions for mental health. Is that correct? Yep. For health insurance policies, yes. When it came to income in life, there were a range of different responses that we received, but health, yeah, do you have a blanket exclusion for any kind of mental illness. And there were admissions within the insurance industry as well, that that isn't good enough and that the insurance industry does need to sort of keep pace with, with first of all changing attitudes as well as knowledge about how we experience mental illness throughout our lives, and that it did need to sort of update its understanding of mental illness and mental health. Yeah. It makes me so, makes me really, really mad because this is a time when we had Mike King on the show the other day talking about the mental health crisis we have in this country at the moment, and we tell people all the time, if you're feeling low, if you're struggling, seek help. And then they're punished for doing the thing that we tell them that they need to do. Yep. And this is a big concern, right? Because everything we know about mental illness or trying to stay mentally well is that you reach out, you speak to somebody, you seek help. You do what you can to get yourself to a place of, you know, functioning ability in your day-to-day life. And what we're seeing is that people are actually too scared to seek help, for fear that it might come back to bite them later when they try to seek or try to get mental health, try to get insurance policies in place. So there is a big concern there. Yeah, it seems to me that there's two concerns. One, you pointed out, people might be afraid to seek help, even at a time where we're telling them, go and ask for help if you are struggling. Or people potentially lie on their insurance forms, right? Yeah, yeah. And if they do, that's automatically, if, you know, that gets found out, then that will automatically avoid the policy, even if they're not sort of seeking cover for something related to. Absolutely. And so neither circumstance is right or fair. So what needs to happen here? How do we get this right? Because something clearly needs to change. Yeah, something clearly needs to change. So one thing that it's happening is that the government are reviewing some of the rules around insurance contracts. And so they're seeking submissions up until the 4th of May on that. But it doesn't really tackle this particular issue. So what we'd like to see is, first of all, the insurance industry really working with medical professionals and mental health professionals to develop more nuanced understanding of mental health and actually update how they treat experiences of mental illness in their policies. We'd also like to see a ban on blanket mental health exclusions in insurance policies, particularly the health insurance policies. Yeah, because it strikes me that if people are asking for help, then they're actually in a much better position than those that aren't seeking help, are asking for help. Absolutely. Hey, Sheree. Yeah. Thank you so much for your time. We really, really appreciate it. And this is big stuff. And we're going to follow this up, I think. So this is, yeah, really, really appreciate your insight. That's Dr. Sheree Lacey from Consumer consumer New Zealand and I know a lot of you out there will have your own personal stories with this and if you feel like you can share them with us even if it's anonymous we would love to hear your experiences as well breakfast at tvncd.com or head to our Facebook page breakfast on one just ahead we are celebrating the country's best cricketers.

New Zealand's best cricketers are being celebrated this week at the annual awards. The full ceremony will be aired on TVNZ's Duke Channel on Saturday at 4 p.m. Well, this morning we're lucky enough to be joined by one of the winners. White Ferns and Otago Sparks batter Susie Bates, who claimed the Ruth Martin Cup for women's domestic batting Bates scored. Wait for it, 504 runs in the Super Smash competition, the most in both men's and women's competition. She joins us now live from Southampton. Morina, Susie, congratulations. How do you feel? Morina, Jenny Mae. Yeah, it's nice to have those awards, although we couldn't go to the award ceremony. It's nice to see it online to celebrate all the success that we've had this year. Yeah, beautiful, Susie. I note that one of the reasons, apart from kick and us, to be fair, that you won the award is because of your consistency, which we know as an athlete actually in everyday life, that that's actually hard to achieve. So did you do anything different this season that you have done in other seasons? It's funny because I actually started consistently bad for the season and I couldn't score any runs and sort of had a talk to consistently bad for the season and I couldn't score any runs and sort of had a talk to Craig coming at the time and just about, I guess, the mental side of batting and trusting my processes, which even though you've played until for a long, long time, you sometimes forget it. So once I sort of got into the swing of things and scoring some runs and just sticking to my processes, I was able to get on a bit of a role for the sparks. Yeah, brilliant. Go you good thing. Hey, you're in Southampton at the moment. So you've been travelling a lot. What are you doing in Southampton? And what's it been like travelling around? Yeah, we've got a bit of a break now since the White Ferns finished the World Cup. We don't sort of start again until the end of May. And my oldest brother lives in LA and he's just had a baby. So I visited my nephew and then I've popped over to the UK to visit some other friends and family and then I'll head back to New Zealand via Dubai for a tournament. They're running a tournament for the first time in Dubai which has 16s and a couple of the other New Zealand girls are playing as well. Brilliant. Hey, what is it actually like travelling though? Because, you know, for the rest of us who are stuck here, we want to indulge in your stories. To be fair, when I got on a flight from Auckland to LA and it was packed, I was very anxious, but it actually felt, apart from everyone wearing masks, back to normal. And I've managed to travel to LA and onto the UK COVID-free. So fingers crossed that it'll carry on. But, yeah, the airports were jam-packed and I was a little bit anxious because we've only travelled for the white ferns, you know, when there was no one else travelling and it was quite pleasant. But, yeah, all that can sound here. You talked about the World Cup. And, look, I don't want to go into it in too much detail but I do want to know whether you've had time to kind of reflect on what happened at that tournament because there was so much expectations on the team to make it through you know to the final semifinals but yeah have you had time to kind of digest what happened yes and no I think I've distracted myself catching up with some semifinals. But yeah, have you had time to kind of digest what happened? Yes, Anne, no, I think I've distracted myself catching up with family, but my brother took two nights to bring it up at the dinner table. He was nervous too to talk about it. But looking back, I guess we lost three close matches and we weren't good enough in the pivotal moments and that cost us making the semifinal. But I think we were just so proud of the support that we got from New Zealand. And I'll never forget the Eden Park match where we lost to England. But we got the ninth wicket in the run out. And it's the loudest crowd that I've ever experienced at a sporting event as an athlete. So although we didn't make the semis, we're women's cricket as a support we had. And I guess the genuine support that we had from the whole country. And I've had so many people, men, women, girls, boys stop and talk about the World Cup. So it is pretty special. It just would have been nice for that close game to be a semi-refinal. Yeah, yeah, it would have been. Hey, Susie, I love the fact that you are continuing to lead the way for the more mature athletes. And I'm just wondering, how much longer, obviously I'm not asking you to give us a date or when, but how much longer do you want to keep going at the international level? Yeah, it's funny. I was because this event and this World Cup, that was meant to be last year, was kind of everything that a group of us had been working towards. And I guess you hadn't really planned after that. It was gets that World Cup and then it got dragged out another year. But for me, I think with missing a lot of cricket with a shoulder injury and COVID, I feel kind of refreshed. And I sort of had 12 months where I absolutely loved my cricket because it had been taken away from me. So I still feel like I've got a little bit left in the tank. But when you get to your age, you know that the end's close to the start and someone can also take that decision out of your hands. But I'm just loving the environment. I'm loving where a woman's cricket's going. I want to be a part of all the exciting things that are coming up. And if my body can stay out there, I still think I've got at least another 12 months and then we'll recess after that. Of course you are. You're absolutely smashing it at the moment, sister. Hey, thank you so much for your time this morning. Congratulations on your well-deserved awards and travel safely and appreciate your time this morning, Susie. Thank you. No worries. Nice to see you. Thank you. No worries. Nice to see you. Thank you guys. Lovely to see you too. Susie Bates. Congratulations to you. It has just gone 7 o'clock, so here's in Dera with your news. Kieran Itte E. Popong is starting in the US. A suspect, sorry, and yesterday's New York subway shooting has been arrested. Frank R. James has been taken into custody, 24 hours after 10 people were shot in the Brooklyn station. 23 people were left injured from the two smoke grenades and gunfire that were unleashed on the train car. New York police say they stopped the suspect in the street. He was taken into custody without incident and has been transported to an NYPD facility. He will be charged with committing yesterday's appalling crime in Brooklyn. The police commissioner said hundreds of detectives were involved in the investigation. Now to Altheoro, the first time New Zealanders today are waking up to the orange traffic light setting just ahead of Easter. Masks, seating requirements and gathering limits inside hospitality venues have been scrapped. But face coverings are still enforced in retail settings on public transport and flights. The move into orange also means masks wearing at schools is now optional. Gisbon and the East Coast have been hit hard overnight by the remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Feli. State Highway 35 between Gisbon and Pothaka is closed due to flooding and downed trees. Many homes are still without power and in Gisbon sewage is now being pumped into the Turinganui River as the wastewater system struggles to cope. The council says it's highly diluted and the mayor is advising residents to play it safe today. We are asking everyone if you don't have to travel, just stay home stay dry, look after each other and like I've said before we've done this before, we'll do it again. Slow down and be patient this Easter. That's the message from police and waka kothahy after nine people were killed on our roads this time last year. It was the highest Easter death toll in over a decade and the Transport Agency is expecting significant traffic over the long weekend and asks drivers to leave plenty of time for their journey. The International Criminal Court has labelled Ukraine a crime scene following the shocking images of bodies left on the streets of Butcha. Meanwhile, an advisor to the mayor of Mariupol has denied Moscow's claims over a thousand Ukrainian Marines had surrendered to Russian forces. President Volotomizlensky is urging his Western allies to supply more weapons and ammunition as both sides prepare for a new attack. And the Wellington Phoenix have cemented their spot in the A-League's top six with a close win over Perth glory. A midfielder, Gail Sandoval, scoring the only goal to secure the Knicks, a 1-0 win. As McGarry cut inside for him, can't draw a defender, though. It deflects Central, and a deflected shot is in. Sandoval is the man. The Phoenix returned to Wellington on Sunday and take on the Central Coast Mariners. It wasn't a complete performance, but it was enough to get us over the line tonight to get the win, and the three points is massive for us, you know, moving forward towards the back end of the season. Like I said, the boys will be pretty excited heading to New Zealand and playing a couple of games over there. And taking a look at your weather this morning, it's going to be pretty good today, actually. Very different day to yesterday. So here's how your day is going to turn out, starting in the north. Look at that. It's beautiful. That's all I have to say, really. Sun's out everywhere. 20 degrees is the high in Auckland in Fittiyanga, Russell, 21 in Kaitaya and Fingare. Enjoy your day. And moving down the country, same vibes. Posi vibes everywhere for the weather this morning. And it's really great change from yesterday. All those southerlies should also die out later today. Taupo, you're going to get a high of 17 degrees. And crossing over to the East Morning Cloud. We'll clear for a Paki Fine Day, and it's cooler in Danny Burke today. 15 degrees is a high for you. You will get some lovely blue skies later on today, and you're going to need it. Take care out there, and don't forget State Highway 35 is closed today. Taumadanoi, New Plymouth, Funganoi, Parmesan, North Levin, Wellington, everyone's getting sun today. You've got some strong winds in Wellington this morning, but 15 degrees is a pretty lovely high. And Tui Tewaipoanamo, the South Island, it's a beautiful day here too. You will have some cloud rolling in later on in the day. 18 degrees is a high for Nelson and Greymouth, but those will be clear blue skies by the afternoon. Look at that sun. Down the coast, possible morning fog for most of you here. That will turn into a fine day. As you can see, 16 degrees is a high for Timuru or Amaru and Ototahi Christchurch. Into the deep south. It's pretty much a gorgeous day here too. But if you're in the Cargol or Rakeira, Stuart Island, you can expect the odd shower. You can also see some cloud hanging you about there. It's 16, 17 degrees. Those are your highs today. 19 degrees is the highest temp in this region. That is you, Daneda. You'll be peaking at 19 degrees today. Enjoy your day, Al-Therra. Tena, co, eh-ho. It is six minutes past seven. As we've heard in Endera's news this morning, we're in for an orange Easter after shifting from the red traffic light setting to the orange overnight. But it can be a bit tricky to try and keep up with the changing rules, so here's our Wellington reporter, Abby Wakefield, with what you need to know. Just in time for Easter, we're moving from red to orange. So what does this mean for you? Well, there are no longer any gathering limits for indoor or outdoor venues and you no longer need to wear a mask to visit your favourite restaurant, bar, cafe or club. But you will need to wear one when you go on public transport, visit the supermarket, visit a retail store or an aged care facility. Ultimately, it's a question of volume. There are going to be a lot more people in the supermarket on a weekly basis and there'll be out and about passing on a dance floor. Under Orange, face masks aren't a requirement at schools anymore either. However, the government is encouraging it. So with our daily COVID-19 cases still in the thousands, why are we moving to Orange now? Right across the country, the evidence is clear that the actions we have sustained to mean that we're now coming off the peak, and we're now well on the other side of it. The move, a huge relief for businesses, now able to operate to full capacity. It'll be nice to go places with lots of people. I decided to be able to go have a beer with more than five mates, you know? I know people who've got bars and cafes, and it's very awkward for them, so I'm very happy for them. I thought we were already in green. Some healthy experts think the mask rules are too relaxed for schools, and others think staying at red for a few more weeks would make the move to winter easier on our healthcare system. We still need some health measures just to slow things down so that we can keep operating and keeping ourselves safe above all. I have to wear a mask for eight hours a day anyway, so I'm used to it now. As for what some of our politicians think. The mask rules have got very confusing. Let's just have a few basic things around masking and isolation periods, let's move forward. We've just passed 500 deaths in this country, which two years ago would have been completely unacceptable. So it does feel like a strange time to be stepping down the traffic light levels. We are strapped in the back waiting at the broken traffic light, asking when we can finally be free. For now, enjoy an orange Easter. And don't forget to have a plan in place for the long weekend, just in case you get COVID-19. Abby Wakefield with that report. Also, Abby mentioned it's goodbye to mask wearing in most places, including our schools. That's despite the government still encouraging the use of them in classrooms. The advice can sound a little confusing, so for more on the best way to protect our tamariki heading into winter, we're joined by community and developmental pediatrician Dr. Jin Russell. Morena, Dr Russell, lovely to see you. Okay, so basically from today's school kids from year four upwards don't have to wear masks. Where do you sit on that? I mean, even though it's not mandatory anymore for children to be wearing master schools, it is still strongly recommended. It's strongly encouraged, and that's the language that's used by the Ministry of Education. And I think that is really evidenced advice. Yeah, I love what you wrote on Twitter and I want to go through each of these steps because I think it's actually really important as a reminder to us about the importance of mask wearing and obviously in this particular case talking about our kids in school. So the first point that you made are that masks are about source, is a source of control. That's right. So we wear masks and this is something that I think children and young people need to understand in schools as well. We wear masks to protect one another. They're about source control. So wearing a mask, what it means is that if you happen to be the person who has COVID-19 in the classroom, you're much less likely to spread that onwards to your friends and to the teacher. And so far, I guess, and this is another point that you made too, about kids wearing masks, is that they've been doing it up until this point. So they're already in that mode, right? That's right. Yes, and I expect that Auckland students in year four and up will be absolute ninjas with wearing masks by now because we've been doing it for a long time. I think it's easier to keep good habits going as we head into winter rather than to shop and change. And that inconsistency can be confusing for families. But at the moment, lots of schools have had great mask wearing cultures. Kids are in a good habit. And as we head into winter, and it might be a particularly difficult winter for us this year, I think it's a really good thing to keep doing. Yeah, can you talk us through that? Because we have heard on a number of occasions from different health experts on this program about the winter that is about to hit us with the internet, with our borders, opening, etc. So in terms of mask wearing and winter, why is that important? Yeah, absolutely. So this winter might be particularly difficult for New Zealand. We have influenza potentially coming back across the border. And winter is often a time when viruses thrive because we spend more time indoors. Winter usually stretches our thin healthcare system. And so for this year, it does seem to be really prudent to keep wearing masks in schools because they are just an important layer of our strategy, our COVID-19 strategy in schools, whether they're mandated or not. We've also had conversations here about our immunocompromised. And again, and this is a point that you brought up again on Twitter, about that's what mask wearing is also about. It's about showing someone else that you care about them, right? That's right. So even though our vaccination levels are increasing in a certain proportion of the population are gaining immunity now, even after having infection, there are vulnerable and at-risk people in our community. And by wearing masks, we're going to try, we're going to reduce the level of COVID-19 spread in schools, which is really important that we take care of each other, especially those who are most at risk. I think the other part of this too is our healthcare system, right? Yeah, correct. So, you know, if children are going out and catching a lot of COVID-19, they can bring that home, and there can be more at-risk people at home as well. So we don't want that to happen. All right. So if we had principals, because the thing is that even though we have changed the traffic light systems, this is the choice that schools have to make, right? Whether they allow their children not to wear masks or continue to make it compulsory. So if you had the opportunity to speak to principals who may be watching or school leaders who are watching, what would you say to them? I'd say this is a small cost that we can keep going through winter to take care of each other, especially those who are most at risk. Masks are a simple and effective thing to do, and they're just an important layer for us. Of course, schools should keep up doing other things as well, improving ventilation, working on that. That's so important. And also ensuring that we keep vaccinating, even if you've had on McCron already. It's so important to complete your vaccination course. Yeah. One thing I do want to bring up is that yesterday, Chris Hickens, the Minister for COVID, did talk about mask wearing, prolonged mask wearing, being somewhat challenging for schools. I mean, that is a valid point, right? Yes, absolutely. And as a developmental pediatrician, I think about this a lot. And that is one of the reasons why we wouldn't advise masking very young children. But, you know, what we're talking about here is keeping a good habit going through winter for good reason. And then it can be reassessed. We're not talking about masking children in all settings, just indoors while they're at school. And there's lots of opportunities for mask-free time outside of classrooms. Yeah, true story, Dr. Jin, it's lovely to have you in this morning. Lovely to see you. Really appreciate your time. Kea-rah. Dr Jin Russell from Starship. Thank you so much. Stay with us. COVID-19 Minister Chris Hipkins is standing by to respond. What is this? These renowned restorers can fix anything. I've never done anything like this before. Almost anything. It's not just a piece of ward, it's a piece of my childhood. Ooh, no pressure. Well, you just want to do it break it?

Followed by the Great British Sewing Bee. Good Friday from 7 on 1. Now is the perfect time for SME operators to get expert advice on a tax plan for the new financial year. Bookkeepers and accountants are in a much better place to be offering advice and helping SMEs reduce their tax bill if they can implement a 12-month strategy. These are uncertain times, but international trends suggest its likely COVID-19 restrictions will be eased in the coming months, which may change the way your business operates. Getting expert advice to decide on a tax strategy and work out an implementation plan, while digitising as much of your bookkeeping as possible, can make a business more productive and secure. Ultimately, it could save SME operators time, stress and money at the end of the next financial year. With zero, paying bills is almost as fun as this.

Dilma's premium extra strength tea. You'd fade. Love forever, love is free. Let's turn forever. You and me. Welcome back to brief this. We're just waiting for the covered response minister, Chris Hapkins, to join us. He's just standing by. But we have been enjoying your feedback this morning about impulse. Impulse buying, sorry. Because Maddie's fiancé, Brian. Bore a horse. Bore a horse. As you do. And just said, guess what I bought? Just casually, yeah. Emma, during my last pregnancy, one, half a boat. Two, a piano that needed to be picked up the same day. Three, free yucca plants too big to fit in the car. I love this. I love this from Duncan. He said, hi, hi, team, this is absolutely true. I used to live in England, and one Saturday Saturday morning my father just popped out to get a loaf of bread and some milk and was gone for ages. We were all getting a bit concerned about where he was. The shop was just around the corner. He finally came home two hours later to announce he'd just bought a house with two acres. Go dad. Go dad. Apparently it did turn out for the best but still, it would be quite the shock. I love it. Bruce him and his wife went looking for a car instead. Well, Ute, actually. Instead, they bought his beautiful wife a car. Oh, that's good. First, you could give our Harvisa on my hand. Tips. Wendy, I said a cooking pot that cost about $6,000. And that was 20 years ago. So there would have been some pretty fancy schmancy cooking box. I love this. I'm going to try and condense it, but it's a really funny one by Al, his impulse by, basically went to a garage sale, saw an oven that was never been used in great condition, going really cheap, knew he could not afford it. The only money he had on him was the rent money. So he just, you know, he's like, right, I'm going to make an executive decision, bought it, took it home, lugged it all the way back, took it to his wife, and his wife looked at it and said, this is a gas stove and we're not on gas. So he desperately tried to take it back to the guy he bought it off, and the guy was like, sorry, mate, no can do. Why do you think I sold it in the first? So the same guy had done what he'd done. He bought a gas stove and he had no gas, so. Brilliant. Yeah. So we're talking impulse buys. I don a gas stove and he had no gas. Brilliant. So we're talking impulse buys. I don't think I'm in, I don't think that I am an impulse buy, although my husband seems to think. Would your husband agree with that? Yeah, very, very differently. Although if you take me into a bedding shop, I can't help but buy blankets. I do have a bit of a thing for blankets. A thing for blankets. And where do they go? In the cupboard. Never to be seen again. Hey, we'll keep your feedback coming in. We love hearing about it. Breakfast at TVNZ.com. OnZ or head to our Facebook page, Breakfast on 1. It's 21 minutes past 7. Before the break, Dr. Jin Russell was explaining how it will still be good to keep mask wearing up at our schools heading into winter. That's despite the government dropping the requirement yesterday. So, joining me to respond to Dr Russell's comments and explain the government's decision that led to some very confusing mask rule chats yesterday as COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins. Moydena Minister, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. Good morning. Hey, ultimately, what drove you do you think to the decision to switch to Orange? What was the big deciding factor? The overall shape of the pandemic and what we're seeing in New Zealand at the moment. We know that we have come through a peak. There's clear evidence that we're on the downward side of a peak. So the number of daily cases has been declining, a number of hospitalisations has been declining, a number of people in ICU are still relatively stable, but looks like it might be starting to trend down a little bit. There's often, you know, we fully expect that there'll be a lag time between the number of cases declining and the impact of that on our health system. But we are starting to see the early signs that, you know, things are turning down there. Is that everywhere though? Is everywhere through the peak? Or is that just in some centres? Because I know case numbers are still, we're still getting thousands of cases a day. And there has not been a day in a month where we didn't record a death from COVID. It's not completely uniform across the country. One of the things that we do look at is how the health system as a whole is geared up to be able to cope with that. So we've seen the hospitals working together, for example, to transfer people where they need to take pressure off one hospital and there's a bit of capacity in another hospital. So we do weigh all of that up as well when we're making these decisions. Your press conference yesterday, rather than providing clarity, possibly just created a bit more confusion around mask wearing. So can you confirm for us this morning what the rules are around mask wearing in orange? Yeah, look, I acknowledge that yesterday was a bit of a shocker. I made a mistake in my introductory remarks and then got a bit flustered and made it worse. Bad day at the office. In terms of the mask use requirements, there is clarity there, and there's a rationale for why it's different and in a different environment. So it is still required if you're going into those public places like retail, like going to a museum, shopping mall, etc. And there's a rationale for that. People need to be able to go to many of those places as part of their day-to-day lives. There will be elderly people there. There will be people who are immunocompromised. And we've all got a responsibility and a duty there around making sure that we're protecting each other. A nightclub is a different environment. A bar or a nightclub or a restaurant, that's a different environment. People are making a choice to be there. They don't necessarily have to be there. They're going to be eating and drinking and potentially dancing and doing other things that you do in an environment like that. And mask use is, A, not practical. But B, we have to acknowledge that there will be fewer people doing that and they're making a choice to do that. Yeah, although they're still crammed into a really small place and then potentially spreading it throughout the community. And look, people will make those decisions when they make the decision to go into a nightclub, a bar, a restaurant, we do so with our eyes wide open. We know exactly what it is that we're, you know, we're doing there. Yeah, except those decisions do impact on other people within the community, right? Of course they do. And, you know, overall, what we're trying to do is manage a balance of risk here. So we do want to keep the trend pointing downwards. That's one of the best ways that we can keep people safe. There are no magical answers here. We try and get the balance right. Right. So what's the balance then in terms of not requiring masks at schools? Because to me, that would have seemed like a no-brainer to keep that going. We had Dr. Jin Russell on talking to Jenny May just before the break, who said, realistically, it's not really that hard to us kids who have already been doing this for the last couple of years to continue to wear masks in that environment. Well, the feedback we've had from schools is that actually it has been incredibly difficult and they have found this very challenging. In what way? Well, young people, it's not easy to get them to wear masks and to get them to wear masks consistently. But we have to acknowledge that schools are in different positions. So some schools will have had a significant peak in COVID-19 cases and they'll be out the other side of that. Others are right in the midst of that. So we're not saying that mask use is and justified in schools, we absolutely encourage it and schools do have the ability to require it. So where a school feels that for the circumstances of their community, it's something that they want to keep that requirement in place. They are absolutely able to do that. I don't know. It just seems to me, Minister, that you know, you talk about schools saying it's tough to get teenagers to wear masks. It's tough to get teenagers to do a lot of things, but we get them to do it anyway, because that is life. Yeah, look, and ultimately schools can make decisions about whether they're going to continue to ask their young people to wear masks. I'd certainly encourage school students to wear masks where that's practical. And, you know, that's our message across the board, really, which is mask use has a significant role in turning down the spread of the virus. It can reduce transmission of the virus by up to 50%. And so in those environments where it's no longer required, but potentially desirable, we'd encourage people to do that. And, you know, I walk around Wellington. At lunchtime, I go out and get a bit of fresh year. There's still a lot of Wellingtonians wearing masks and places where they don't need to because, you know, they're doing that out of courtesy to others, and I really encourage that. All right. Just really quickly before we go, Minister, what's the next decision that needs to be made? What's the next phase look like? We continue to monitor for another couple of weeks. We'll have another check in early May and then another check in in mid-May where we look at the overall where case numbers are going, where hospitalisation is going and so on. Big push at the moment is always, is if you haven't been vaccinated or you haven't been boosted to go out and do that. We acknowledge that things are a bit static there at the moment and one of the reasons our vaccination rates have plateaued a bit is you have to have a three-month gap between getting COVID-19 and getting a vaccination. And there's a lot of people in that category at the moment. So we do expect that there'll be a bit of a quiet zone in vaccination. But vaccination, for those who haven't had COVID and who haven't been vaccinated or haven't been boosted, now it's a great time to do it. Perfect. Hey, thank you so much for your time. As always, we really appreciate it. That is COVID-19 response minister Chris Hipkins. Thank you. Stay with us. We'll be right back with your 730 news after the break. Is coffee guilty?

Gathering limits, masks and seating requirements have now been scrapped for hospitality venues. The relaxation of rules comes as Al-Theriro operates under the orange traffic light setting from today. Face coverings are still enforced in retail settings on public transport and also flights, but they are now optional in schools. COVID-19 response Minister Chris Hickin says the rules are clear despite some confusion. Ultimately, schools can make decisions about whether they're going to continue to ask their young people to wear masks. I'd certainly encourage school students to wear masks where that's practical and that's our message across the board really, which is mask use has a significant role in turning down the spread of the virus. But paediatrician Dr. Jin Russell says now is not the time to drop masks in schools. This winter might be particularly difficult for New Zealand. We have influenza potentially coming back across the border. And winter is often a time when viruses thrive because we spend more time indoors. Winter usually stretches our thin healthcare system. And so for this year, it does seem to be really prudent to keep wearing masks in schools because they are just an important layer. The International Criminal Court has labelled Ukraine a crime scene following the shocking images of bodies left on the streets of Butcha. Meanwhile, an advisor to the mayor of Mariupol has denied Moscow's claims. Over a thousand Ukrainian Marines had surrendered to Russian forces. Journalist Bruno Beekman is in Kiev and says the situation in the capital has not returned to normalcy, but forces are readying for a new attack. I wouldn't call it back to normality here. We still have the odd three to four sirens a day. And we just heard from the Russian Ministry of Defense that they have warned that the Ukrainian military is launching might launch attacks on Russian territory and in that case Russia will have no choice but to attack the central command in central Kiev. President Volodomizelensky is urging his Western allies to supply more weapons and ammunition. Shanghai's 25 million residents are now in a second week of lockdown with the situation growing more desperate. Chinese officials have admitted they're struggling to feed everyone, with people in the city only allowed to order in food or wait for government deliveries. Tens of thousands of people are being forced into government quarantine as cases surge and Beijing attempts to maintain its zero COVID strategy. The moment I really broke down was when I entered the cabin hospital. The condition was terrible. My roommate and I found two camp beds. There were only one restroom and one wish based on each floor. Many sleep next to each other. I was terrified. I broke down and cried. It's feared the Shanghai outbreak will spread and more cities will be put into lockdown. The death toll in the South African province of Kwa Zulu Natal has reached 250 after extreme flooding in the region. Intense rainfall since Monday has seen some areas experience a month's worth of rain in a single day. Mud size have trapped people under buildings and the provincial government has warned fatalities could rise further with more flooding expected. Entire homes have been swept away in the region's main city, Durban, and South Africa's biggest logistics and freight operator Transnet has suspended operations due to extensive damage to roads. And in sport, Liverpool have extended their aggregate lead against Portuguese side Benfica in the second leg of the European Championship quarterfinals. The Reds opening the scoring 20 minutes of the European Championship quarterfinals. The Reds opening the scoring 20 minutes into the match and lead 1-0. Liverpool are now ahead of a net again. Liverpool are now ahead 4-1 on aggregate. Meanwhile, Manchester City have a slim 1-0 lead over Spanish side, Athletico, Madrid, on aggregate, but remains scoreless in the first half. And New Zealand age group cricket player Luke Georgison has gone from playing for New Zealand to now potentially playing against them. The Wellington Firebirds batter who played under-19s for Alpero and even featured for the Blackcaps as a subfielder has signed a contract with Ireland cricket. The 22-year-old only realised he had an Irish passport three years ago. And after playing in Belfast in the off season, he was noticed by selectors and earned one of the 13 contracts. The black caps are set to play the Irish later this year. The contract came through and it was sort of sitting there in front of me and I was like, wow, is this like actually happening? I honestly don't know how it would feel, but I think if I got the opportunity to play, it would be pretty bloody cool. I don't know what I'd do during the National Anthem, but yeah, I just go ahead and give it a crack to see how it goes. Not pretty cool to have options. Taking a look at your weather this morning and we are starting in the north and honestly, it's pretty gorgeous today. Look, it's fine out here for all of you. Just some southerlies throughout the day but I don't think you're going to notice it much with a clear blue sky. It's 21 degrees as a high for Kaitaya and Fungare. And moving down country, it's a similar vibe through here. It's a sunny day for everyone. Those southerlies should also die out later today. You've got a high of 17 degrees in Taupo. Gorgeous weather. Over to the east, morning cloud will clear for a paki fine day and it's cooler today. You've got 15 degrees as a high in Danubeg. And to the lower North Island and look at that gorgeous sun. Just some fresh southerlies bringing those cooler temps in the capital today. 15 degrees is the high there. Levin, you will get as low as 7 degrees today, so will you, Taumiranoi, but otherwise it's clear blue skies for you too. Tu Te Waipo Nami, the South Island, and it's a pucky fine day here. You've got some cloud rolling in later on in the day, and 18 degrees is a high for Nelson and Grey Mouth. And down the coast, you get some possible morning fog for almost everybody here, and that will turn into a lovely fine day. 16 degrees is a high for Timuru, Oamaru, and Othotahe, Christchurch. When you'll get as low as zero degrees in Alexandra today, 18 degrees is your high, Alexandra. And now to the deep south, a sunny day for almost everybody. But if you're in Invercargo, Rakiya-Ura-Sooid Island, you can expect the odd shower. 19 degrees is a high for Ote Poti de Nidin. Gore in Queensland will get as low as two degrees today. Tempts are definitely cooler. Looking ahead to a good Friday, and this is good Easter Egg treasure hunt weather. You'll be glad to know. It's a nice start to the long weekend for almost everybody across the Motu. A few showers in the south, westland and Fiordland that will develop to rain in the evening. But then on Saturday, mostly fine in the North Island. A bit of a mixed bag for the south. But some of you might be welcoming the relief of that rain. Nice, thank you, Indira.

Lewis All has made a massive impact on Al Thao Tawro in New Zealand, both on the sports field as a member of both the Silver Ferns and the Black Ferns. And for the past 14 years as a Labour Party member of Parliament where she fought for and got marriage equality for same-sex couples over the board, closed a loophole for revenge porn offenders, helped ban female genitalia mutilation and introduce safe zones around abortion clinics. Today she gives her valedictory speech prior to leaving Parliament to take up a new role that will continue her passionate advocacy for marginalised groups. And this morning, we couldn't be more delighted to welcome her back to breakfast to talk about her achievements to date and also look forward to her new challenge. Morena Lou, how are you? Morena J May, and g? Morninga J. Mae, and my mihi or parakuhi Fanao and Tena Kautaua. It's a good day, Jenny May. It's a good day to reflect on some of the that we've been able to achieve in the last 14 years and to look to the future into the next role that I will be taking being a champion for Wahene and also our rainbow community in the Pacific to the future and to the next role that I will be taking, being a champion for Wahine and also our rainbow community in the Pacific and internationally. So I think it's a good co-papa to move on to after the wonderful experiences I've had here in Parliament. Atahua, it's beautiful. I want to take you back to 2008 when you first went into politics and I want to know if back to 2008 when you first went into politics. And I want to know if you can remember back then, what were you like then in terms of what were your hopes and dreams when you came into politics? Oh, my hopes and dreams have always been to be a good representative. And as you know, the honour of representing your country in any sphere is a privileged position. And I've always wanted to use my privileged position to represent us, our values, what we stand for, fighting against inequality, fighting against discrimination, and making sure that all voices were heard here in Tefariparimata. And so I hope through my practice of politics, people have seen that I've only ever put the people who are here to serve at the centre of everything that I've tried to do. Okay, so reflecting on those 14 years then, Lou, with so much hope and optimism when you first came into politics, are you leaving politics feeling the same way? I am in terms of how I've engaged. I can still look at myself in the mirror, Jay May, and I think we can smile at each other and nod to each other and say, look, we did everything we could. We learnt the playbook. We were prepared, and we represented the issues that we were passionate about from a position of evidence, from a position of, I think, representing the needs and aspirations of communities that particularly historically have been ignored and have been criminalised if you look at our rainbow community. So the fact that I had the privilege of being able to impact and drive through law reform with colleagues here in Parliament, I mean, I can't, I couldn't, I wouldn't change anything for the world. I want to look at the last week or so, Lou. And I guess my question, and a question for a lot of others too is why aren't you going quietly? Now I know you and I know that that's not who you are but wouldn't it have been easy to tow the party line? I think that I speak to an honesty and transparency in everything that I do Jenny Mae and I'm happy to answer the questions always and I'm a real person and I have shared some of my her story and I think actually I have a responsibility to share the realities of politics and I'm happy to do that so I suppose I will always use my waha in a way that I believe the realities of politics. And I'm happy to do that. So I suppose I will always use my waha in a way that I believe is about enhancing democracy and enabling people to understand the purpose of this place. And obviously, I'm not going to take away from my disappointment and not continuing on and being the MP for Manurewa. I mean, that didn't happen at the last election. I then took a list position, but I think the public deserve a bit more than not full disclosure. And so when you say, should I leave quietly, this is my life and has been my life. And as always, I'm happy to share that journey with Aotearo in New Zealand. Lou, this seems to be an odd question to be putting to you given the amounts that you've actually achieved but do you think you could have achieved more if you'd played the political game to play by the rules in order to be part of Cabinet? No, I don't actually. I think that I've done what Mayatu put me in here to do, which is to be a spokesperson for those communities that have historically been marginalized as minorities haven't had the political will for some of our issues to be addressed. You talked about female genital mutilation. You know, that was an 11-year process for our ethnic women communities and for them to be vulnerable enough and really clear that they needed our help. I mean, I wouldn't change that piece of legislation for anything. Marriage equality, the same. You're talking about activists who since the 70s had been fighting for our equal rights and for the laws, the archaic colonised laws in our country to be changed. So my time in this place has been about that, been about achieving those legislative reforms on behalf of the people that I've been very clear that I represent. I'm a proud takatapui, manah wahena, I'm proud, cis woman, I'm proud to talk about issues like period poverty and the fact that there's too much violence in our country and to highlight these issues and then to do something about it. So that's really what matters, I think. It's how you use the role for good. And so in terms of could I have done other things, of course, but as I said before, I'm leaving satisfied about my contribution to New Zealand society by virtue of the privilege of being a member of Parliament. Gosh, I'm all of a sudden overwhelmed with sadness, Lou, because, you know, I mean, for 14 years you have been a voice for those who haven't had a voice, and we're losing that voice in Parliament today with you going. But you have a big afternoon, you deliver your speech. How long did it take you to write? And what is the wairua? What's the spirit of your speech this afternoon? Oh, the wadu of my speech will be one of clarity. As I said before, I will take the opportunity to put some things on record that I think need to be known. But it will be one of absolute gratitude in terms of the people that I have had the opportunity to work with, those pioneers, the people that have, as I said before, for 30, 40 years championed pieces of legislation that I've had the privilege at this time in place to help lead. And Dame Margaret Sparrow, I will highlight her legacy. I mean, the work that she's done in sexual and reproductive health, and it's really satisfying knowing that now women will be protected when they access to health service, and practitioners won't be abused in the practice of the clinical skills that they have. But it's only been because of people like Dame Margaret that we have a fit for purpose now legislative regime that's really clear that we have bodily autonomy, we have the right to access to health service and to do so safely. So that's what I'll talk about, is about all the people that have helped me on my journey, and in fact they are the drivers of the law reform, and I've been privileged at this point in time, to, I guess, complete some of the work that they started. Lou, Maddie just would like to say a couple of words before we wrap this interview up. Yeah, just really quickly, Lou, you know, I've been talking a lot recently about my engagement and I'm sure people are sick of hearing about it. But, you know, in amongst all of the craziness of planning a wedding, I've been really reflecting lately on the fact that 10 years ago I wouldn't have been able to do this. God, Jenny Mays, you like the cry on our show. And so I just wanted to say thank you. I wanted to say thank you on behalf of our community. And I know there are a lot of people behind the scenes. It wasn't just you. There was a massive team that made that happen. But yeah, I just wanted to say thank you for your strength and for your work as well because you got us the rights that we so deserved that everyone else had. And so I wouldn't be planning a wedding if it wasn't for you and for the team, Lou. So thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Well, can I say to you, Mady, I love you, love your work, and I'm really proud of you. You are a role model for our community. And actually, you are just you. You project who you are, this loving guy who can talk to anybody. And I think it matters for our young people, that they see you on television, that they see MPs in Parliament who are part of our rainbow community. And just care care to all of us. We have a right to stand in our own mana anywhere in Aaltearo in New Zealand. And so all the best for the wedding. And thank you so much for the aroha that you've shown me today. Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your tenacity. Thank you for your strengths. And making this a better country, Lou. Go well in your next chapter. And kha, kha, kamaa, this afternoon when you deliver your final speech in the house, love to you. Thanks so much, Lou. Beautiful to see you. We will be back with your 8 o'clock news shortly.

It produces radiant heat rays that heat you directly, and you won't believe the cost savings. This standard outdoor gas heater costs around $3.50 per hour to run. But the energy efficient TiVo instant indoor outdoor heater, with its built-in motion sensors, only costs around 40 cents per hour to run. That's a saving of around $3.10 per hour. And it never runs out of gas at the wrong time. Plus it's 100% weatherproof. So it's not affected by rain or wind. In a standardised wind test with a 15 kilometres an hour breeze, the TiVo heater measures a full 10 degrees warmer than the outdoor gas heater, even in real life conditions. When it gets really cold, you can take it indoors to create summer in your bedroom or your bathroom. Tivo heater is an affordable and efficient way to heat your entire home with its built-in motion sensors that automatically shut off when you leave one room and turn on when you enter another.

Oh, it looks good, Tess. Mordina team. Yes, that's right. This here behind us is our good friend Peter. And this here beside me is my good friend Matt from Auckland Museum. Here to tell us all about this great T-Rex behind us. So Peter, why, I'm Matt, sorry, not Peter, why is this such an exciting get for the museum? It's a very exciting moment for the museum in New Zealand. Peter is the first Tyrannosaurus for Xkeleton to ever be on display in Otero. Wow. And he's pretty damn unique. You can see he's very large, very large, and black. There's actually very few Terex fossils in the world, only about 40. And Peter is one of four completely black Terex fossils. Right, and how did he end up that way, I guess? Well, when Peter was found in Wyoming, only in 2018, and 66, 67 million years ago when he was alive, he died and his bones were turned into fossils by minerals leaching into the bones over millions of years. The type of minerals that did leach in there were black. So it's a pretty amazing looking Yeah and it definitely adds to Peter's scariness one would say. It's been a bit of a journey to get Peter here right right, with COVID and whatnot. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, like everything in the world, freight's just going crazy, and Peter's come from Europe. We were incredibly lucky that a private benefactor loved what the museum was doing and wanted Peter to go on display for the first time ever. Wow. So he's come from Germany, but there's been delay after delay. He was supposed to arrive last week. Customs, shipping delays. In fact, he only arrived two days ago. Wow. Well, I've just got to say, I'm very happy that Peter's with us now. Everyone stick with us because coming up, Matt's going to teach us a little bit more about what Peter's skeleton tells us about the prehistoric age. Brilliant. Nice test. Just really quickly before we get to Enderio's News, how long did it take? us a little bit more about what Peter Skelaton tells us about the prehistoric age. Brilliant. Nice, Tess. Just really quickly before we get to Ender's News, how long did it take them to put it all together, Tess? Because it's very interesting, I imagine. I should ask, how long did this all take to put together? Literally, we started yesterday morning. You did it in a day? Yeah. Brilliant. It arrived yesterday morning, and they did condition checking yesterday, and the team put did it in a day. Yeah. Brilliant. It arrived yesterday morning and they did condition checking yesterday and the team put him together pretty much yesterday. Oh my God. Yeah. A lot. Yeah. Crops to Auckland Museum and last night on 6 o'clock we actually did a story on this guy but he didn't have his head on. But now that you see it, honestly. First time saying the head. Yeah. My sons are going to go off about that. They love dinosaurs. We'll check back in with you a little bit later on, Tess. Thank you so much. It looks amazing. Yeah. Right, it's just gone 8 o'clock. Here's Endera with your news. Kiyaharanam. For the first time, New Zealand is a waking up to the orange traffic light setting just ahead of Easter. Masks, seating requirements and gathering limits inside hospitality venues have been scrapped, but face coverings are still enforced in retail settings on public transport and flights. The move into orange also means mask wearing at schools is now optional. It does seem like the peak of the Omicron cases are over and hospitalisations have stabilized. So that combined with, I guess, the population feeling that they really want to move on, that's probably the right time to move now. The Reserve Bank has lifted the official cash rate to 1.5% due to rapidly rising inflation. It's the biggest single jump in over 20 years, ANZ's chief economist Sharon Zolner says inflation affects everybody. So if the Reserve Bank can just throw sand in the gears of that inflation process, make homeowners, for example, just pull the heads in just a little bit more, spend a bit less, it'll become that much harder for firms to pass on the gears of that inflation process. Make homeowners, for example, just pull the heads in just a little bit more, spend a bit less. It'll become that much harder for firms to pass on the cost increases, which is not fun for them, but someone's got to wear it. And today, Labour MP Louisa Wall gives her valedictory speech as she leaves Parliament to take up a new role. It comes after she claimed that Prime Minister Dessinda Adirne said she would never be a minister in her cabinet. I will take the opportunity to put some things on record that I think need to be known. But it will be one of absolute gratitude in terms of the people that I have had the opportunity to work with. Overseas now on a suspect in yesterday's New York subway shooting I have had the opportunity to work with. Overseas now in a suspect in yesterday's New York subway shooting has been arrested. Frank R. James has been taken into custody 24 hours after 10 people were shot in the Brooklyn station. 23 people were left injured from the two smoke grenades and gunfire that were unleashed on the train car. New York police say they stopped the suspect in the street. He was taken into custody without incident and has been transported to an NYPD facility. He will be charged with committing yesterday's appalling crime in Brooklyn. The police commissioner said hundreds of detectives were involved in the investigation. And 180,000 people in the besieged city of Maripo currently have no safe evacuation corridors to get out. Ukraine says the two last remaining units in Maripo have been able to link up, increasing their resistance against Russia. The BBC's Tom Bateman has been following those displaced from Mariupo. State TV in Moscow showed these unverified pictures, claiming they are Ukrainian soldiers surrendering. But the city's defenders posted their own videos hold up in the port and a factory, still fighting, but their position seems desperate. We won't give up, says this Marine, but we're encircled with no resupply of ammunition or food. A hundred miles north, just over the Russian line, Europe's 21st century war is fought amid mud and rage in the trenches. Maripol's capture could see a push north here. If Mariupo falls, what will happen here? Well, we won't let this place turn into Mariupil. They're holding on. Vitali shows me their Soviet era launches. They also have brand new Western weapons, but they want more, with the war about to move to a decisive phase. They've been entrenched for 45 days. We are on our own soil. We expect them to bury as many of them as possible. The more troops they send our way, the more fertile our land gets. Russia's siege has killed thousands of civilians in Maripal and unleashed an appalling struggle for survival for residents that remain. Whole lives are packed into a few bags, and they carry the fresh horrors of this war. Lena and Timothy are homeless, their apartment block obliterated in an airstrike. Ukraine's leaders called Mariupol the heart of their war effort, but they fear soon it could stop beating. And now in sports news, Liverpool remain in control of their second-league European Champions League quarter-final match. The Reds opening the scoring in the 20th minute through Ibrahim-Kanate. Benfica and the header is into the back of a net again from Kanata he's done it again Benfica answering back before half time the score won all though Liverpool lead 4-2 on aggregate in the morning's other match and Manchester City remains scoreless in their second leg match against Athletico Madrid but holds a 1-0 lead on aggregate. I think one day we'll get our cameraman Steph to come in and explain what aggregate means for the top me so long to figure out this morning but it is really fascinating. Let's take a look at your weather this morning. Here is how your day is going to turn out. It's going to be a much better day than it was yesterday. So you can definitely hang out your washing today. Kaitai, you're looking at a high of 21 degrees and so are you Fengare. It's clear blue skies everywhere here. And moving down the country, similar vibes, posse vibes, as we like to say here on breakfast. The sun is out, the sun is smiling. The southerlies are there, but they should also die out later on today. Taupo you will get a high of 17 degrees. And over to the East Coast, which is the region that was hit hard by the remnants of a cyclone filly, but today is going to be much better for you too. Look at that. The cloud is hanging about in the morning, but that will clear for a paki fine day later on. In cool attempts, 15 degrees is a high in Daniburg. Into the lower North Island and it's perfect. 10 out of 10. 20 degrees is a high in Poemaranoi. A little bit of wind in Wellington but you're going to have clear blue skies by the afternoon. Enjoy your day. 15 degrees is your high in the capital. And to Tewipo N Nama, the South Island, it is a parky fine day here. You can hang out your washing here too. 18 degrees is a high for Nelson and Greymouth. Also a very safe day to strain your hair if that's what you're into. No humidity, dry weather and no rain. It is perfect forecast for that time of here. If that's you, you do you, boo, down the coast. Possible morning fog for almost everyone here. Turning into a fine day, 16 degrees is a high for Timaru, Oamaru, and Otautahi Christchurch. Alexandra gets as low as zero degrees today. To the deep south, a sunny day for almost everybody. If you're in Invercago or Rakiya-Stewart Island, you can expect the odd shower today. 19 degrees is a high for Ote Pote de Niedin. Nice and dearer. Thank you. We've been talking about impulse fires this morning because Maddie's fiancé, Ryan, put a horse. As you do. As you do. Go, Ryan. And so Kirby my dad nipped out for a few beers with a mate came back two hours later bought the pub I love that you say the pub he was drinking it brilliant I love that Brian impulse by a toilet seat not just any toilet seat wait for it a smart one. Heated, wash, blow dry, all with 18 buttons. It was a surprise for his wife. He snuck it in while they were doing renaos of the bathroom. At first she was horrified, but now she loves it. Does it have a bidet though? That is a game changer. Charlene, I just bought a two-person tent. I have a family of five. We never go camping. Not what you were. No good reason to actually buy it. But she bought it anyway. Go you, good thing. I'm going wild at these stories because I'm not an impulse buyer. You're a very smart shopper. It takes me a long time to even let go of my money. And I think about the thing that I want for like a good long period before I actually just go and do it. I love that. I wish I was you. Oh, it's probably a happy medium though, right? Yes, there's fair. It also comes from a lot of practice of being broke and making terrible decision. So then you calculate a lot better. Experience. Experience. Experience. Experience. Some of these people's impulse buys are big, like the pub, but some of them are really small. Like Cheryl Lee just bought a juicer, although she said the juicer was fine, but it cost about $10 to make half a cup of apple broth and a whole lot of mess. Cheaper to just buy the juice. I love Emma, just before we head to the break. Emma, and I said this one earlier, but during her last pregnancy, she bought half a boat, piano that needed to be picked up the same day, and some free yaka plants, which are too big to put in the car. And who's going to say no to a pregnant woman? Exactly. Keep them coming in as well. We love in hearing these breakfast at tvNZ.com.com. Coming up, a golden anniversary worth celebrating. We're looking back on 50 years of incredible kapahaka moments at the matatini I got in too deep rot into the core as long as jack doesn't go to prison is this justice at last everything I did was for you killing Curtis too Rotten to the core.

Festival, I remember that. Morena, thank you, kauta. Welcome back into breakfast. Sorry, we're in full-on conversation here. It is time to celebrate 50 golden years of kappahaka. The Matatini Performing Arts Festival has been a space for Māori to showcase our uniqueness, language and culture. And we've seen some incredible performances over the years. Take a look at 2019, winners, Gautumanako. I'm This kid Thank you, Kewan My do I'm Keriwa. And to mark this special anniversary They've created the TM 50 project 50 years Being compiled into a keepsake music album book and documented web series And here to share Just our special this moment is As the Matatini board member being compiled into a keepsake music album, book and documented web series. And here to share just our special this moment is, is the Matatini board member, Annette Wehi, and TM50 Project Manga, Project Lead, Perewihongi. Morena Cora. Thank you. So good to have you both here and to be talking about a celebration of us. And I know 50 years is amazing, and I want to get to that first. But can we talk first about how the stage is a place for us to be us? Yeah, you're right. For 50 years we've been telling our stories through haka, through mortiaia. So if we look at Nauti Manako, that whole mortiotea in their last winning bracket was all about the struggle for the reo. And a challenge, like we were just talking about before, for us that have babies and mokopuna growing up in the reo, you know, we had kohangereo, we had kura korea, but what a maumo, what a waste, if we, all of those that grew up in that system don't use the real. So that's just one way out of a bracket of seven items that you get to tell your stories. We talk about love, we talk about peace, we talk about our battles before, we talk about political co-papa, we've talked about suicide, we've talked about the influence of Waipiro and the bad effects that's had on us. But this is our time. If you want to know what's going on in the Aal Maori, come to Te Matatani. And over those four days, you'll get a snapshot of everything that is dear and important to us. I remember it going back to, you know, Te Rotorua, right? Those were the first days of Te Matatani. But I think back then it was called like the cultural festival. I think it was called back then. Yeah. But, Peri, this, oh man, when I say it's not really new for you, but as you were saying, you were kind of one of the, you know, the last generation coming through. My very first performance at you, losing my mataginiri, as they say, was actually only 10 years ago. So in the last fifth of the Matatini legacy. But I mean, look, I was grateful and I was lucky and fortunate enough to watch the likes of Annette and Tewaka Hui groups performing and inspiring myself growing up to hopefully one day take that stage. And I've been fortunate enough to stand on the Matatini a few times, but really, really excited to bring this co-papa here to Tamaki Makoto, knowing that this is, yeah, that's exactly it, knowing that there's so many faunao here and the access to this co-papa will be much larger. So really excited to see more faces come through to this co-papa. You were talking about the Waka Huya, obviously, Annette, that's you. You and your hubby. So in terms of, you know, leading, in terms of performing, etc. for this co-papa. You were talking about the Waka Huia, obviously Annette, that's you. You and your hubby. So in terms of, you know, leading, in terms of performing, etc. I mean, what is that like? What is that like not only to be able to lead that but to be on the stage? You can come in this one as well, Pere, but to be on that stage. It's a lifestyle, so all the kappa so our Fanae so it is telling our stories, but it's also about us having that 20 to 25, 30 minutes, if you stretch it out, time to tell your stories. But behind the scenes, what Kappa Haka has done for us is it's a place for for khanongatanga. So Mata Waka or Ropu like ours, Tewakohia, that are in Auckland, we're made up from all over the place, so we're tribal, pan-tribal, and so it's a place for for for for knowingata. For those of us that are back at home in the regions, again it's learning our fukapapa, learning our own stories, learning our own koreo and connecting that faka through that. So that's what kappa haka does behind the scenes on stage. You have that moment to represent our people at the highest level for us. Teno pu hae hae-hai, I'm at the way I'matakitaki I'm at your kautau. No, it's a puhai. Oh, no, no. Maha'i-nui. Well, yeah, it is. I mean, you talk about 25, 30 minutes, or 20, 25 minutes, but actually it's months, if not years of preparation. The reason that I say that I'm jealous is because I need it at Kura, and then when I left, and then I feel, you know, sad that I haven't actually continued when I watch you on the stage and just I love it. But anyway, Pety. I mean, let's be real here, Jame, Mae. The Matatini is most definitely the epitome of competitive kappahaka, but it's not the be-all and end-all for kappa. We have so many different kupapa, so many different haka-gahu, iwi festivals to really get in touch with that Taha Māori and get on stage and experience that. But if we are to look at the Matatine and what it's created, it's actually an important part of thea Māori and that it's influenced and inspired so many of us in all of our different chosen fields. And so I think the importance of this kauapapa actually is, yes, it is challenging us to evolve our craft and evolve our culture. But there's also the entertaining factor there as well that really reels in anyone, no matter who you are, to this kaupa. Yeah, you talked about Tiao Māori, but actually, The Matasani... Al-Tiro. Yeah. Yeah, you talked about Tiao Māori, but actually, Te Matasani... Al-Tanoi. It's for all of us. Part of our heritage. You know, we can't ignore it. We can't ignore the reo. And look at the journey of Te Rue. And Te Matatani's been a big part of that as well for, you know, going back to Tuakouia's entry in 1986. There were very few, like, less than this, many speakers that were fluent. And look at all of the kappa haka now. You know, so that's been really influential. Tematani's been really influential in the revitalisation of Te Reo Māori and the way that we connect with people. But it is part of Aotearo's heritage. Yeah. Beautiful. Right, we're run out of time. Love me. Fautiwa. Yeah. February next year, Tamatsati here at Eden Park. February 21st, Poiriri, at Takaparafau, on that sacred fenua up there, at Gnati-Fatua or Rake. And the four days are the best of the best. And just quickly, 50 years. Okay, we can't forget this, 50 years, so we're celebrating with 50 weaata. How's it? And I just really want to quickly make a note as well to Rob Bruha and the amazing work he's done to really directing this kau-papa in terms of the album in itself and really collating 50 songs in an album. And then outside of that, you've also got 50 mini docu-series to accompany each of those waiata so that we're hearing the song, yes, but we're also learning in-depth the history of each of those waiata so that we're hearing the song yes but we're also learning in depth the history of each of the waiata and then of course you've got a pukapuka there available as well to keep I guess these stories alive for the next 50 plus years of the Matata we're recognised our legends knowledge them all I'm sorry to our koroa thank you both so much for coming in this morning but Peter you're actually staying with us because we are going to be back with your news Thank you, thank you very much for coming in this morning. But, Peter, you're actually staying with us because we are going to be back with your news. But before the end of the show, Peti's performance with us here on breakfast.

Before we get to Enderina 8.30 news this morning, we've been lucky enough to meet Peter, the T-Rex, the epic new exhibition at Auckland Museum. Tessa Parker is hanging out with her old mate Peter to see what we can learn about the time he roamed this earth. Morena, Tess, how's your friend going? Morena, team, Peter's going great. And I'm also here with my friend Matt. And Matt, the crazy thing about seeing Peter assembled like this is that it blows your mind to think that an animal this big once roamed the earth. I mean, talk to me about that head. Absolutely. T-Rex is the largest predators ever lived on land. I mean, that skull had a six-ton bite force, which is three times more than a saltwater crocodile, which is pretty incredible. It really is a massive beast. It's 11, 12 meters long, three meters high at the hip, weighed around six tons. Wow. How, I mean, how far could they run? They could run a long way, and pretty fast. They were running about 20 kilometres now, walking about 20 kilometres now, when they're fully size, they're too big to run, because those leg bones would have broken. But really incredible, I mean, look at those leg bones. They're just amazing. And Peter, he does have a broken leg bone that tells us about how he died. What happened to Peter? Absolutely. When Peter died, his leg bones were smashed apart, they were ripped apart. There's T-Rex tooth marks on his fema, on his thigh bone, which suggests that he was actually killed and eaten by another T-Rex, which is pretty amazing. Would have been a big animal to take him down. That is wild. And you told me when you guys were getting set up that you had so many kids here really excited about Peter and watching it all go down yeah what did that mean for you to see all those kids look it's huge kids love dinosaurs and people might say well T-Rex is it relevant to New Zealand science is really important in the moment there's issues around extinction and climate change and Peter T-Rex is just a perfect way to bring kids in and talk about those important science stories. Very, very true. So when can we all come see Peter? Look, we're open from tomorrow. Peter's going to be on display for six months. He's free to the public. Come on down, bring your kids. The cafe is open. We'd love to see you. Awesome. Thank you so, so much, Matt. And just quickly, someone helped to bring Peter to New Zealand from Auckland Museum, my very own Uncle Max, so I just want to shout out my uncle and say that I love you. And thanks for bringing Peter over. Yes, go Uncle Max. You were just saying your boys will be there in a half. Oh, seriously, they will love it. I don't know whether they'll get their head around the fact that it's real. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Because it doesn't look real. It's crazy. Yeah. It doesn't look real. But it is, and it was. It was a thing that was on our earth. Very exciting. Well done, Tess. Thank you. It has just gone 830. So here is Indira with your news. Adamaria, gathering limits, masks and seating requirements have now been scrapped for hospitality venues. The relaxation of rules comes as Al Therro operates under the orange traffic light setting from today. Face coverings are still enforced in retail settings on public transport and flights, but now optional in schools. COVID-19 response minister Chris Hipkin says the rules are clear despite some confusion. Ultimately, schools can make decisions about whether they're going to continue to ask their young people to wear masks. I'd certainly encourage school students to wear masks where that's practical and, you know, that's our message across the board really, which is mask use has a significant role in turning down the spread of the virus. But paediatrician Dr Jen Russell says now is not the time to drop masks in schools. This winter might be particularly difficult for New Zealand. We have influenza potentially coming back across the border and winter is often a time when viruses thrive because we spend more time indoors. Winter usually stretches our thin healthcare system. And so for this year, it does seem to be really prudent to keep wearing masks in schools because they are just an important layer. Gisbon and the East Coast have been hit hard overnight by the remnants of tropical, ex-tropical cyclone filly. State Highway 35 between Gisbon and Porthaca is closed due to flooding and downed trees. Many homes are still without power and in Gisbon, sewage is now being pumped into the Turangui River as the wastewater system struggles to cope. The council says it's highly diluted and the mayor is advising residents to play it safe today. We are asking everyone if you don't have to travel, just stay home, stay dry, look after each other and like I've said before, we've done this before, we'll do it again. Slow down and be patient this Easter. That's the message from police and Waka Kota'i after nine people were killed on our roads this time last year. It was the highest Easter death toll in over a decade. The transport agency is expecting significant traffic over the long weekend and asks drivers to leave plenty of time for their journey. The International Criminal Court has labelled Ukraine a crime scene following the shocking images of bodies left on the streets of Boucher. Meanwhile, an advisor to the mayor of Maripo has denied Moscow's claims. Over a thousand Ukrainian Marines had surrendered to Russian forces. President Volodymy Zelensky is urging with his Western allies to supply more weapons and ammunition as both sides prepare for a new attack. And the death toll in the South African province of KwaZulu Natal has reached 250 after extreme flooding in the region. Intense rainfall since Monday has seen some areas experience a month's worth of rain in a single day. Mudslides have trapped people under buildings and the provincial government has warned fatalities could rise further with more flooding expected. Entire homes have been swept away in the region's main city Durban. South Africa's biggest logistics and freight operator Transnet has suspended operations due to extensive damage to roads. And now in sport, Liverpool are in control of their European Champions League quarterfinal tie against Portuguese side Benfica. Liverpool opened the scoring in the first 20 minutes through Ibrahim Konate. A Benfica answering back with one of their own but moments ago Roberto Femino put Liverpool a year. Peter beautifully measured Diaz just let it get away from him the goal people let it get away from him to though and here's the chance Romino and Liverpool established a three-gold advantage in the... Femino scoring again for Liverpool. They now lead 6-2 on aggregate in the morning's other game. Manchester City remained scoreless in their second-legged match against Athletico Madrid, but they hold a 1-0 lead on aggregate. And the Wellington Phoenix have cemented their spot in the A-League's top six with a close win over Perth glory, a midfielder Gail Sandoval scoring the only goal to secure the Knicks a 1-0 win. As McGarry cut inside for him, can't draw a defender though. It deflects Central, and a deflected shot is in. Sandival is the man. The man, the Phoenix returned to Wellington on Sunday, and they take on the Central Coast Mariners. It wasn't a complete performance, but it was enough to get us over the line tonight to get the win, and the three points is massive for us, moving forward towards the back end of the season. Like I said, the boys will be pretty excited heading to New Zealand and playing a couple of games over there. Shot Wellington Phoenix. And taking a look at your weather this morning, it is pretty damn fine. Almost everywhere across the country. It's starting in the north. Look at that. It's looking much better than yesterday. It's really beautiful out here. 21 degrees is a high in Kaitaya, 20 degrees, 20 degrees in Fittiyanga for a lovely day everywhere. And moving down the country is a similar story. You're going to get clear blue skies. Those southerlies should also die out later today. We're coming up to it. Right here a high of 17 degrees for taupo, 21 degrees is a high in Tauranga. Gosh, that's gorgeous. And over to the East Coast, you're going to get some morning cloud here and that will clear for a parky fine day. I am so happy for you guys because it's been pretty rough in the past 24 hours after cyclone filly. So stay safe. Don't forget State Highway 35 is closed today. Take care out there. 17 degrees is a high in Givy. Into the lower North Island. Amazing. What's a bit of wind in Wellington this morning, but the rest of you, it's gorgeous. Toma Ranoi, 20 degrees is your high. 18 degrees is a high in Levin. And Teteuipoanama, the South Island. Beautiful sun everywhere, clear blue skies. A blenum, you will hit as low as 3 degrees today, but you will peak at 18 degrees. In fact, almost everyone here is 18 degrees. 16 is high in Kokoda, 19 degrees in Westport. And down the coast, you'll get some possible morning fog here for almost everybody, but that will turn into a lovely fine day, as you can see, a 16 degrees is a high for Timuru, Oamaru and O'Totahe, Christchurch. And to the deep south, it's a sunny day for most of you in Vakagal and Rakiw at a Stuart Island. You can expect the odd shower and 19 degrees is a high for Ote Poti, den Eden and Apopo looking ahead to Good Friday, it's a good day for an Easter egg treasure hunt outside. Nice start to the long weekend for most of you across the Motu. Few showers in the west, in the westland, sorry, south and Fjordland. That will develop to rain later on in the evening. Then on Saturday, it's mostly fine in the North Island and a mixed bag for the South. Thanks, Indira. We've been getting some brilliant feedback from you about your impulse purchases that you've made. Dave, I went to Bunnings to buy a kitchen sink, came home with a puppy. How? That's the one thing I thought. Yeah, I don't know. Ainsley went out to buy candles for our wedding. Bought a car. Didn't even get the candles. Came home with an empty handle without the candles. Actually, there's a lot of you that have gone out to do different things, but I've come home with a car. I'm not really sure what that's about. Rebecca, same thing. Hubby and I went to Topo for a concert last year, came home to Auckland with a new car, go you good things, but I do like Mary. I mean, you know, sister, $300 for a pair of cowboy boots. Go you just to wear one night for a dress-up party. That is the thing about dress-ups because I love a good dress-up and I love going all out for a good dress-up, but sometimes you have to spend a lot of money to get it right for literally. You're right, one night. One night. I just, I don't do dress-ups. You don't? I like, I don't. Betty, though, this made me laugh. Sad.

I load the blankets. Yeah. And then just sits in the cupboard, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's actually cheap. Actually, yeah, yeah, that's one of my... I load the blankets. Yeah. And then just sits in the cupboard, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, not cool. Hey, thanks for your feedback, though. It's been keeping us entertained this one. We really appreciate it.

All new snack masters, Wednesday, 7.30 on 2. Welcome back to breakfast at 16 minutes to 9. Last Friday, Warriors player Marcello Montoya threw around a homophobic slur during a game. It resulted in the NRL judiciary, handing him a four-week ban for a derogatory comment. But this conversation is bigger than one comment made by one rugby player. It's about the conversations we are having with friends and family and the type of homophobic language that may, for some, slip through the cracks. Here to discuss this further with us is New Zealand's gay and inclusive rugby club, the Falcons, team captain Brad Christensen. Morina, Brad. Morninga, Madi. How are you doing? Good, thank you. Good. Hey, tell me about the Falcons. First of all, this is awesome what you guys do. Hey, it's a really cool, fun team that's inclusive. And we promote diversity, encouragement, and most of all fun for anyone to come and give rugby a go. Do you know what I love about it? Because I think about when I was growing up, and the rugby field really felt like a place that I didn't kind of belong. But it's not that way at all. And it's really changing, right? Yeah, absolutely, and we look across the rugby spectrum in Alteiroa and women's rugby and in trying to get children's rugby up and going, where there's a place for anyone to play. And rugby's a great game because it's a game for any position, any body size, whether you're fast, slow, tall, short. So gay, trans, it's for everybody. Yeah. And that's what we're trying to promote as the Falcons. Especially in a country like New Zealand where rugby is such a huge sport for us. Absolutely. So then how do you feel when you hear a story like this of Marcella Montoya throwing around a homophobic slur and a pretty bad one at that? This wasn't just a, this wasn't an offhanded remark. This felt like a really pointed comment that he was trying to make. Yeah, absolutely. And I think what we've seen and heard in the media around, oh, it was a heat in the moment slur. Yeah. Despite that, that doesn't excuse what he said. You know, there's young kids listening. There's, you know, families listening. And given the NRL's got a diversity values and policy that anyone can go and look at, you would think that their players would be upstanding to those values and their conduct. I think the thing for me is, you know, there's a lot of talk of heat of the moment. And I totally get that. I mean, I don't play rugby myself, but I can appreciate it what it must be like in the field and there's that competitive element and all of that kind of thing. But clearly he felt that that word that he used was going to be a pointed word that he was, he meant as a hurtful thing to say. And it's, and it's, and itobic and it's um if we if we think about you know our recent history around um racial slurs on the paddock or you know on the on the cricket pitch or whatever that's it that's a no no because it's it's it's bad right totally um so it goes the same for homophobic slurs. It's on par with a racial slur. It's a negative connotation. Our friends in the Rainbow community and the trans community, it is hurtful because we've had to grow up with some of those slurs. And we need to just try and, I guess it's our opportunity to educate and try and get a bit. Yeah, because, you know, I think about some people sitting at home going, I guess it's our opportunity to educate and try and get a bit. Because, you know, I think about some people sitting at home going, oh, don't be so sensitive. It's just a word. Don't let it hurt you. But actually, we've had a lifetime of this. We've had a lifetime of hearing those things said to us personally as a way to hurt us. Absolutely. And again, I talk about a racial slur. You know, people would say, there's just a word, don't let it hurt you. And I understand we should all understand that we're on a continuum of being offended. Totally. And for some people, it might not sound offensive to them, right? But for a lot of people it is. Absolutely. It's a bit like me, you know, maybe saying, hey, your mama joke to you, that's offensive. And most people would take offense to that. So if we kind of, that's the context I kind of want to put things in for people to actually kind of take a step back and think about, you know, how am I going to use words as I move forward? How do you, you know, you're on the rugby field all the time. You guys are playing regularly in tournaments and all of that kind of thing and socially. How do you find the environment these days? Do you think it is changing? I think it's changing in my four years and being involved with Falcons. I've seen a lot of change. There's less homophobia when we're playing teams. We're welcomed into our other clubs around Auckland and the president's grade that we play in and the monarchy is really there from other clubs. And I think that's about them learning and understanding that we're just people that want to play rugby and actually learn off them because we've got a lot of brand new rugby players coming in because they were too scared to play before so that monarchy has been really really well received but has that been a journey Like have you had instances in the past where you or members of your team, whether it's within the Falcons or outside of the Falcons, have been subjected to kind of on the public language? And I guess in the, you know, since the Falcons were formed and early iterations of, again, inclusive rugby team, there was a lot of homophobia. There's a lot of homophobic slurs, but in my time, it's, you know, it's decreased. Yeah, and I think about the journey that we've had as a society and got it, we're still on it, right? It's not, it's not like homophobia has just been wiped out. No. But I think about the journey that we've had in, you know, when I was at school growing up, people used to say that's gay as a way of, that's bad, and it had a negative connotation to it. And that's generally been phased out for most people, because people understood that it just was a thing that you shouldn't say. That's right, and it's the evolution of a language too, right? And just been more conscious and aware of actually what's, what's right and what's wrong. So it's really, of actually what's right and what's wrong. So it's really, it is really about, yeah, being educated. Totally. And aware of who you are with and who you're speaking to. Yeah, absolutely. You know, and again, I think there's an opportunity for, you know, for the NRL and for Montoya as well to kind of move past this. There's a learning opportunity, and role model that out. They are role models, right? Absolutely. And people look up to them. Absolutely. And so they mimic their behaviour often, especially younger people, right? Absolutely, yeah. And it's hurtful. We don't want our young Tarangatahi to be hearing that, if they're on a journey of identity and, you know. But I'm pleased to hear that it's getting slowly a bit better. And you were telling me that you're getting regularly, so many guys that want to join the Falcons and be part of this inclusive rugby team, right? Absolutely. And, you know, that warms my heart. It warms Auckland Rugby's heart because, and Indians that are, I guess, because it gets people out there. It's promoting rugby, not just a gay and inclusive club. Totally. It's awesome. Absolutely. Hey, well, thank you, Brad. I really appreciate you coming in and sharing your insight. And if people want to join, just look up the Falcons, right? Look up the Falcons. We're on social media and we're on Facebook and we've got a website. So, yeah, it'd be awesome if you touch base. God, you're a busy man, Brad. Just as busy as you. Thanks, Maddy. Brad and I host a podcast together. Out the gate, you can listen to it on all your streaming platforms, just that I get a little plug there. Nice little plug there. Like that? Hey, nice to see you, Brad. Thank you so much. Thanks, Madi. Right, stay with us. We'll be right back after the break.
