This war brought women into the forces, and in all branches they've done great work. But service life brought out one weakness, their feet. On her feet all day, a girl soon knows where the shoe pinches. Comfortable shoes and first-class treatment were the answer to put casualties. At centers such as these, the girls On her feet all day, a girl soon knows where the shoe pinches. Comfortable shoes and first-class treatment were the answer to put casualties. At centers such as these, the girls in the forces have their foot problems solved. These impressions reveal fallen archers or other weaknesses. When it comes to fitting, it's not a matter of trying on shoes, but of measuring the feet. This measure tells not only the size but the width as well. And when shoes have been specially made so that there are six weds available in each half size, there's no such thing as a misfit. But to make doubly sure there's an X-ray inspection. Here both fitter and wearer can see how well the shoe does fit. Small wonder that girls no longer parade sick on account of corns and bunions. Girls in the New Zealand forces have been the world's most fortunate, for nowhere else is there such a service. But good fitting shoes don't cure old complaints. To relieve aches caused by poor choices in the past, treatment is necessary. And what was designed for girls in the forces is now being extended to nurses. To hospitals outside the main centres come these mobile units. Inside these vans, the nurses find all the shoe-fitting facilities of the permanent centres. For these girls, foot comfort will alter their careers. No longer will nursing be notorious for its effect on the feet. Well-shod and put-happy girls will make more efficient nurses. So patients too will benefit from this scheme. In fact, the information and experience gained in equipping wax, wafts and wrens in wartime offers possibilities for better shoe service for everybody in the days of peace. In these Marlborough fields, linen flax is being grown to provide Great Britain with linen fiber. But there's another story in the seed of linen flax, which after being separated from the fiber contains approximately 30% of linseed oil. New Zealand has faced a threat and serious shortage of linseed oil, but a factory was established at Dunedin. And here the seed is first passed through a cleaning machine. After being cooked to break down the seed cells, alternate layers of filter cloths and the cooked seed are placed in the presses. This automatic filling hopper places 24 charges into the press, which like the other machinery in the plant has been adapted from machinery already in the country. The press exerts a squeeze of £4,000 per square inch. This extracts the oil and it flows into catchment trays to gravitate to settling tanks. The press is the The presses are unloaded and the filter cloths removed from the cakes, which represent the residue of more than two-thirds of the total weight of seed. These are cattle cakes, but nobody expects a cow to sit back on its haunches and politely nibbled a biscuit, so the cakes are racked and dried, and then broken up and crushed, to provide the valuable stock food known as Linseed meal and Linseed nuts. In the meantime, the Linseed oil has been pumped from the settling tanks to the filter presses, from whence it goes to the maturing tanks. After aging, it's pumped to the filling station, where as clear golden linseed oil, it starts on its journey to be used in the manufacture of paint, printing ink, soap, and in other industries, while some returns to the farmer as stock medicine. About three quarters of a million gallons of linseed oil are used annually in New Zealand. Time, not war, is responsible for the ruin of this building. 19 long centuries have passed since the Coliseum was built for the sport fans of ancient Rome. For New Zealanders now so busy doing Rome, the Coliseum is first on their list of must seas. Inside, they realize that even modern sport-loving New Zealand hasn't a stadium to compare with this. Its 150-foot walls are half as high again as our tallest city buildings, and no sports ground in New Zealand can seat 50,000. If they can't admire the sporting tastes of the ancient Romans in throwing people to the lions, they certainly can admire their building. Here the early Christians were marty but here in what is now the Vatican City they triumphed. The great basilica built over the tomb of St. Peter marks the site of the first church built by a Roman Emperor. New Zealanders thronging the square in front of St. Peter's find after four and a half years of travel that Rome is the most interesting city of all. Here they see architecture and planning on the grand scale. For as builders, the 17th century popes, surpassed the Caesars. Leave in Rome is short, so the boys are keen to see as much as they can in a day, for this is the sightseeing opportunity of a lifetime. St Peter is a prominent figure here. But it's the basilica of St. Peter's that's the centre of interest. All day, especially conducted groups of New Zealanders come to see this famous church. For Catholics, this visit has a deep spiritual significance, but all, whether Catholic, Protestant or agnostic, are greatly impressed with the church's immensity and its wealth of decoration. After visits to such architectural masterpieces as these, the New Zealand has realized that Rome certainly wasn't built in a day."}
