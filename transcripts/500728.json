Tenakotokato. I'm Bernardine Oliver Kirby. Welcome to Thursday. You're with AM early. Excited punters have spent the morning in clubs as our traffic light settings changed to orange overnight. Video posted by popular Auckland Student Club Bar 101 shows lines down the street as people waited for the return of dance floors at midnight. The change to orange means limits on door gatherings have been dropped or indoor gatherings have been dropped, along with the need to remain seated and distanced. Hospitality Association President Nick King told News Hub live at 8, things are moving in the right direction, but the bounceback will take time. Recovery is long. The confidence is there. We just need to continue doing what we do really well, getting people back, passion on the dance floor is a good start. He says the call to remove masks in bars and restaurants was well overdue. Severe weather has compounded existing problems on the East Coast, the call to remove masks in bars and restaurants was well overdue. Severe weather has compounded existing problems on the East Coast. A cyclone fairly continues to banter the Gisbon and Wairoa districts. Several homes spend the night without par, while many remain cut off by damaged roads. A flood warning is in place for the Hikawa River, with the two districts remaining under a red weather warning. Emergency Management Minister, Kiddie Allen, will be in wide o'er this morning to assess the damage. 259 people are dead in the wake of extensive flooding and mudslides near Durban in South Africa. Ongoing search and rescue efforts are uncovering the grim aftermath of this week's storm. Officials say some areas saw months' worth of rain in a single day. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the storm as one of the worst in the country's history. US police are continuing to hunt for the suspect responsible for the New York subway shooting. At least 20 people were injured five critically when a man wearing a gas mask opened fire on a carriage. 33 rounds were shot from a semi-automatic handgun, which was later recovered along with a hatchet, fireworks and a container of gasoline. Police say the owner of a delivery truck that has since been connected to the incident is now their investigation's main point of focus. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is being described as a death blow to some of the world's most vulnerable economies. The United Nations is warning of supply shortages and one of history's most severe refugee situations, and that's sent the markets into a spiral. Its latest figures show that one in five developing countries won't see their GDP return to 2019 levels even by the end of next year. Secretary General Antonio Guterres says the war in Europe has only accelerated the issue. We are now facing a perfect storm that threatens to devastate the economies of many developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and the lack of access to adequate resources to finance the recovery in the context of persistent and growing inequalities. Meanwhile, the United States says Russian troops are still moving into Ukraine's eastern territory, raising fears a large-scale assault could be imminent. Back here, the RSA is raising concerns about the Defence Forces deployment to Europe in support of Ukraine. The organisation is calling it a national shame that the government-funded veterans' assistance may not be available for the 50 service people. President B.J. Clark says despite no plans to enter Ukraine, post-traumatic stress is a real possibility when dealing with war. New Zealand has created more than 30,000 veterans under the age of 50 since 1990. In sport, the A&Z Netball Premiership is ready to rumble, with full crowds finally allowed back into games under the orange light settings. The season's been heavily disrupted by COVID with a host of games postponed. As a result, the Northern Mystics haven't played in almost two weeks, while the stars have only played two of their six matches. But Mystics assistant coach Robin Wright's relieved they'll finally be able to play at packed stadiums again. They're over the moon that we actually get rural crowds back and it's just fantastic for netball. The whole country's been starved of live netball size. It's fantastic for every team. The Wellington Phoenix have consolidated themselves inside the A-League's top six with a 1-0 win over bottom of the table, Perth glory. A rain-soaked pitch made it difficult for both sides, but Mexican star Gail Sandoval stepped up for the Phoenix, breaking the deadlock with his fifth goal of the season. The victory moves Wellington up to fifth on the ladder. He'll return to New Zealand tomorrow as they look to play their first match in more than 300 days on home soil. All right, let's take a look at the weather for Thursday as we head into the long weekend. The weather, bad for hats, great for making power. At Rudion, we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Cyclone fairly has passed by the East Cape and has forecast to move south-eastwards away from the North Island. Heavy rain and severe south-west g passed by the East Cape and has forecast to move south eastwards away from the North Island. Heavy rain and severe south west gales for the east coast means weather warnings are in place for the region. Keep an eye out throughout the day these updates could change. The Lower South can expect a fine one with a frosty start to the day for some parts of the region Otepote de Niedon on 19 degrees, Oamaru 16. On the west coast, a fine day with light winds, evening cloud. Milford Sound 17 today, hawkotika, hoping for hive 18. Canterbury and Malbara, it'll be a foggy start for some. On an otherwise fine day for the region, Christchurch, Otatahi, 16 degrees, while Blenheim reaches 18. To the lower north, it's also a fine day, with any winds dying out by the evening. Wellington, 15 degrees, Masterton, 16. To the central plateau, looking good. A fine day forecast for your Thursday, Huanganui on 18 degrees Taupor, aiming for 17. Over on the east coast, where those weather warnings are in place for Gisbon, Wairoa and the Hawks Bay. The rest of the region can expect a fine day. Gisbon, 17 degrees Rotorua, a little warmer on 19. And to the top of the country, a great day in store. Fine weather forecast, just what you want to kick off a long weekend. Tamaki, Makoto, Auckland and Fotianga, 20 degrees. After the break, as we move into orange light settings, the Green Party wants the country to stay in red. Co-leader Maramah Davidson joins us next thing. Coming up next hour, we speak to CEO of Retail New Zealand, who says the government keeping masks for retailers is absurd. That and more later on AM.

Nor my hawky my youth, AM early. It is 20 minutes to six. In international news, the hunt is on for a key suspect in New York, a city following a shooting in the subway system that left multiple injured. The US Marshal Service have joined the Newark Police Department in their search and to tell us more on the story. I'm joined by AMUS reporter Lachlan Cartwright. Good morning to you, Lachlan. No arrests yet, but authorities do have a person of interest. They do, and that person is Frank James, a 62-year-old man who police suspect was the individual who opened fire in that transition in Brooklyn, injuring 23 people. And he is on the run. They have identified a van that he drove from Philadelphia to New York to carry out this attack. But there was a huge Manhattan underway. Those images yesterday were just frightening. He dressed in a gas mask. He went down into that subway platform, open fire, shooting 33 times. And thankfully, most of those people have now been discharged from hospital. But still, there is a manhound underway, and police are hoping to make that arrest as soon as they can. So in the States, you're allowed to name the suspect, and we know who he is, but do we know anything about this man? Is he known to police? Has he got any history that we're aware of? So what we do know is scant details about this individual. He did upload a number of disturbing videos to YouTube, where he goes on rants about the mayor of New York, Eric Adams, and attacks his position on safety in the subways. He also has a history of mental health issues, but we don't actually know what the trigger point was for this attack at this point. Yeah, pretty horrendous scenes, as you said. COVID numbers in the States, Lachlan, they're back on the rise and that's seen a return of some of the restrictions? I don't know. We've spoken about this on this program a couple of times now. Every time we think we're coming out of it, it's almost like, you know, COVID brings us back out. Now, there is an uptick in figures in D.C. and here in New York, that has led to the CDC saying that the mask mandate on flights will be extended out until May the 3rd, two weeks from when it was meant to be disbanded. And there is some concern now that this new, there's another new variant, this new variant will impact further on the recovery of COVID and we could be in a position where there are going to be more restrictions. So that's the BA2. So that means what masks on planes, public transport? That's correct. Yeah, marks on planes, public transport. Some office buildings are themselves putting back on the mask mandate. I just came from one in downtown Manhattan. So look, this is a situation. I think that we think we're coming out the other side and then, sad to say, another variant pops back up. See, this is really interesting because New Zealand has just moved to orange. And for the most part, we are mask-free, apart from those public transport areas as well and some retail stores. We love a good Kardashian chat. Chloe is under fire this time for tittering with Photoshop. Yeah, can you believe this? She's photoshopped true into... Shock me....images from Disneyland and has been caught out for it. This is just, I think, one of the most bizarre Kardashian episodes, if we can put them in the top 10 or top 20. Where do you think this sits in the bizarre Kardashian index? You know, a Kardashian photoshopping? It's been done before, hasn't it? All right, AMU, a reporter, Lockeling, Cartwright, always good to chat. All right, the country has moved to orange setting, but the Green Party isn't sold on the government, dropping restrictions and mask wearing in schools. They say that passing the peak doesn't mean passing the risk. Joining me now for more is party co-leader Marama Davidson. Morena to you, Marama. Do you think that the government's being irresponsible in moving levels? Should we still be in red? Morena Bernardine, we know that it will impact on people who are immunocompromised, disabled people, Māori and Pacifica, under five children, and our elderly to be loosening up the restrictions while we still have Omicon quite rampant across our communities. So yeah, we are quite concerned. And we are hearing from a broad range of public health officials, for example, who are particularly concerned about losing masks in schools. And that's an area that we'd like to be quite clear. We would like to see high-quality masks continue to be used in schools all across the country. I guess there's another underlying issue there with the masks in schools is the fact that the ventilation systems perhaps aren't adequate enough. Is that something that needs to be targeted instead of actually the physical mask wearing? It's both. And so we've been quite clear in our response is that, and improving targeted instead of actually the physical mask wearing? It's both. And so we've been quite clear. And our response is that improving ventilation across schools is actually affordable. But we've got to afford the types of protections that we need to put in place. So ventilation in schools, masks, high-quality masks being free and available to all schools. And also getting our vaccination equity rates up. So, for example, for the third shops of the vaccination, Māori and Pacifica are lagging quite a bit behind the vaccination rates for our general population. So, Minister, when's a good... Similarly and dangerously in our 5 to 11-year-olds. So when is it a good time to ease? What indicators would make you more comfortable that it's a good time to move levels? Yeah. So the first one is actually listening to the range of independent public health and epidemiologists that are clearly saying it's too soon. The pandemic is not over. That would be my first indicator of the advice that I would take is Green Party. And secondly, we want to see those vaccination rates become, you know, more equitable. So those rates that I just talked about, for example, in the 5 to 11-year-olds, we'd like to see those increase. We've heard, for example, that might be another couple or few weeks, for example, to continue to roll out vaccinations directly in schools would help get that 5 to 11-year-old rate. We know parents' families are concerned. We think that a bit more work would actually allay some of those valid concerns. So the Green Party stance, should we still be in red? Well, red has changed definitions, right? Many times over the past weeks and months. And what we want to focus on are the exact restrictions. We know that the government has decided to move the goalposts, but the Greens are concentrated and focus on the exact protections that we can still keep in place and that we can improve, like high-quality masks and ventilation and equitable vaccine rates. Look, you do make a good point as far as we've just talked to our US correspondent where mask restrictions are being reinstated because the numbers are on the rise. We've seen that not just in the States, actually. It's also in Canada and other parts of the world where they released, they loosened mask restrictions particularly in schools where all of our young and unvaccinated children are and so that has seen the rise of another release another outbreak of COVID cases and we can actually avoid that and some of these things are quite simple we think it's unacceptable I've got to say that our schools sent out an email saying, you know, we want kids to continue wearing masks. So I guess it's at the discretion of the schools. Let's touch on the cost of living crisis. We know what the problem is. Everything is just too darn expensive. But what do you do? What do you propose? What's the answer for Kiwi's lower? And Middle New Zealand also, who for many really are on Struggle Street. Yeah, absolutely they are. We've got a number of green solutions that we've talked about. For food in particular, and healthy kai, we really need to stop the profiteering and interrupt the supermarket duopoly. We really need to sit down and look at the exact comprehensive regulations that would stop that at its cause, that would stop those increases at the point of the genesis of the issue, which is breaking up that duopoly. It's had far too big a hold for far too long. That's one big thing that we would do. We would clearly increase wages to livable incomes, especially for those on the lower incomes and boosting benefits for those on the very lowest, lowest incomes. And we know that lower and middle income people are impacted on by massively high rents. Rents have been chisputed up at twice the rate of wage growth. So there are some controls that we could put in place to limit those rent increases to link rents to what previous tenants have paid and stop the hiking in between tenancies and to put a temporary rent freeze in place until we can set those limits on annual rent increases. All right, Green Party, co-leader Marama Davidson. Kiyoda, thank you for your time this morning. After the break on AM, when you pop to the shops, you'll still have to take your mask with you. We talk to the CEO of Retail New Zealand about what they think and its potential impact on the industry. The Reserve Bank has hiked the official cash rate by 0.5%, but this is just a taste of things to come. More for you next hour. They're the cring and creme of Qie comedy. What I like to see from our teams are some deleted scenes from Police 107. Stop, we're a p. With gags about news to make you giggle at your goggle box.

Tonight, 7.30 on 3 and 3 now. Lifestyles change. Whether you're sizing up or sizing down, you want a builder who can meet your needs. What made you decide to build a new home as opposed to buying a really made home? Well, we just assumed we would need to buy an established house. It never really occurred to us that we'd be able to afford a brand new house. Yeah, I just remember wandering around this show, I'm thinking. Couldn't believe that we could get something as nice as that. You know, the kids moved on. You sort of might think that you'd have to compromise. It doesn't feel like we've compromised at all. We wanted a downsize, and we've lived here a year. We haven't changed our opinion at all. Yeah. All the things that I've ever wanted, we've compromised it all. We wanted a downsize, and we've lived here a year. We haven't changed our opinion at all. All the things that I've ever wanted, we've managed to get in this little home. This is exactly what we need. We really love it. Hey, did you just put that in the too hard basket? What? What too hard basket? I used to be just like you. My accountant did not like that. I do not like this.

Sorry, that worked last time. I can fix this. Thank you. Yeah, I'm going to need a ride, huh? Our approved dealers can help find the right vehicle and finance for you. Oh, can we stop with the dry-through? No, my, Hokie Ma, you're with AM early at a six minutes to six. Time now to check in with our reporters around the country. First time, it's Mitch Redmond in Christchurch. And welcome to Auckland's world of hurt. Mitch, I'm going to let you break the news to everybody in Christchurch. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. I know all the talk over the past 24 hours or so has been around the orange light, but I just want to switch the attention back to Red just for the moment. I'm not talking about COVID traffic lights, though, in fact, physical traffic lights. Two red camera lights have arrived in Christchurch, the first in the South Island. And from next Thursday, we'll start dishing out $150 fines to drivers failing to stop. Now, the Christchurch City Council and Canterbury Police have named the two locations. The first being the intersection of Moor House Ave and Madras Street and the other being Moorhouse Ave and Manchester Street. There's been more than 100 crashes at both of these intersections with some of those being fatal to, so that's the reason that NZTA has chosen these locations for the red camera lights. Like I said, they will be switched on next Thursday, so it may be a good chance for Canary Motorists to think twice about running that risky orange light. Look it as a safety measure, but I cannot believe Christchurch has not had a red light camera. It's basically how Auckland pays for its roads. Not that we have good roads. Anyho, thanks for that, Mitch. Let's go to Ashley McCall and Wellington. And the Capitol back on the recycling bandwagon. Yeah that's right Bernardine. So glass recycling collections will start back up again on Monday but the council is asking residents to drip feed their stockpiles. This is because like everything else Code has impacted our waste services for over a month now and our drivers aren't immune to the Omicron variant either. So they're on the road to recovery they are rearing to go and the council estimates that they're expecting that we're going to see high levels of glass they don't want to inundate the processing plant so to help manage the load they're asking people to take their glass recycling out in stages or alternatively to take it to the recycling centre at the southern landfill. They're also reminding residents to check the recycling calendar to see when recycling is due for pickup on their street and remember to clean the glass. I can imagine though after yesterday's announcement there's probably going to be a lot of glass around the capital. Absolutely, and you don't want to miss recycling. You get into a world to hurt with that. I'll tell you what we are going to miss. We're going to miss you Ashley. It is Ash's last day with us. She's leaving us. We want to thank you so much for all you've done for our program and the AM team wishes you all the very best with your next move, Ash. Thank you. We will miss you. All right, let's head now to Nats Levy in Auckland. Nat's a digital platform for the good old-fashioned lazy Susan. I love a good of food chat. Yeah, it's positive social media news, can you believe it? Facebook group Lazy Susan, which is a sharing platform aimed to hype up local knowledge and local eateries with some free publicity that's all positive, is becoming and started a new group Lazy Susan Travels. Now the original platform Lazy Susan was where you could go on and you could say for example I'm out for a cafe lunch in Gleninus where's the best place for coffee and then members of the group will put in their local knowledge hype up the staff and put in as much positive detail as possible because in conversation is encouraged. So Lazy Susan Travels has now launched so that people can go around the country and even internationally as borders open and hype up just some really good local eateries. So it's Lazy Susan kind of reinvented for now. I absolutely love that. Thank you to our AM reporters. That was AM early. It is two minutes to six."}
