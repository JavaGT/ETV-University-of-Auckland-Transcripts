Three. You're 21 years old, man. I thought you would go for like 10,000 ounces. I'm a real underachieving 21-year-old, that's for sure, Todd. On this goal rush. Just know now that we're going to do 3,000 ounces and not an ounce more. I really don't get it right now. Don't drive away just yet. Can you build a bigger one? I'd love to bump our goal up to 4,000 ounces. Let's do it, man. What you say? Why not? Right now, we're standing on a big ass sail. Can fill the wind pulling this thing. Oh! Bro close! This lake in Oregon till Gene gets here, keep the damn thing running. Not here to ruffle any feathers or anything. I'm going to let me run the dredge a bit more. All shutdowns are still going to get okay by me. Six months ago, the Huffman crew left McKinnon Creek, The Hoffman crew left McKinnon Creek and the Klondike for good. Just go for us. But now they're back. Coming up, James! To dismantle Monster Red and take it 2,000 miles south to Oregon. Clear one. Yeah, clear it, let her down. Their first Oregon operation has so far produced a disappointing 50 ounces. I don't know why the high bar isn't produced. And we tested it. Something's going on. I don't know what. So they've opened up a second mine, the Buckland, and they need a wash plant. Didn't think we're going to need Monster Red, but it looks like we're going to. So we'll get it, break it apart, get it down there, see what happens. I got to get this plant to Oregon. We've got to getuicein. We're running out of time. So we still got a couple big pieces that we got to get out of here. We got that screen deck that's going to be a huge piece. Chamis, when we go to pick this, I want to tighten these cables up. I want to double check and look at every pick point. Roger that. That sounds like a good idea, Fred. Todd has drafted Klondike mine boss Seamus Christi and his crane to take apart the 100,000 pound plant. This wind's getting worse and worse. Yeah, the wind is bad. I'm nervous. But let's get hooked up. Try it. We'll put some weight on it. Ready, you ready? Let's go. Right now, we're standing on a big ass sail. You know, it's 20-thumb feet long, six, seven feet high. You don't put a sail that big out and see how much wind it catches. Let's give it heck, Seamus. Does it even move, Fred? All we've done so far is take a little cushion out of the springs. Yeah, it's coming off over here. We're moving. It's coming up. I can feel the wind pulling this thing. Come on, baby. Come on. Easy. Freddie, how's a look? When he clears the stand, we're out to have him come down. Looking good, Todd. Looking good. Nearly there. Yeah. The screen deck is safely stowed. All that's left is to remove the shaker stand. For the past two years, there's been over $5 million where the gold washed right under where my feet are and end up in those sluces. This is why we came here. This is the most important part. We can't screw this up. This whole trip is about this part here. It's pretty much priceless and it's custom. Can't just go out and buy something like this in short order. What do you think this thing weighs, Fred? With all those shoots and the catwalks and stuff, we're on up probably 25, 30. Let much do you think this thing weighs, Fred? With all those shoots and the catwalks and stuff, bon up probably 25, 30. Let's do it. 6,000, 7,000, 8,000. We're at 10.5,000. 15, 16, 17, 17, 20, 23, 25. Has it even budged? It doesn't even move to an inch. Keep hitting it. I'm about 36,000. I don't know, Todd, I don't think it should be this heavy. The crane is pulling at least 6,000 pounds more than the weight of the shaker stand. Still, it won't budge. What do you want to do, Seamus? I think we're going to let it down. Those skids could still be frozen to the ground. Oh. I'm just headed back, get started for the year, helping Tony move this other dredge. Gene Cheeseman is back for his second season as Tony beats foreman. It'll be good to do a challenging project. Something new, something different. Not too many people get to do that. His mission, take apart Tony's 500-ton second dredge, transported 150 miles, and bring the ancient gold machine back to life. You've got to barge it down the Yukon River, so that's another challenge. There's going to be some learning curve with that. Looking forward to getting started on the project. That's why I'm here. Oh, look, we're showing up down there. Nice, clean, white truck. He hasn't been the long time, says? Well, he hasn't changed. Let's put it that way. No, it'll be the same short. You know that. How's it going, team? Good, Tony. Yeah. Hi, Dean. You had to bring the weather with you? Well, I had to bring something. Had to bring something. Well, next time bring something better. Yeah. Things will be going pretty good. That's number two. We've been there two, three, four times, cleaned the deck a bit here, a bit there. Should be fun, I guess. Yes, it'll be fun. You being here, it will hurry things along. No, I'm ready to get going. Oh, no, you'll be ready. So what are your boats sitting here talking? I want to move that dredge, is what I want to do. You see my shipyard over there. Yeah. In the off-season, Tony Beetz bought two old tugboats to haul the dredge down the Yukon River. I don't know what the fuck got myself into, but whatever. You know, it's always more than you think it's going to be, right? We just have to get a crane down there and put the cockpit on, I guess. We have to change the props yet, I think. You're going to have to take that all apart anyway, so I don't know. I guess... Play with that. Yeah. See what the guy can do. And then we got this one over there. I don't really know what I'm going to do with this one. But I bought it. So, yeah, basically, Gene, we got a whole pile of in the yard. Glad you're here because you know more about the shit than I likely ever will. Get them in the water. Instead of starting on the second dredge, Gene has to turn a pile of scrap into a fleet of working tugs. You know, you got wiring, fuel tanks, none of the cooling lines are hooked up. I need to go make a few phone calls here about some controls and stuff. Do it. You know where the phone is? It's kind of endless. You look at the huge big picture of things that looks overwhelming. You're a problem, so to speak. We're going to have to make it work. That's all I got to say. Okay. I'm going to go work. I thought you were going to work on tempos. Go to hell. Go ahead and fire up that. Go ahead and fire up that 800 and bring it over and tap it. The Huffman crew is taking its $360,000 wash plant south to their new operation in Oregon. It's stuck right now. It's not lifting it. But the shaker stand is stuck fast in the frozen Klondike dirt. Freddy Dodge has a plan. They're going to grab that 800 and try to get it out of there. Try to nudge loose one corner of the stand to give Seamus a better shot at lifting it. Push out, push out on the arm. There you go. Talk to me. Again, you roll it this way. Roger. See if we can get a better angle. Yeah. Bro close. Okay, let's see if we can lift the old girl. We're going to try to get the bucket underneath there, jiggle it a little bit while Seamus is pulling. Yeah, 29, 30,000 pounds. They're starting to move. Perfect. Yeah! Good job, Seamus! Wow. They're starting to move. Perfect. Yeah. Good job, Seamus. Yeah, looks like $30,000 is the number. I hate permafrost. Just a little reminder of why I went to Oregon. Now one problem. I've got to find the cold. Letus is $7.50 cheese, $17 bucks. Prices are outrageous right now.

Sunday. This really is a dream come true. It all comes down to this. Welcome to the grand finale. This is it. Sunday. This really is a dream come true. It all comes down to this. Welcome to the grand finale of Master Chef New Zealand. The jaw-dropping final challenge. The stakes have never been hired. Time to give it everything you've got. Three, two, one. Brought to you by New World. Master Chef New Zealand Grand Final. Sunday at 7 on 3 and 3 now. We're making awesome progress. A little bit smaller crew, but we're motoring right along. I just hope we can keep this up for the rest of the season. At Scribner Creek, Parker Schnabel is on the gold. His new washblank, Slucifer, has produced a healthy 126 ounces after just four days running. It was surprising to see that much gold. This cut keeps going, like this little indication shows right now, we'll hit our 3,000. But Parker's capping his target at 3,000 ounces, the same as last year. We're at a bit of a limit because Tony's royalties start to really kick in and hit pretty hard. Over 3,000 ounces, we have to pay 25% royalty. We need to make money this year. We might be able to do as much gold as we did with 12 or 14 people last year. Only six or seven this season because mine is good and cheap and efficient. You know, if I was doing it, I'd definitely have some more hands on deck here, but I know Parker doesn't want to have any expenses. Just wants to have the profit. Hey, do you have about an hour? There's something I want to go show you. Okay. Need a second here. With fewer operators, Parker's looking at ways of moving dirt more efficiently. So where are we going? Well, I met this guy that mine's down here on Dominion. He's custom built and designed these conveyors that he uses, actually. To move all of his dirt? Yeah, everything. Mud, overburne gravel, all of it. You know, he just runs a three-man operation. Wow. Yeah, so these are the kind of piles you get, which are just nice cones. You know, the nice thing is normally in a cut like this, you know, for us to haul that waste out of there, we would have to, this wall, we would have to have a waste site ramped up out of the cut. So all that dirt that you would have to move extra, you'd have to establish a waste site in here and you'd have to truck all that stuff out. Whereas Adrian, you just have the conveyor in the cut, you have one road out, and everything's self-contained, right? No way sites, no dozers, no none of that. Adrian doesn't even own a dozer. It's like little Egypt here. So those are what he uses. What the hell? There's one Frankenstein machine right there. Yeah, they're pretty sweet. You're moving everything 120 feet away from you? I'd have to see one running. This machine is the brainchild of Klondike innovator, Adrian Hollis. Hi, Parker. How you doing, Mike? Good. Good. Good to see ya. Yeah, same. This is Rick. Hi, Rick. Hey, know. Hi, Parker. How are you? Good. Good to see ya. Yeah, same. This is Rick. Hi. Here you know. Here's our former. Okay. Well, this is what we do. This is how we move dirt here. This thing puts up about 400, 500 yards an hour. Wow. This is a cheap way to move dirt. So this whole cut, nothing but this conveyor. Nothing but this conveyor. Wow. This cut is actually 4,000 feet long. The 130-foot mobile conveyor sits on top of an old excavator. A single operator loads overburden into the hopper. The conveyor then shifts it 120 feet up and out of the cut. As soon as he finishes in one area, the operator simply moves the whole machine and starts the process again. You don't have any other crew other than one guy feed this thing. No, just one guy. He just runs around and he feeds this. He just comes down here. We just send him off with some pork and beans and he gets at it and the conveyor uses a fraction of the fuel burnt by a fleet of rock trucks so what's this thing cost to run we generally look at that like between a thousand twelve hundred dollars a day and you're moving four thousand yards a day sometimes more generally calculate all that costs on about 30 cents a yard. That's a third of what we're at. You can be on marginal ground, and it doesn't have to have that much gold in it, and you're looking pretty sweet at the end of the season. Pretty impressive. Would you be willing to help build this one? If you could supply the guys and the materials, and I'll look after it and we'll see if we can make one work. So what? I guess I need an excavator to put this thing on, huh? You certainly will. Depends how big you want to make it. Do you want to make a big one or a little one? Could you build a bigger one? Well, if you've got an old 700 sitting around, I would say you wouldn't have a problem with 150 feet. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks for your time. No problem. I appreciate it. Thanks for us. Great meeting. Yep. All Parker needs to start building his own Thanks, Andrew. Thanks for your time. No problem. I appreciate it. Thanks for us. Great meeting you. Yep. All Parker needs to start building his own super conveyor is an excavator. Yeah, I think it could really change our operation. You know, it could change a lot of things at our site. I think it could make us a lot more efficient. He's the mastermind behind this. So if he's willing to help, and I want to get one built.

We are at dredging. That's not too bad. In just the first three weeks of the season, Kevin has produced 536 ounces of gold, worth well over $600,000. I'll drop my bucket light down to about level. And off we go. That's nice bedroom. There's been tons of bucket line slippage today. It's worn right the. No, I am not moving at all. Even though the dredge is producing good gold, a slipping bucket line has been slowing it down. It's been an ongoing issue for since we started. Oh, up, up, up. Okay, you stop. You guys stopped. Well, I've shut it off because it was about a minute of the bucket line not moving at all. It was like it was stuck. So it kept turning up on top, but the buckets weren't moving. That was grinding the absolute... out of the sprockets. I can't dig that section. It was pretty clear. So no point. Be n'n't out of the poor dredge. Trying to get the ground when I count when I can't dig it. The bucket line works like a bicycle chain, which is driven by a drive cog. Wear plates on the wheel act as teeth that engage the bucket line. Over time, the wear plates have worn down, which means the bucket line is losing its grip and slipping whenever it has to dig the harder bedrock. We know there's some gold in this bedrock, so we're missing out. Every time the dredge hits bedrock, Kevin repositions it to mine shallower, softer ground. Shut down for five minutes, swing to where you need to go, and go from there. Here comes Tony. How's the go, man? That could be better. Watch out. The sprockets on the bucket line. The wear plates, those things... They're supposed to be square to catch the bottom. It could be better, watch out. The sprockets on the bucket line. Yeah? The wear plates, those things... They're supposed to be square to catch the bottom of the... Yeah. Go worn down. Instead of being this thick, they're this thick. That's causing the bucket line to slip. Oh, yeah. Because of that, we can't dig with it. So what are you going to do about it? I want to blow these ones off. Get the new ones we had made. bolt them and weld them and done. Yeah? So there's not really my problem. Why don't you wait until Gene gets here? Because then he can direct a couple welders and then they can put it in. Yeah, we don't need Gene for that. I can direct welders too. Yeah, but I'd be better off Gene here because then we have more people here and then he can take care of it. That's basically his job. Basically my job here, too. Just breaking the people over. He put one in last year, so he knows how it works. So why in your way for him to shop? So he can give you hands, so you see how it's done. It's three bolts. There's no rocket signs there. But we both know that I can get it on the go, right? Oh, yeah, but I can do that too. Just make it work until Gene gets here. Until then, keep the damn thing running, okay? All right. How can you do? Well, it would be really nice to get that fixed so we can actually dig again. Because he can't dig the gold-rich bedrock. Kevin has to settle for lower-grade material. Tony wants to wait for Gene to show up before we can fix those. He is the big boss, so he gets to make the big calls. I know it's supposed to be running the judge. Doesn't mean I get to. Okay. He's driving. Just drop them. Hit! Hit! Monster Red is finally loaded up. Good job, Jack. See back. Good job, Fred. Thanks for all this. And the Hoffman crew can start the 2,000-mile journey home and try to salvage their season. Away we go. Back to Oregon, right into the buckling. I'll be down. Parker, how you doing, man? Not so bad, how are you? All right, man. How's your summer going? Ah. Well, I don't know. I hadn't started off real great if you want to know the truth. Just here getting the plant, that's it. Trying to liquidate what I have. I got a hell of a yard sale going on. You need anything? What do you want for that excavator? Well, make me an offer. Let me have Mitch take a look at it, and we'll just put a value on it and go back and forth from there. But we do need a bigger hole like that for a project we're working on. It's all yours, buddy. I heard you're going for 5,000 ounces. Yeah, yeah. That's a lot of gold. Yeah, what are you going for? Three. Just doesn't make sense with our royalty rates, you know. You're 21 years old, man. I thought you would go for like 10,000 ounces. I'm a real underachieving 21-year-old, that's for sure, Todd. Yeah, there you go. What do you think you've achieved everything? Did you get a little gold in your pocket? Achieving 21-year-old, that's for sure, Todd. Yeah, there you go. What do you think you've achieved everything? Did you get a little goal in your pocket? Did I say that? Sounded like it. No. You tell me, man. I'm only 47 years old. What would I know? I just got finished bearing my grandpa. You don't need to tell a. I don't know. You know? I don't need the tongue like that? I don't know. You know? I don't need that. Come on. Come on. See ya. See ya. See you later.

Gene Cheesman has been sent to oversee a repair on the Dredge's bucket line. So I'm guessing you're here for the... Yeah, I got to look at the tumbler here and see what's... What's up? What's up with that? Just figure out a plan. We noticed it began to slip about a month ago. I've been trying to get on Tony's case to let us replace them, but he really wanted to wait for Gene for some reason. Gene isn't needed here. He's got better shit to do. He should be on dredge number two today. For weeks, Kevin and Jason have been wanting to make the fix themselves. You guys are all big boys. I don't think you need me out here. We kind of knew what was going to have to be done there, so. Not here to ruffle any feathers or anything, so. I don't think we need a babysitter. We kind of knew what was going to have to be done there, so. Not here to ruffle any feathers or anything, so. I don't think we need a babysitter, so. No, I'm not trying to do that, so I don't want you to feel that way. No, we'll be good. Yeah. Okay. All right. We could have fixed this problem on our own with the bucket line. We have the welders here. We have the wear plates. Everything was available to go, and we were just waiting for the go-head from Tony, and he insisted on waiting for Gene. Is Gene there yet? Yep, we're just looking at the Sprockets. We could get started on the Sprocket today, right? Them guys, they get started right now. Now he's in a rush. Okay. Okay, what is everybody doing, Kevin? He can start it right now. Now he's in a rush. Okay. Okay. What is everybody doing, Kevin? Phil's working on the bucket. Jason and Bob just finishing, cleaning out the hydraulic riffles for under the trommel. Jason finished up, increasing the bucket line. Are you going to bring the cleanup home? I can do that yet. Sure, everybody has a job, and now we'll see you here for supper. Gotcha. There's no different than your bicycle chain. If your teeth are screwed up on your bicycle chain, your chain skips. That's all this is, is a chain. And it's skipping because this rockets wore out. You know, you've got to change those out. These guys look like they got it figured out and doing a good job. You know, I want to go move dredge too. These guys look like they got it figured out and doing a good job. You know, I want to go move dredge, too. That's what I want to do and what I'm interested in. While Gene supervises the repair, Dredgemaster Kevin pulls the mat to take home to Tony as ordered. Tony's always going to micromanage. It doesn't matter if the clean-ups are good, bad, or great. That's how he operates. So I just learn to work with it, like a natural disaster. You don't just yell at the hurricane, you wait for the pass, and you pick up the pieces. I think for the second dread, Gene is just the kind of person we need. I think Gene's got the right mindset that he will take it apart in a way and put it together in the way that Tony agrees with, but it's also going to be done right. Like, Gene will not be lifting out one eye beam at a time. He's going to get a whole set going, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop. He's going to have everybody running around and moving. They're going to have a job. They're going to know it. They to have everybody running around and moving. They're going to have a job. They're going to know it. They're going to get it done. They're not going to have a choice. And then when they put it together, Gene's going to know exactly, that goes there, that goes there, this first, that second. We're changing that. Don't touch it. Well, we've got one new plate in. Five more to go. New wear plates means we should be able to dig way better than what we were. The slipping bucket line has limited the Dredge's ability to get to the good pay. As a result, we probably left some gold behind. A lot of that gold is sitting in the bedrock, and we weren't able to dig deep into that bedrock where it's really hard to dig. Take this off to Paradise so you can jig it, clean it, and we can see what we got. As someone who is blind, how do you define beauty? Can smell the Gregs. Brand new comedians giving lectures.

Tonight, 7.30 on 3 and 3 now. How are you going to do today, Kevin Beetz? I did a pan. I usually just do it in a five-gallon pail. Kevin has been summoned home by his father, while Gene Cheesman oversees a repair on the dredge. So how did that look? Not too bad. Yeah? There's a lot of materials, so there should be, hopefully, a lot of gold in that. Well, hopefully. Yeah, yeah. So if this turns out good, I'm gonna let me run the dredge a bit more. What do you mean about more? Run it 24 hours a day. That's not what I'm needing. I'm talking about like when you manage it. How you mean managing it? Well, like with the spark that's on the bull gear. Yeah. As Jean's plan is the exact same plan I told you a month ago. Yes. Are you going to give me more responsibility and let me make the call to go? How much more do you need? That when I say I want to fix this now, we can fix this. You can to fix this now we can fix it. You can run the dress all you want but all shutdowns are still going to get okay by me. Your regular maintenance all that sure. That's what we've been doing. But these sprockets, or when we do the rollers, or when we do the buckets, that's still all gross to me. Yeah, that's fine. But I don't need to want to wait for someone to come in with the exact same plan that I already have. I told you the exact same thing that Gene told you. It's as many hours out of it as possible, and then you gotta make the call. That's all that's done. But when I say, it's at time, will you listen? We'll just have to check that out now, don't we? Huh? You pee. Good, that matter. Yeah. Then it's your. He should know we can trust me to keep running, that I don't need someone to hold my hand every time I decide to go left or right. That's what he should trust me with. I don't give a what he thinks. Don't give a what anybody thinks. If I don't like it, it ain't happening. Anything shuts down? I make the call. Because he, otherwise, they'd be down all the fucking on. Whatever is the trick is, squeezes as much out of it as you can. How else are you going to make money? Turn the tap on, turn the type off. No, keep the. I'll tell you when they show it off. Until then, I'll make the call. I'm getting pissed off. I'm getting pissed off with this. Todd Hoffman really irritated me the other day by saying that we're like some sort of slackers only going for 3,000 ounces. Parker is on his way to see Tony in a last-ditch attempt to improve his royalty deal. Truth in the matter is, after 3,000 ounces, we just, we can't afford to pay a 25% royalty. At the end of the day, this is the business. We're stuck at 3,000 ounces as long as we're leasing from Tony and as long as he keeps taking the same position he is. For the last two seasons, Parker has repeatedly tried and failed to renegotiate the deal with his claim owner. Well, let's give this a shot. Knock, knock. Hey, Parker. Hi. I haven't seen you yet. I know. Sony's here about your granddad. Oh, thanks. You know, Parker. Hey, Tony. How are you guys doing? Look good. Oh, we're good. It's good this can be anyway. You bringing us goodies. I am. 100 ounces for you. How the hell you get that that quick already? Well, we just did 126 out of our first cleanup, first four days. So that's good. That's pretty good. And I figured I'd get you out of my hair and just give you the minimum royalty up front here. Well, that's cool. Four days, that kind of money. Yeah, not bad. That's the wrong with that. Off the back of that, you know, that's our minimum royalty payment. Yeah. We're really stuck on a maximum of 3,000 ounces with these royalty rates the way they are. But a deal is a deal. I mean, all I'm asking for is to cap the royalties at 20%. We could go for 4 or 5,000 ounces, which would put, you know, 20%, they'd put 2 to 400 more ounces in your pocket. That way we can just keep on chugging, and it makes it worthwhile for me to do, and you guys keep getting more gold out of the ground. I like something. Just not happening. At the end of the day, something needs to change, because I'm really not up here to just every year do 3,000 ounces or less. I really don't kill right now. I, and deal is made. We'll stick to this one. Good enough. Well, if that's the way it's going to be, just know now that we're going to do 3,000 ounces and not an ounce more. That's okay by me, Parker. Are we really going to stick to that? I think we should talk about it. I think so. Well, you gotta do something, because he wants to work. How many people this day and AIDS want to work? I'm not going to say royalties on that one planet. That's just not going to happen. I don't want you to do that. I mean, there should be options, right? Let them bring the gold. Okay. Okay. Hey, Parker. Hang in there. Don't drive away just yet. What's up? We're talking to Minnie. And what we're going to do is we're not going to change the royalties. But what we can do is what we're talking about is you've got two wash plants out there, right? Yeah, we have our one from last year still bigger it. And you got a whole bunch of ground this spring, right? So why don't we do it this way? If you start the second plant in the Indian River, then we'll start that one at 15%. Start even. But I think that way that gives you the opportunity to bang out a lot of gold and not go over 20% in each plan. Tony's offer allows Parker to mine another 3,000 ounces at the lower rate, as long as it's on a second claim. I think that's pretty well the best that we can do. Yeah, I mean, I wasn't planned on having two operations going this summer. But I appreciate the compromise. Yeah. Throw the ball in your card. See if you can work out. Right? Maybe you're not such a bad guy, Tony. You can't get out. Thanks, Tom. Target. See you later. That's a bit unexpected. I really wasn't thinking that was going to happen. This is pretty late to start a project like that. Like running a second operation and the second plant is, uh, it takes a lot of infrastructure, right? Do you have generators and pumps and feeders and loaders and a lot of stuff that goes into it? If he wants to work harder, if he wants to do more gold, what hell would I want to stop him? That would make no sense. So on the end of the day, he gets more gold. We get more gold. I mean, many I'll be happy. I'll just do what I'll do. Spend it. Let's go! Oh my God, which one's mine?

Parker has made a deal on Todd 700 excavator. He can now have Adrian build him a brand new super conveyor. Looks good. It's a little beat up. It came from the Hoffman's. Well, it looks as though with nothing that can't be repaired. No, I'm really looking forward to it. Five weeks should just about do it, and you're in business. Jeez. It's a lot of work. How's it looking, guys? You come have a look, you tell me. The Beats family assembles for the third gold way of the season. Faulty wear plates on the dredge have meant Kevin has struggled to dig high-quality pay. Now, they will find out how much it's cost them. There she is. 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 110. 30, 40, 60, 70. Are you going to quit pretty soon? No. Growing ones growing ties. 220.86 ounces. That's not bad for the week we had, right? Despite the slipping bucket line, Kevin has brought in $260,000 in a single week. It's hot, no touchy. Yeah, I think we could have done better though if you had let me fix those wearplaces with a back when. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we've got to got a lot if you had let me fix those wear plates with back when Wow, wow, no no no no no wah, we've got a lot more He's got a point oh really oh yeah I appreciate you want me to you know be involved in doing it but I think Kevin's more incapable of doing it So you're telling me you all growing up down there then? Well I'm trying to be Oh, okay So about this is give this so far for the season, where we're at? 7.56, 8. That's more than we had all last year. I'm happy with that. That's pretty darn nice. That dress is doing all we asked for and then so. Oh, yes. Right now, we must be on a lucky streak, I guess. If that continues, that'd be awesome. Kevin does have a point, though. Tony has to let go a little bit. The less people trying to make decisions, the better. It's like anything. Work by committee doesn't happen. So here I am. I'm going to make this year. Let's try that up, put her on the table, huh? 30 miles south, Parker Schnabel is also in his gold room, ready for his second boundary cut weigh-in. All right, let's see what this is. Their first weigh-in of the season was 126 ounces. There's 20, 60, 120, 140, 140 on the button. Whoa! Yeah, 145 ounces, button. Whoa! Nice. Yeah. 145 ounces, that's a good cleanup. That's worth nearly $175,000 and takes his total so far to 271 ounces, well on target for his season gold. You know, I keep bugging Tony about our royalty rates. And this week, he did make a bit of a compromise in that he said, the only way we're going to get away around the royalty rates is we can run a second wash plant, and it will reset at the original royalty rates. Really? It's got to be a different plant, different plan on a different cut, and be independent of the other operation. So each plant pays its own royalties? Yeah. Wow. It starts back at 15%, right? And then works up from there. We've got that ground on Indian River from Tony that we got last year, and we have yet to touch them at all. And it's all still trees and swamp. Huh. I'd love to bump our goal up to 4,000 ounces and try to do 1,000 ounces down there. I mean, if you want this, Rick, I'm putting it on you. You've got to want to do it, and you've got to take it on, and it's not going to be easy. So, it's on you. Let's do it, man. What do you say? Why not? Let's give it a try. Yeah, hell yeah. What are you thinking for a wash plant? Um, probably big red. I know when we parked it, it was pretty tore up. Sounds like you got yourself a project, Mitch. Yeah? That's it, man. We're going big. Let's get after it. You get a steady plow of gold going to that room, huh? Going big. Yeah. You know, we're going to go for 4,000 ounces. This is our year to go big. Trying to get another 1,000 with Big Red. Probably not the easiest way to get there, but if that's what we got to do, that's what we're going to do. Parker saying, it's all on me, well, that's kind of what I've been thinking about, you know, what it would be like. And so I'm pretty excited about that. And I get more excited by a second now because I didn't really see it happening anytime soon. But now it's pretty much being laid before me, and I've got a huge opportunity now. Yeah, I guess we're starting a second operation. Not really what I had in mind but, hey, gold price is good, fuel price is cheap so now's time to be pushing for everything we can."}
