Tapari atchiketena, adding to that, meet the Kiwi scientists studying the devastating volcanic eruption in Tonga by snorkeling over it. Stick around to find out more after the 7.30 news. It has just gone 6 o'clock, so here is Chris with your news. Thanks, Jenny Mae. Prime Minister Justinda Ardern set to head to Tokyo this evening in the next part of her first overseas trade trip since early 2020. One of her final engagements in Singapore, the unveiling of a symbolic carving, marking the friendship between the two companies. It takes the form of a kuwaha which represents a symbolic doorway. Jacinda Ardern labelling it a metaphor for reconnecting with Singapore. So it feels to me incredibly symbolic that within the space of eight weeks, New Zealand and Singapore, both reopen their doors to one another at the time that we unveil this coupa. Part of the Prime Minister's discussions with leaders on the trip is stability in the Indo-Pacific. Now, China's government says it's signed a security agreement with Solomon Islands. The deal that could see Beijing establish a military presence in the Pacific sparked concern from both the Australian and New Zealand governments, as well as the US. The announcement comes just days after Australia's Prime Minister visited Honiara in an effort to get Solomon Islands to back away from the US. The announcement comes just days after Australia's Prime Minister visited Honiara in an effort to get Solomon Islands to back away from the agreement. China claims it'll help keep peace in the region. The two sides will cooperate in areas such as maintenance of social order, protection of people's lives and property, humanitarian assistance and natural disaster response, and an effort to help Solomon Islands strengthen capacity building and safeguarding its own security. US officials are set to visit Honiara next month. Speaking before the deal was signed, State Department's spokesperson Ned Price says it could set a concerning precedent for the Pacific. We've communicated with our allies and partners in the region, including, of course, with Australia and New Zealand, which have expressed concerns about how this agreement may threaten the current regional security paradigm. Part of the task of the upcoming visit will be to share perspectives, to share interests, to share concerns. The Australian government says it's deeply disappointed the deal's been signed, saying there's no need for Beijing to play a security role in Solomon Islands. Moscow claims it struck more than a thousand Ukrainian targets overnight during its renewed full-scale military offensive in the east. Ukrainian positions along the entire front line in the eastern region of Donbass have been attacked along a 480-kilometer stretch. The BBC's Dan Johnson has the latest. Russian fire powers on display in these pictures released by the Defence Ministry and in the skies over Ukraine. It says missiles and artillery hit over 1,200 targets last night ahead of a new surge to push its forces forward across the east of the country. And this operation will continue. It is beginning, I mean another stage of this operation is beginning. Pro-Russian leaders in Donetsk say special forces are storming Mariupols as of Stahl steelworks, where the last Ukrainian soldiers were holding out. The renewed advance along the eastern edge has been anticipated for weeks, and the Ukrainians say they're ready. We can assess now that the Russian troops have begun the battle for Dombas, for which they have been preparing for a long time. A very large part of the Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive. No matter how many of the Russian troops are driven there, we will be fighting. We will defend ourselves. More soldiers are getting ready to join the battle. We were invited to film these volunteers training in the west of Ukraine, preparing to head east to hold back the Russians. They'll get hell. They'll get hell. They came in to our land to try to invade our land, try to horrify our people, and now we're just raining hell fire on them. This video claims to show Ukrainian artillery strikes taking out Russian weaponry, but there are still likely to be fierce battles ahead. People have been warned to get away from front lines, but as the fighting moves, it gets harder to work out where is safe. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has again apologised for breaching lockdown rules in his first address to Parliament since being fined by police. The Prime Minister, his wife and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, all paid fines for attending Johnson's surprise birthday celebration in June 2020 during a strict COVID-19 lockdown. But Johnson has insists he didn't knowingly break the rules. It did not occur to me then or subsequently that a gathering in the cabinet room just before a vital meeting on COVID strategy could amount to a breach of the rules. I repeat, that was my mistake and I apologise for it unreservedly. MPs will vote on Thursday on whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for misleading Parliament.

Right, taking a look at your weather this morning. That humidity you might have felt overnight is set to stick around in the north. All of you are in for showers this morning. That'll ease later today. 24 degrees the high for Kitey and Auckland. The cloudy started the day as we move a little bit further south. Drizzle in the Bay of Plenty and the odd shower in Kitty Kidor, Hamilton. 24 degrees your high. To the east, just some morning cloud in Hawke's Bay, but you're in for a mostly fine day. A shower or two possible in Gisbon. 23 degrees the high for most of you. And mostly grey through here, some light winds for all of you and showers possible in Tohmernui and New Plymouth, some warm temperatures to 27 degrees the high in Funganui. Across to Teuiponamu, the South Island, a rainy day in Nelson and down the west coast. Thunderstorms possible in Westport. In the east, you're in for some sun, 25 degrees the high there in Kikkoda. Some fog to start your day in Christchurch. That should lift, and it'll be sunny through Uamuru, Alexandra. Though you're in for some rain later in the day, getting to a high of 20 degrees. And it cloudy started the day in the deep south. Take a raincoat with you if you're heading out later. Some rain for all of you this evening and afternoon. 20 degrees, the expected high for Queenstown, Daneden and Gore. That's your news and your weather. It's all happening. Wet, wet day in Milford Sound. Thanks, Chamon. A gala dinner and a garden visit. The Prime Minister has been busy overnight in Singapore as she continues her trade visit. Here is political editor Jessica Munch Mackai with a wrap-up of events. Kiyo-ra from Singapore. Overnight, the Prime Minister went to a gala dinner that was held to honour her visit here to Singapore. It is, of course, her first stop and her first international visit post-COVID, and also Singapore's first time post-COVID receiving a world leader as well. Now COVID has played a big part in this trip. Of course, three members of the New Zealand delegation tested positive. And because of the strict rules in Japan, they are not able to travel on to Tokyo with the rest of the delegation. Even though they've all had COVID, they do need to stay here because of those rules. Now, the Prime Minister says that's just the cost of doing business in 2022. It's not without risk, but it is time now for New Zealand to be reaching out again, inviting people within this new normal to come and visit New Zealand because we are open for business. So one of the announcements on this trip has been an extension to the working holiday visa program between Singapore and New Zealand. New Zealand has extended the number of Singaporeans who can come over and work and travel from 200 to 300 and they'll be able to start applying in May. So that was one of the announcements that the Prime Minister has made here in Singapore. Also on the agenda, of course, is the situation in May. So that was one of the announcements that the Prime Minister has made here in Singapore. Also on the agenda, of course, is the situation in Ukraine. She has been talking to her Singaporean counterpart about that. And also, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Deal. Now, that's been a big topic of conversation. Of course, the US left that deal in 2017. And the other members, including New Zealand and Singapore, are very keen for them to come back. Take a listen to their answers when I put that to them in a press conference. What is your country prepared to compromise on to get the US to rejoin the CPP, and how important is its participation? We would dearly love to see them come back, but they have told us quite clearly, it's nothing to do with us, it's just off the table because their politics does not make it possible. It's our job to make sure that we're continuing to engage and offering up those opportunities where the United States can demonstrate an engagement in the economic architecture, and the economic well-being of this region. So overnight, the Prime Minister went to visit a garden here in Singapore, and it really was a chance to showcase Singapore and some of the beauty that it has to offer, but also send a message that Singapore, too, like New Zealand, is open for business again. The day-to-day will be spent here in Singapore with a big focus on business, and then later on tonight we will be heading to Japan. So we'll keep you updated on all the developments.

As we've heard in Chris's news, the long-awaited Russian offensive in the east has begun with Moscow claiming it struck more than a thousand targets overnight. For the latest, let's bring in BBC correspondent Anna Foster, who's live for us in Kiev this morning. Good morning, Anna. Good evening to you in Ukraine. Now, we've been reporting in our news about the Russian artillery and rocket attacks in eastern Ukraine. Can you give us an update on the situation on the eastern front line? That's right. So this has been building really for weeks now. You'll remember that Russia pulled its forces, pulled its soldiers and its tanks and its armored vehicles away from the capital, Kiv when it failed to take it in the early days of this conflict. And in order to try and salvage something, really, they moved everything east because the Donbass region, places like the Hansk and Donetsk, those Russian-speaking areas, are really key to them. Those are the parts of Ukraine that they really want to try and take. So we've been seeing that buildup of troops. We've been seeing them refocusing and regrouping. And what we're hearing now is that there is fierce fighting going on around that sort of 500 kilometers or so of front line. It stretches from Harkiv in the northeast all the way down and around to Mariupol, that strategic port city in the south. And here in Ukraine last night, the president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that as far as he was concerned, that new phase of this war had now begun. Can we talk about what President Vladimir Zelensky spoke about in that video that he released two citizens? He talked about withstanding that they could withstand this new advance. But what is your feeling amongst the people there? What's your sense of what people believe is possible? Well, people believe here very strongly that Ukraine can defend itself. They have seen things like the Russian flagship, the Moskva be sunk by two Ukrainian missiles. They have seen places like Kiev, cities like the capital, which Russia really pushed on. They have seen places like Kiev, you know, cities like the capital, which Russia really pushed on. They have seen their Ukrainian troops defend it. So at the moment, I think the sense of national pride is very high. But of course, that only gets you part of the way. And what Volodymyr Zelensky also said is that they need weapons. Of course, they're depleted now. This war is 55 days old. They have lost men. They have lost equipment. Both sides have, to be fair. But what lost equipment. Both sides have to be fair. But what Ukraine are saying is we need to restock. We need to resupply. We need the world to send us more weapons, more ammunition, more sophisticated things like missile defense systems, armored vehicles. They are saying now is the key. They say they've got the heart, but they need the equipment if they're going to try and hold Russia back. And you're in Kiev, the capital, at the moment. And after a couple of weeks of relative calm there, there were airstrikes over the weekend. What are things like in the capital? Well, it's really interesting, because you can see out behind me now, it's still quite a dark capital. There is a curfew at the moment, so you can't go out on the streets after dark, right through until the early hours of the next morning. And as you move around the city, you will still see things like roadblocks, sandbags, you know, those shelters that people have ready to go to when the air sirens sound, which they still do with regularity here in Kiev. But actually, what is interesting is that people are starting to come back to this city in small numbers. You start to see small cafes, restaurants, some shops are starting to reopen. But actually the mayor of Kiev, the former professional boxer Vitale Klitsko, is asking people not to come back too soon. He says that actually the Russian threat is still there. You've seen these strikes over the last few nights. He says if you are not in Kiev at the moment, just delay returning. He's asked people for now to stay in safer places. We can't thank you enough for your time this morning. And I've got about 30 seconds. But one final question before you go, the UN Secretary of General is calling for a four-day humanitarian ceasefire. What's your sense about whether this will actually happen? I have to say, I don't think it will. I mean, for the last three days, they haven't even managed to establish humanitarian corridors to get people out of those besieged areas safely. Last week, we were seeing eight, nine, ten maybe a day. For the last three days, we've seen none at all. So if that is the situation, I think it would be, despite the fact that Orthodox Easter is coming up in a few days, I think it would be highly unlikely if that call for a truce is actually recognised here. Gosh, yeah, that's just tragedy. Thank you so much, Anna, for your time this morning. Anna Foster of BBC reporter out of Keeve. Please keep yourself safe. Thanks again. We're at 19 minutes past six. In 2019, Labor announced a $1.9 billion boost in funding for mental health. Now, three years on, National is saying that money has made little to no difference, and they want the auditor in general to look into mental health spending. The opposition has called for an investigation which follows the release of a damning report by the Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission last month, which found the system is not changing fast enough for young people, Māori and Pacifica. So for more, we're joined by the Mental Health Foundation's Chief Executive Sean Robinson. Morena, Sean, I'd just like to start this off by saying, Morina, great to have you with us this morning. Hey, look, what's your take on the mental health and addiction system at the moment? Are the right changes happening at the pace that you had hoped for? Absolutely not. I mean, I think the Well-being and mental health commissions report is pretty accurate. Not much has changed for many people at all. And I think, you know, we really have not got the systematic change that we're looking for and a lot of time has been wasted. We are starting to get some traction now, but, you know, Arama, it's been nearly three years since those commitments were made. And, you know, frankly, there's been too many drop balls. Sean, we're looking, so you're saying absolutely not. So there's little to no change in a lot of areas, which is what the report said. But one thing that really stuck out to me are the statistics that have actually got worse. So Māori treatment and solitary confinement, that's gone up and is sitting at now 48%. What do you think is behind that? And how is that justified? Well, it's not justified at all. And in fact, you know, solitary confinement sec seclusion, you know, needs to end. And it's an official policy that it should be coming to an end. What's this as a sign of is a system of services that is massively under pressure. And I think, you know, what most people don't realize is that over a million people each year in New Zealand will experience a diagnosable mental illness. Now that's coming from the Ministry of Health's own statistics, yet most politicians on each side of Parliament really don't take that on board so that that 1.9 billion sounds like a lot of money, but it was never, ever enough. In fact, it was only about half of what was needed to make up the gap and lost funding from the previous 10 years. So you can't really expect that that is going to have made a significant difference to an issue that's that big and that neglected. Sean, we have over the year, put through a series of OIA requests to the government to see how that $1.9 billion of funding was spent. So a breakdown, a financial breakdown in the report, basically. So $127.5 million, which went to corrections, 138.9 million to MSD, victim support in the justice system, got up $1 million. But the key things here is $455 million went to service providers on the ground. So we are seeing at least a significant amount of that funding trickling down to the front line where the real change needs to happen. You say it's not enough. What else is a barrier between seeing stronger and faster change? Well, you know, that 450 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the need. You know, people with these numbers sound big to the average person, but they're actually minute compared to the spending in health. But, you know, really you can't just throw money at services and magically grow new staff. It takes time to train staff. It takes time to set up services. It takes time to expand them. And, you know, when I'm talking time, you know, we're talking years. You know, this is a situation that has emerged over decades and decades and decades. Mental health has never been really acknowledged as the issue that it is and given the resources that it deserves. But, you know, there are been some big drop balls. The mental health inquiry said you've got to do three things, not just one, not just invest in services. You actually do need to put money into the things that cause mental distress, like family violence, like housing, like poverty. You also need to invest in building up the community's ability to look after each other and to look after ourselves. There are so many things that we can do in our everyday lives to boost our mental health. And I know this because I live with bipolar disorder. And for me, the lifestyle things that I adopt are equally as important to me being well and staying well as are the medications that I'm on. And yes, the third thing is absolutely invest in services. So that $1.9 billion, you know, was never enough to do all three of those things. And in fact, one of the recommendations of the inquiry was that there be an investment strategy for mental health. So ongoing investment over time. We just haven't seen that. And if we don't see more investment in mental health in the budget that's coming up in May, you know know I think the whole of the country will be very disappointed Sean are you concerned that perhaps the transformation strategy or the plans have been disrupted by or lost in the COVID-19 response in the broader health reforms oh look absolutely I mean no one can be blamed for the COVID response. That was a curveball out of left field. I will say that, you know, we had already lost a year of mismanagement of implementing the wellbeing budget by that time. You know, look, the health reforms, there's a lot to be said for them, but one of my biggest concerns is that the momentum for transforming mental health will get lost in that much bigger change process. You know, transforming mental health is like changing the tires on a three-trailer Mack truck while it's speeding down the highway at 120Ks. Now the health reforms are like they're rebuilding the highway at 120ks, now the health reforms are like they're rebuilding the highway at the same time. You know, it's a huge amount to try and manage. And, you know, at the moment when I say, who was responsible for mental health out of all these new structures within the health system and how is each structure responsible for mental health, no one could give me a clear answer and that is very concerning. Sean Robinson, we thank you for joining us this morning. Sean Robinson, that's the chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Now coming up just after the break, Johnny Depp's taking the stand in his defamation case against his ex-wife. We'll find out what he's saying in your 630 news next.

Welcome back to breakfast. It's 6.30. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern still has a few stops to make in her whirlwind Singapore trip before heading to Tokyo tonight for more trade talks. Political editor Jessica Muchmecichai is travelling with the business delegation and government officials and send this update. Overnight the Prime Minister went to visit a garden here in Singapore and it really was a chance to showcase Singapore and some of the beauty that it has to offer but also send a message that Singapore too, like New Zealand, is open for business again. This unveiling today is just so special to us because it marks the reopening of our doorway to the world and to Singapore. One of the announcements on this trip has been an extension to the working holiday visa program between Singapore and New Zealand. New Zealand has extended the number of Singaporeans who can come over and work and travel from 200 to 300. While we have worked together through virtual means over the past two years, nothing beats face to face. And so, let me finish with a shameless plug. Visit us. The day to day will be spent here in Singapore with a big focus on business, and then later on tonight we will be heading to Japan. So we'll keep you updated on all the developments. As we go to air this morning, actor Johnny Depp is taking the stand in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. This is a live shot from the trial in Virginia, where Depp is taking the stand in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. This is a live shot from the trial in Virginia where Depp is suing Hurd for $50 million after she wrote an op-ed claiming Depp abused her. In court, Depp says this is his first opportunity to talk about the case and that he is obsessed with the truth. And one day you're Cinderella, so to speak, and then in 0.6 seconds you're Quasimodo. And I didn't deserve that. Depp claims that herds' op-ed led to financial losses, such as being dropped by the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise in which he starred. A 22-year-old man's died in a crash south of Christchurch. Three vehicles, including two motorcycles, are believed to have collided at an intersection on State Highway 75 last night. Another person was taken to Christchurch Hospital in a serious condition. The 22-year-old died at the scene. The National Party is calling for the auditor general to look into the government's mental health spending. It comes after the Mental Health and Well-Being Commission reported last month services aren't changing fast enough for young people, Māori and Pacifica. The Mental Health Foundation's chief executive, Sean Robinson, says not much has changed at all. We really have not got the systematic change that we're looking for and a lot of time has been wasted. We are starting to get some traction now, but, you know, Arama, it's been nearly three years since those commitments were made. And, you know, frankly, there's been too many drop balls. Russian and Ukrainian forces have clashed on the front line in the eastern Donbass region. A long-anticipated offensive in the east is now well underway with Moscow, claiming it struck more than a thousand targets overnight. Russian forces have also captured the city of Kremlin, with Ukrainian cities, troops rather, withdrawing from the city, according to local authorities. What we're hearing now is that there is fierce fighting going on. Around that sort of 500 kilometres or so of front line, it stretches from Harkiv in the northeast all the way down and around to Maripal, that strategic port city in the south. And here in Ukraine last night, the president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that as far as he was concerned, that new phase of this war had now begun. Two sport and Liverpool have the chance to go. said that as far as he was concerned, that new phase of this war had now begun. Two Sport and Liverpool have the chance to go top of the Premier League table this morning. The Reds sit just one point behind leaders Manchester City and play Manchester United. In about 25 minutes time, United will be without star striker Cristiano Ronaldo, who is on compassionately following the death of his baby's son. Both teams will pause for a moment's silence in the seventh minute, seven being a nod to Ronaldo's shirt number. This is the worst that can happen. I'm a father of two sons myself, so I'm fully aware what that means. And we're all behind him, we're all with him and we wish just him and his family that they are strong together. Nice. News for 630. Only in America could you live stream the court proceedings, eh? And it was quite hard to watch to be fair. Yeah, don't worry about potentially saying anything that's, you know, off limits. But, yeah, the fact that anyone can just tune in and watch it, it's nuts. Hello, this is America. Yeah. Chang'am. It's a statement, isn't it? Yeah. Thank you so much for that. Just before we get to your weather, actually, we were having this, looking at what's coming up in the show. We've got Sarah Tuck coming in a little bit later, editor of Dish magazine. And she's looking at some's coming up in the show. We've got Sarah Tuck coming in a little bit later, editor of Dish magazine. And she's looking at some old favourites that she's actually bringing into the modern era. And it was quite funny because it sparked quite a discussion out in our newsroom about the kinds of dishes that you had, while you were growing up, that no one else had even heard of. Like Ollie was talking about, one of our producers was talking about, he used to go to a mate's place who had bread, sugar and milk for their dessert. Which, I mean, in our household, that was one of the staples as well. That was dessert. I mean, that was all you could afford at that time. Like sprinkle the sugar on the bread and dip it in the milk? Like a pudding. No, just a pudding. Yeah, throw it all in there. Yeah. I've got a weird one that I think people find gross, but it's like a dessert in island culture. You basically get, it's called Vaiziani, which basically translates to banana water. And you get bananas that are really yellow like they're about to go off. The sweetest ripe bananas, you put them in a pot of water, you boil them for like two hours until they turn purple and grey, and you add water, you boil them for like two hours until they turn purple and grey and you add sugar and you drink it like soup and I used to love it as a kid but everyone would look at me like what the heck is it? It looks like moment. I can see that tasting good. I mean the purple and grey bit and the boiling it sounds very but sounds better than what Ollie's having at his mates. I mean bread and milk and sugar a bit. Lots of sugar. Anyway, we would love to hear from you if you've got any weird and wonderful for dishes that you grew up with or actually that you've carried on now as a tradition. Breakfast at TVNZ.com.com. NZ. I should have brought my pesto in, actually, that I've just made the other day for Sarah to try. Green fingers. Yeah, with the stuff you grew, I'm sure, eh? Absolutely, my bountiful basil bush. Anyway, I should have brought some in, and that was my error. Anyway, I'll talk to Sarah about that in a minute. Let's have a look at your weather this morning. The humidity you might have felt overnight is set to stick around in the north. All of you are in for showers this morning. That'll ease later today. 24 degrees, the high for Kaitaya and Auckland. And a cloudy start of the day as we move further south drizzle in the Bay of Plenty and the odd shower in Kiddikidoro, Hamilton. 24 degrees you're high. To the east, just some morning cloud in Hawks Bay, but you're in for a mostly fine day, a shower or two possible in Gisbon, 23 degrees high for most of you. And a mostly grey day through here. Some light winds for all showers possible in Tomer Nui and New Plymouth. Some warm temperatures to 27 degrees the high in Funganus. It's like summertime, hey. Yeah, love this jam. You loving the jam? Totally. Yeah. Across to Tewyipon Namu, the South Island, a rainy day in Nelson down the west coast. Thunderstorms possible in Westport and in the east, you're in for some sun. 25 degrees the high in Kikoda. Bit of fog to start the day with in Christchurch. That should lift. It'll be sunny through Omanu. Alexandria, though, you're in for some rain later on. 20 degrees, the high there. And it's a cloudy start of the day in the deep south. Take a raincoat with you if you're heading out later. Some rain for all of you this afternoon and evening. 20 degrees the expected high for Queenstown, Dunedin and Gore. Just sort of good food as well. I might want to discuss later, so I'll hold on to that. Bring your pesto and your tomatoes. You grew amazing tomatoes, nothing like me. Seasons over tomatoes, unfortunately. Well, coming up, we might be over the COVID-19 on McRone Peak, but why are our most vulnerable overrepresented in our death toll?

Welcome back to breakfast. As our COVID death toll continues to rise, Pasifika are dying at an alarmingly disproportionate rate. New Zealand's Pacific people make up 8% of our population, yet account for almost 15% of deaths across the pandemic. It confirms concerns that many Pasifika leaders had voiced early on in the pandemic about the vulnerability of the community. So for more, we're joined by Dr Colin Tukwitonga of the Pacific Expert Advisory Group. Monoina and Pongi, thank you, Dr Tukwitonga for joining us this morning. Can I just preface this interview first by, obviously, we are comparing numbers in the death toll, but I do want to acknowledge that every one of these numbers represents the loss of a loved one to a Fano member here in New Zealand. So when we break down the death toll, every ethnic group in it is represented relatively to the size of their population, apart from Pacifica. Pacifica's representation is almost double its proportion of the population. How do you feel about that, Dr Thucuitonga? Oh, Malo Lele, Endera. Thank you. Obviously, any death for any reason is a tragedy for the family. And as you point out, with COVID, we're looking at deaths in Pacific communities. That's double the expectation as a share of the population. A couple of things first. The classification, I don't want to be too academic, but the classification of deaths is actually quite complex. It includes people who have died within 28 days as well as those shown to have COVID. And people, some people in that 28-day group may turn out to have something else. In other words, they've died with COVID rather than because of COVID. So it's a little missing. But nonetheless, I think the fact that we are overrepresented in the death toll, it's probably a true reflection. Remember, at one time, we were 50% of the cases, particularly here in Auckland. And if we recall, hospital admissions and deaths come some weeks after the cases. And we may well just be looking at a reflection of what happened at that time. In other words, overrepresented in new cases, overrepresented in hospital admissions. And here we are at the tail end. It's probably the reflection of that. Lots of possible underlying reasons, of course, but I think, yes, a concern, but perhaps not unexpected. Yeah, and I want to bring it back to the point that you made about the complexity of the way that the deaths are explained, and you make a good point there, especially with communities like Pacifica and Māori, we're very vulnerable in the sense that we have high rates of statistics in complex diseases like NCDs and diabetes, these that are exacerbated when someone does get COVID. But in saying that, that always put these communities on the back foot. And I remember you, Dr. Thukwetong, along with many other Pacific leaders at the time this pandemic came, warning leaders saying that we need to be prepared to protect our most vulnerable. There were criticisms of the vaccine rollout among Māori and Pacifica. There was a slow uptake, which was boosted very late into the Delta outbreak. There were language and cultural barriers. And now we are looking at 55% of hospitalisations being made up of Māori and Pacifica. Was enough done to prevent what we're seeing today? I think you've obviously highlighted the problems we've had trying to draw attention to the fact that Mardi and Pacific do bear the brunt of the pandemics, and it's the same every time. It was the same in 1918. In other words, I had hoped that we would have learned by now. And so we had difficulties with people accessing healthcare and nowhere better illustrated than in the vaccine rollout. Eventually, we got there to the high 90s as a result of communities mobilizing and organizing their own drive-ins, for example. But we're still at a point now where the boosters uptake that's required for protection against Omicron is still not where we wanted to be. In other words, Mardi and Pacifica uptake of the boosters is still low. And I would have expected and would like additional effort, resources, support to get the boosters lifted. It is, of course, difficult for everyone in Ata Aroa, but nonetheless, I think that's something we need to do to try to mitigate the cases and the admissions that we see. And even young ones, vaccination rates for our 5 to 11 year olds is still way below. In other words, we are still looking at gaps or weaknesses in our response in trying to protect our most vulnerable. Well, the statistics that you were mentioning certainly shows some inequities in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking back, what would you change? How would you do things differently? Oh, I'm on the record saying I think overall our national response is world-class, fantastic overall. What was missing was we should have had a dedicated program, particularly for vaccine rollout for Māori and similar for Pacifica communities designed and delivered with Pacifica leaders and providers from day one. In other words, what we did was we pretty much relied on what we've always done and halfway into the process we realized we weren't making progress. So we doubled back and tried to try to remedy when in fact we knew that this, the effectiveness was highly questionable and we should have had a dedicated effort from day one, firstly, and secondly, important to have leaders and Pacific providers lead and design. Because towards the end of last year, when we saw all those drivers, you know, the Tongans out at Favona through the church and everyone, that's when the vaccination rates lifted. And we got to the high 90s for both the first and second doses. And of course, we took the foot off the pedal and now we see our booster rates lingering behind the rest of our terror.

That's not all, though the Russia-Ukraine conflict has entered a new phase, you could say, and Boris Johnson's apologising once again to his MPs for breaching COVID rules. But let's kick things off in the Solomon Islands. So China says that it's signed a security agreement with the Solomons, and there's big concern that this could see Beijing establish a military presence in the Pacific. Not only is that concerning for us here in El Tiroa, but also for the US and Australia. The government there said they were deeply concerned by the deal. Now, Australia's Pacific Minister did try to stop the deal going through. He travelled to the capital Honiara to try and convince Prime Minister Manisei Sogavari not to sign it. But that bid was unsuccessful. The deal went ahead. And timing's everything, isn't it, just days before senior US officials were set to visit the Solomons for the same reason as the Aussies. China's foreign ministry announced the agreement in Beijing last night. The Solomon Islands PM is set to make a formal announcement later this week. Now, to Ukraine, a long-awaited military offensive from Russian troops in the east of the country is underway. They've seized the city of Crimea in the Donbass region. Now, this is the first city to be captured in the operation. Missiles have had a number of cities across the country in recent days, killing dozens of people. At least three have been killed and 16 more injured after shelling hit the eastern city of Kharkiv overnight. The mayors described that attack as non-stop bombardment of civilian districts. And fleeing civilians are still without humanitarian corridors to evacuate safely for the third consecutive day. Now, finally, to the United Kingdom, where Boris Johnson's Partygate saga just keeps going. In the last hour, the British Prime Ministers apologised again for breaking lockdown rules in 2020. Johnson, his wife and Chancellor Rishi Sunok have paid fines for attending a surprise birthday party in June 2020 during a very strict lockdown over there in the UK. The PMs repeatedly denied he broke the rules or knew that he was breaking the rules. Here's what he had to say for himself in Parliament today. It did not occur to me then or subsequently that a gathering in the cabinet room just before a vital meeting on COVID strategy could amount to a breach of the rules. I repeat, that was my mistake and I apologise for it unreservedly. It is precisely because I know that so many people are angry and disappointed that I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people. So he is just wanting to get on with the job after that one, but he's not the only politician over there that's being told off this week. Earlier Scottish First Minister, Nicholas Sturgeon, apologised after being spotted not wearing a mask in a barbershop, which until Monday was required in Scotland. That apology coming after. Police reminded her of the importance of wearing a face covering when there's a legal requirement to do so. And that's it. Nice, Grace. Nauty. Yeah, nice, Grace. They need a telling off if they're breaking the rules. Yeah, but how many times do you have to apologise until something's actually done about it? Yeah, exactly. Appreciate your time, Grace, Anne, for that international wrap. Thank you so much. Your 7 o'clock news is coming up shortly. Just after that, we have National Leader Christopher Luxon joining me in the studio, and we're going to talk about mental health spending. National has called for an investigation into the $1.9 billion of mental health funding that was allocated to the sector in 2019. Where's the money going? Why are statistics getting worse? So we're going to put that to Christopher Luxon coming up in around about five or so minutes time. But right now it is just going 7 o'clock. So here is your news with Chris Chang. Thanks, Jenny Mae. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern set to head to Tokyo this evening in the next part of her first overseas trade trip since early 2020. Three members of the New Zealand delegation will not be travelling to Tokyo with the Prime Minister after testing positive for COVID-19. One of the final engagements in Singapore was the unveiling of a symbolic carving marking the friendship between the two countries. Political editor Jessica Muchmukai is covering the trip and says it's been a whirlwind so far. One of the announcements on this trip has been an extension to the working holiday visa program between Singapore and New Zealand. New Zealand has extended the number of Singaporeans who can come over and work and travel from 200 to 300 and they'll be able to start applying in May. So that was one of the announcements that the Prime Minister has made here in Singapore. Part of the Prime Minister's discussions with leaders on the trip is stability in the Indo-Pacific. Now China's government says it's signed a security agreement with Solomon Islands. The deal that could see Beijing establish a military presence in the Pacific sparked concern from both the Australian and New Zealand governments as well as the US. The announcement comes just days after Australia's Pacific Minister visited Honiara in an effort to get Solomon Islands to back away from the agreement. China claims it'll help keep peace in the region. The two sides will cooperate in areas such as maintenance of social order, protection of people's lives and property, humanitarian assistance and natural disaster response, in an effort to help Solomon Islands strengthen capacity building and safeguarding its own security. The Australian government says it's deeply disappointed the deal's been signed, saying there's no need for Beijing to play a security role in Solomon Islands. US officials are set to visit Honeara next month. There's a disproportionate rate of Pacifica dying with COVID-19. New Zealand's Pacific people make up 8% of the population, yet account for almost 15% of deaths across the pandemic. Colin Tokuotonga from the Pacific Expert Advisory Group says the COVID-19 vaccine rollout needed dedicated Pacific efforts from the Pacific Expert Advisory Group says the COVID-19 vaccine rollout needed dedicated Pacific efforts from the start. Still at a point now where the boosters uptake that's required for protection against Omicron is still not where we wanted. Russian and Ukrainian forces have clashed on the front line in the eastern Donbass region. A long-anticipated offensive in the east is now well underway, with Moscow claiming it struck more than a thousand targets overnight. Russian forces have also captured the city of Kramina, with Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the city, according to local authorities. To sport and the northern stars have the chance to make up some ground in the ANZ Premiership tonight. COVID-19 has disrupted much of the Auckland-based side season. They've only played three games so far, while some other sides have played six. Despite limited game time, the stars sit forth on the table and take on the tactics tonight. The Northerners beat the Canterbury side 63-51 last weekend. Former Kiwis 5'8th, Tamare Martin, is said to make an incredible return to the NRL this weekend. Martin was forced to retire from rugby league in 2020 after Scans rather revealed bleeding in his brain. Martin's since been given the all clear to play again. He was snapped up by the Brisbane Broncos in the preseason and his name to start at fullback against the Bulldogs on Friday night. Amazing recovery. Take a look at your weather this morning. That humidity that might have been felt around the north is set to stick around. All of you are in for showers this morning. That'll ease later today. 24 degrees the high for Kaitaya and Auckland. And a cloudy start of the day as we move further south. Drizzle in the Bay of Plenty and the odd shower in Kiddikur, Hamilton. 24 degrees the high there. To the east, just a morning cloud on Hawke's Bay. But you're in for a mostly fine day, a shower or two possible in Gisbon. 23 degrees the high for most of you. A mostly grey day through here, some light winds for all of you in showers, possible in Thomaunui and you Plymouth, some warm temperatures to 27 degrees the high in Fonganui. Across two, Therwai Pohnamu, the South Island, a rainy day in Nelson and down the west coast. Thunderstorms possible in Westport, in the east. You're in for some sun, 25 degrees the high in Ginghamu, the South Island, a rainy day in Nelson and down the west coast. Thunderstorms possible in Westport. In the east, you're in for some sun. 25 degrees the high in Kaikola. And some fog to start the day in Othotahe, Christchurch. That should lift, though. It'll be sunny through Omeru. Alexandra, you're in for some rain later in the day. 20 degrees you're high. And it's a cloudy start of the day in the deep south. Take a rain coat with you if you're heading out later. Some rain for all of you and for this afternoon and the evening, 20 degrees be expected high for Queensland and Gore. Jenny May. Nice. Thank you, Changman. It is five minutes past seven. Earlier in the show we heard from Mental Health Foundation's Sean Robinson who said not much has changed or improved for New Zealanders despite a $1.9 billion investment in mental health three years ago. His comments echoing those from the National Party, calling for the order to general to look into mental health spending. For more on that, let's bring in our leader Christopher Luxon, who joins me in studio this morning. Morina, good to be with you, right? Lovely to have you in studio. Why are you calling for this investigation? Well, look, I think the bottom line is that mental health is a major issue for all Kiwi's. One in five of us are going to have a mental health issue, either our family, our friends, ourselves over our lifetime. I don't think it's a party political issue. It's a Kiwi New Zealand-wide issue. I personally want to have a dedicated mental health minister and Matt Doocy, who's a mental health practitioner, build his career in that way, because I think it needs really dedicated focus in New Zealand. It's been a lost agenda, I'd say, for 30 years in New Zealand. So the bottom line is we're very supportive for spending the $2 billion on mental health, but what's come out very obviously is we haven't got any outcomes for it. And I think that's a real worry and a concern. And so all Matt's been asking for quite reasonably is say, hey, listen, could the Mental Health and Well-Being commission come before the select committee? If it's not them, could it be the Ministry of Health and more recently the auditor general? Because when you spend $2 billion and you don't improve any effectiveness of services, that's a big problem. If you've got a 17-year-old that needs an assessment and you can't access those assessment services, we want to know why that's not happening. And I want to talk about that underinvestments prior to this $1.9 billion being invested by the current government. But there have already been six investigations done into that spending. So what are you hoping to uncover? That already hasn't been uncovered. Well, we haven't really got a straight answer. I think as parliamentarians, you know, where we've all been very supportive of spending the money. It's not clear as to where has it exactly gone. How do you not get as to where has it exactly gone? How do you not get $2 billion to the front line? How does it get lost somewhere between spending the money and not actually getting frontline services improved? And so I think that's just a good thing from a parliamentarian point of view to hold the government to account to actually say, look, the $2 billion. And I think you find broad party political support for all of that. We really want to understand how do we actually get improved outcomes. And that's the message here, is that the government often says we'll spend money, whether it's $6 billion on education, but we get worse outcomes. We spend $2 billion on mental health, and we get no improvement in outcomes. It's actually about outcomes because that's what makes a difference to people's daily lives, and that's the thing that we're there to do in politics. I do want to acknowledge that the report does say that the government has made a positive start and that it would take some time for this investment to translate into services into the community. That's a fair call, isn't it? Given that we have been in the midst of a pandemic for the last two years, it does take time. Because you're talking about a sector that has been underfunded for years. So it's going to take time. I understand the sector well, because my mother's a psychotherapist counselor and has been in that world for a long time. And you're right, it has been underfunded for a long period of time. But also, you've actually got to work as government with community organizations to actually deploy and get those services out to the community. We come from a place where we actually think, you know, community organizations see the pain, the hurt, the frustration, the need. We should be using those organizations, scaling them up, getting the money to them so they can actually build more scaled support and services out to the community. Sometimes I feel government wants to control and centralise everything centrally from Wellington and actually not partner well enough with different community organisations to get that cash out there to get those services improved. Earlier this morning, Endera spoke to Sean Robinson, Mental Health Foundation's chief executive. He acknowledged that the $1.9 billion has never been enough. It's not enough. Never been enough in terms of investment. But it's just catching up on the years of underfunding. So, if we look at the funding that's been put into it, he also says that there needs to be even more. Even though that sounds like a lot of money to most New Zealanders right, it is a drop in the bucket for what is required for mental health in this country. So then, what would National do in order to look at the mental health problems in this country? Well, the first thing I'm going to do is actually make sure we have a dedicated minister of mental health. We don't have that today. It's under the auspices of a broad health agenda. And as a consequence, I think mental health has been a second class sort of health priority relative to other health priorities that we've got going on in physical health. And so I think the reality for me is having someone like a Matt Ducey who is a mental health practitioner. That's where he's built his career before he came to politics. He's deeply passionate about it. He actually leading that charge and being able to coordinate mental health, not just in a mental health sense, but actually through other portfolios across government is actually very important. So I think that's the first thing. You get dedicated focus, dedicated accountability. And then you're right, you've got to make sure that you're putting the investment in place. But I'd just say to you, there's a big, you know, this government has a tendency to make an announcement and put an allocation of budget or spend some money. But actually the difference is that's not the success. The success is outcomes. And so it is a long journey. There's a need for a huge amount of investment. There's a lot that's really hard work. Don't get me wrong, it's going to take a long time. But we've got to work with community organizations. And I go up and down the country. I try and go to two or three towns a week. I often meet with community services folk who are in this space. And for them, it's about how they get proper long-term contracts in place with the way they work with government so they can actually get the security of getting the resourcing and the staffing in place so they can actually do the work that they need to do with the front line. You talk about a dedicated health minister I do actually want to move on to inflation and the cost of living. Do you believe that there should be dedication shown towards Māori because if I look at this report, that's come out. While Māori make up 17% of people in Aaltauro, around 24% of those have experienced high levels of psychological distress in the past month are Māori. So what would you do for Māori? Well, look, I think that's the – I mean, but again, you'd partner with organisations that are – that, you know, we saw that in the COVID response. Ultimately, it took time, but ultimately the best way to do it is to actually partner with organisations that can get to the right communities. So we believe that we should target on the basis of need. That means we identify where that need actually is and we work with the right organisations that have those ins with those communities. And so for me, that's what I'm talking about as a partnership between government and community to be able to deliver mental health outcomes and improve services. Okay, can we move on to inflation living? I think we've got about a minute left, my apologies, but according to the government, inflation and the cost of living increases are a global issue. That's not just happening here in Altearo. That's a fair assessment, isn't it? No, it's not a fair assessment. New Zealand has an inflation rate of 5.9%. Australia is at 3.5%. The Prime Minister was in Singapore yesterday. It was at 2%. She's going to Japan today. It's at 1%. They are all facing the same global pandemic issues and all the challenges that we've got in global factors driving a component of inflation. There is things that the New Zealand government can be doing to control domestic inflation. The OECD has been saying for months now you've got to rain in some spending and not make sure you've got wasteful spending going on. We've been saying the same thing. And yesterday you heard Adrian All say the same thing. Don't leave it all to interest rates. Actually government needs to be able to do things to control spending, reduce cost on business and make sure business are more productive. Although can I put it to you that the International Monetary Fund Chief Economists put out a release overnight, talking about the global economic prospects have been severely set back largely because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This crisis unfolds is the global economy has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. It does go on to say even before the war, inflation in many countries has been rising due to supply, demand and balances and policy support during the pandemic, prompting a tightening of monetary policy. So again, isn't that going towards what Grant Robertson is talking about? It's exactly right. There is a global component to inflation that all countries are experiencing around the world. But why has New Zealand got a 6% inflation rate going to about probably 7% tomorrow, while Australia has a 3 and 1, Singapore has a 2, Japan has a 1? They face exactly the same global conditions. There is a big component of this that is domestic inflation, and there's things that government could and should be doing and have been asked to do for several months now. Okay, I'm going to get in trouble because I'm going to go for one more question here. I want to talk about the 50 or between 150,000 and 125,000 New Zealanders that are expected to leave the country in the next year. How do we stop them from going? Well, we've got to build a country that's built on opportunity. You know, when you hear young people saying, I can't buy a house, it's cheaper in Australia, I earn more money in Australia, and the cost of living is almost half what it is in New Zealand. You know, that's we've got to work on those factors to make New Zealand an attractive place to stay. Young people are going to go off and do their OE. That's a fantastic thing. It makes us part of what we are as Kiwis. But we want them to be able to come back here and believe that this is a great country. If you want to do something in your community, if believe that this is a great country if you want to do something in your community if you want to raise a family if you want to start a business this is a place you want to do that where there is opportunity and you can get up and go and actually make things happen you're heading off to fangaree two day safe travels thank you so much for being with us here in the studio in thalmakea makoto Christopher lukson leader of the national party just ahead how the result of the upcoming Aussie election could affect you and what you need to know about it.

Today's Breakfast Brewer is a hugely popular, wonderfully rich, strong and full-bodied, Dilma English Breakfast. New Trade. Welcome back into breakfast. It is 18 minutes past seven, with a month to go before Australians head to the polling booths, election campaignings ramping up tonight. Current Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Labour Party leader Anthony Albanyese will go head to head in the first leaders debate. Beaming in now from Sydney to give us a rundown of the main parties, personalities and policies. We're delighted to welcome Australia correspondent Andrew McFarlane. Back to breakfast. Morena Arun Arnaru, so nice to have you. Thank you for getting up in the middle of the night to be with us here in New Zealand time. You're a good man. Hey, 10 days in, how are things shaping up in this election so far? Yeah, it's only been 10 days but it feels like a lot longer, I have to say, I mean, there's a lot more water to go under the bridge, but so much has already happened on the selection campaign and really all signs are pointing to this being a sticky and a personal campaign too. Okay, talk to me about the sticky and the personal then. What's been going on, Anorou? In one of his first press conferences, well, where do we start, right? In one of the first press conferences, Anthony Albanese, was asked a pretty basic question by a journalist, what's the unemployment rate and what's the official cash rate, right? And politicians are drilled on these things as they head onto the campaign. It's quite common for politicians to be asked what the price of bread and milk is, right? So it's an answer he probably should have had under his belt. And to be fair, he floundered. He got the numbers wrong and he had to come out afterwards and correct himself. Scott Morrison's had a similar gaff in the last week as well, where he got a figure wrong too. But this kind of shows us that the politicians, and also the press over here, are really going to be looking for little slip-ups and that is what it's going to take really to bring one of these politicians down when it comes to polling day. Anato, you have your air to the ground. So after that gaff that Anthony Albanese made, do you think that hurt him at all? Well, it sounds like it might have. Pre-election day and everything, the polls were showing that Anthony Alborizzi was the more popular leader and his party was also in the indefinite lead to win this upcoming election. The polls have shifted in the last week or so. Scott Morrison now has a higher popularity rating and while Labor is certainly a point ahead in the polls, it's looking like it could be a hung parliament. So things are really razor thin. It is still early on in the campaign, obviously, but it really shows how much the public appear to be watching and listening to these little slip-ups. Whether they know about the policy is another question, right? We've had the last three years with Scott Morrison, and he has faced some very public challenges. He had the black summer bushfires. He's had constant flooding here in New South Wales. He's had the climate crisis and, of course, all of the COVID-19 drama too. So I think really the election is coming down to a pretty simple question. Do you want Scott Morrison as leader or do you want the alternative? Yeah, okay. So if you look at that then, Scott Morrison is the current leader or you look at the alternative, then how much of an impact will tonight's leaders debate have on voters? Well, there will be 100 of them in the audience, so 100 people asking questions of the leaders. So there'll be people who are fairly undecided when it comes to the polls, and they'll be asking, hopefully, the questions that average Joe at home wants to know. The reality is, and we know what it's like when a campaign kicks off in New Zealand. A lot of people don't necessarily know the specifics, the ins and outs of the policy. But as we're talking about in New Zealand, there are some key issues we all care about right now. The price of petrol, inflation, housing, those are all issues which are being shared across the ditch here, and there are all things people really want answers to. So really, people will be watching. This is just the first of several electoral debates going forward, but it is, with the polling being so tight, so critical for these two leaders. Yeah, and you rightly point out there are issues going on on Australia that we are experiencing here in Altearoa, in fact, around the world. So let's talk about what the impacts could be on who is elected on us here in Altaroa, Anaru. Yeah, we talked talked in last few weeks about the 501 legislation. That's the law that means for Kiwis over here, and they've been, say, living and working in Australia for 99% of their life. They're basically an Aussie citizen at this point, right? But if they commit a serious crime, they can currently be deported back to New Zealand and effectively blocked from entering Australia in the future. Now, it's a sticky piece of legislation that's really caused leaders to butt heads in the last wee while. Scott Morrison, pre-election, committed to reintroducing some legislation, which were toughen those rules, which some immigration experts warn, could increase deportations of Kiwis by fivefold. So a big change there. Anthony Albanese's party has been a little bit less confident that they would support it. But that is a piece of legislation that if Scott Morrison is re-elected, we can definitely expect to see reintroduced to Parliament. Whether it passes, of course, depends on what the makeup is of the next federal parliament after this election. But that is a key piece of legislation. You also remember, though, around three years ago, Jacinda Ardern was here in Sydney, right? Talking about that special relationship which had been tested. We don't know what it's going to be ago, Jacinda Ardern was here in Sydney, right, talking about that special relationship which had been tested. We don't know what it's going to be like with Jacinda Ardern and Anthony Albanesey. If he wins, that could maybe see some slight defrosting of that relationship too. So really, it is going to be one of those things. Either all, there are two very different approaches likely here to our two countries' relationship. Andrew, just before you go, back to bed, hopefully. I'm just wondering if you can give us a very quick 101 on how elections work in Australia because we know that their system is different to ours, right? Yeah, they've got two different houses. You've got a Senate and you've got your House of Representatives really talking about representatives here. That's the one people are currently voting for. But also what's so bizarre about, and I was talking to a mate about this, where I am, we're in New South Wales, so there's a state election too, and there's also a council election. So really, people have got a lot of opportunities to vote for their representatives here, and it's compulsory not just to register, but to vote too. So the Electoral Commission here in Australia is actually pretty chuff. The enrolment rate here is one of the best they've ever seen on record. 96% of eligible Aussies are enrolled to vote in this election. The day before enrolment closed was the highest number of enrollments they'd ever seen. So it's really shaping up for Aussies really keen to have their say. I think this is an election people are really, really aware of, and something they think they definitely need to weigh in on. Yeah, obviously we're going to be watching with interest across the Tasman. Hey, Andrew, thank you so much. Go back to bed now. Please, please.

Chit-chip and I'm all because of you Yeah Gross I just realized Asparagus sandwiches Are the Asparagus in the can Why would you do that It's so softies It's 29 minutes past 7 You are with Breakfast Thank you so much for your feedback Which we're going to get to After Chris's 730 news We're asking you about your classic dishes You want to just do a cooking show right? Yeah I didn't which we're going to get to after Chris's 730 news. We're asking you about your classic dishes. Just flag the news. You want to just do a cooking show, right? Yeah, I didn't realize we're going to do a cooking show today. This is great. Right up your alley. We're talking about classic dishes that you do at home. Sarah Tucker, the editor of Dish Magazine's coming in just before 9 o'clock to talk about, well, actually, no, not to talk. She's actually going to show us some classic dishes that she's bought into the 80s. Yeah, from the 80s, yeah, bringing them into nowadays, into modern times. Anyway, I was talking about asparagus rolls, and my mother-in-law used to take these along to all the things that she went to. Morena Jocelyn. And these guys have just realized it's the asparagus in a can that you take out, roll up in the old Sammy, and take to a hooey that you're heading to. And they go. They seriously go. Anyway, apart from taking the asparagus out of the actual bread itself, I was trying to figure out, well, how else would you make it? So I totally, a totes thought people just boiled them to death and put them in a slab of bread. And then I'm obviously at the Changrela, the cook is a bit more class and the culinary skills and that sort of thing. So I would probably go for maybe a nice chibata roll or something like that. A bit of garam masala on the asparagus? The canned asparagus? No, no, no, not the canned stuff. Do you make the chabana? No, I'd probably barbecue the asparagus and then put it onto a nice roll. That would be my version of the... You told to shut up. You said up. You said up in radio. We have to do the news. Anyway, classic dishes. Love to hear from you that you make it your place. Breakfast at TVZ.com.com. Right, we'll talk some more food in just a moment, but first, Prime Minister, Justin Ardern, still has a few stops to make in her whirlwind Singapore trip before heading to Tokyo tonight for more trade talks. Political editor Jessica Much McCai is travelling with the business delegation and government officials and sent this update. Overnight, the Prime Minister went to visit a garden here in Singapore and it really was a chance to showcase Singapore and some of the beauty that it has to offer but also send a message that Singapore too like New Zealand is open for business again. The sun veiling today is just so special to us because it marks the reopening of our doorway to the world and to Singapore. One of the announcements on this trip has been an extension to the working holiday visa program between Singapore and New Zealand. New Zealand has extended the number of Singaporeans who can come over and work and travel from 200 to 300. While we have worked together through virtual means over the past two years, nothing beats face-to-face. And so, let me finish with a shameless plug. Visit us. The day to day will be spent here in Singapore with a big focus on business, and then later on tonight we will be heading to Japan. So we'll keep you updated on all the developments. Christopher Luxon says the National Party would introduce a dedicated mental health minister to change the system. It comes as the Mental Health Foundation says despite government funding, nothing has really changed and a lot of time has been wasted. One in five of us are going to have a mental health issue, either our family, our friends, ourselves over our lifetime. I don't think it's a party political issue. It's a Kiwi, New Zealand-wide issue. I personally want to have a dedicated mental health minister and Matt Ducey, who's a mental health practitioner, build his career in that way, because I think it needs really dedicated focus in New Zealand. It's been a lost agenda, I'd say, for 30 years in New Zealand. Russian forces have seized the Ukrainian city of Kramina, the first to be captured in Moscow's renewed offensive in the east. According to local authorities, Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the area. Forces have been clashing along Ukraine's eastern front line, which stretches 480 kilometres along the Donvas region. And the city of Kharkiv has been hit by Russian shelling overnight. The mayor describing it as non-stop bombardment. The gloves are coming off in the Australian general election, with the first leaders debate kicking off tonight. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is campaigning for re-election. No Prime Minister has served two consecutive terms in 15 years. The election itself will take place in a month from now. Australia correspondent Andrew McFarlane says the public is undecided with a few slip-ups from both candidates. Pre-election day and everything, the polls were showing that Anthony Albrizi was the more popular leader and his party was also in the indefinite lead to win this upcoming election. The polls have shifted in the last week or so. Scott Morrison now has a higher popularity rating, and while Labor is certainly a point ahead in the polls, it's looking like it could be a hung parliament. The election will be held on the 21st of May. Actor Johnny Depp has begun his testimony against Amber Heard saying he's in court to clear his name. Depp is suing his ex-wife for $50 million after she wrote an op-ed claiming Depp abused her. In court, Deb described how his father never left his mother who abused him. He remained a gentleman, and to me as a five-year-old boy, I kept thinking to myself, I kept wondering why does he take it? Depp claims that herds op-ed led to financial losses such as being dropped by the parrots in the Caribbean franchise in which he starred. To breakfast, sport and Liverpool have made the perfect start in their bid to go top of the English Premier League. Just four minutes into their clash against rivals Manchester United, the Reds opened the scoring. Monet, that's a smashing ball, and Salas on on his way and he's rolled it in for Diaz! It's taken Liverpool next to no time! And just moments ago Liverpool extended their lead further. Yes, that's it. Manet, oh that's glorious. Salaf, that's beautiful. Oh, that is gorgeous. A simply sumptuous Liverpool goal. Salaf, that's beautiful. Oh, that is gorgeous. A simply sumptuous Liverpool goal. Very nice indeed. Should Liverpool win, they'll overtake Manchester City on the top of the table. The Anfield crowd also paying tribute to United Striker Cristiano Ronaldo in the seventh minute following the death of his baby son. Nice touch. Take a look at your weather this morning. The humidity you might have felt around overnight is set to stick around in the north. All of you are in for showers this morning. That'll ease later today. 24 degrees, the high for Kaita and Auckland. The cloudy start of the day as we move further south, drizzle in the Bay of Plenty. The odd shower in Kiddikidoro Hamilton. You've got a high of 24 degrees. And in the east, just a morning cloud in Hawke's Bay. But you're in for a mostly fine day. Shower or two possible in Gisbon. 23 degrees, you're high. A mostly grey day through here. Some light winds for all of you. Shows possible in Tomidanu and New Plymouth. Pretty warm temperatures around though, 24, 27 degrees rather in Funganui and across to Tewiponamu the South Island a rainy day in Nelson and down the west coast thunderstorms possible in Westport. In the east you're in for some sun 25 degrees the high there in Kaikoda and some fog to start the day in Ototahi Christchurch that should lift though it'll be sunny through Oamuru. Alexandra you're in for some rain later start the day in Oto Tahi Christchurch. That should lift though. It'll be sunny through Oamaru. Alexandria, you're in for some rain later in the day. You're getting to a high of 20 degrees. And it's a cloudy start in the deep south. Take a raincoat with you if you're heading out later. Some rain for all of you this afternoon and into the evening as well. 20 degrees, the expected high for Queenstown, Dunedin and Gore. Nice. Shot Chris. Yeah, thank you, Chris. And thank you for your feedback around your go-to dishes. Sarah Tuck is joining us a little bit later on in the show to bring some 80s dishes into modern times. We've decided that we can't save the asparagus roll. It's a lost cause. It's a lost cause. I tell you one that we used to do at Christmas, and I know you'll probably go, oh, yeah, whateves. But actually, a number of people have said to me, I don't even know what that is, but strawberries and, like just strawberries and cream, just the old mashing up the strawberries. Mash the strawberries. strawberries and cream, like just strawberries and cream, just, they're all mashing up the strawberries. Mash the strawberries. With the cream, right? And then, like, real cream, not the cream out of the can. Oh, so it's turning your nose up with the cream out of the can. And icing, sugar, and you mix that all up. Okay, yeah. Yeah, most of that would be gone before Christmas dinner. Does the juice from the strawberries affect the cream? No. Well, it does. It makes it yum. Well, I was not, I mean, that's sort of similar vibes to your banana soup brothing that you had going. I would rather eat that, though. I'll tell you what's worse. Trisha, my mum used to make us beetroot jelly. I could never understand why she ruined two of my favourite things by putting them together. Beech root jelly. Did your mum love you, Joshua? Is that the beetroot juice from out of the can? Or... Obsessed with the cans, hey? Obsessed with the cans. No, well, that's what my mum used to love that on a sandwich. Maybe that was amazing. You'd mash it and put gelatin on there? I don't know, but I love this. It would have for stains, wouldn't it? Beachwood and the jelly. Kate. Dad used to put a can of spaghetti on pizzas. I don't see nothing wrong with that, Kate. Really? Yeah. So basically classic foods is just people going into the pantry, finding their cans, and just eating them. Yeah, pretty much. What's this, though, Benjamin, pancakes for breakfast, and then pancake soup for dinner. What is that? Pancake soup. Are you taking the Mickey, Benjamin? I think we might be taking them. Maybe it's just the pancake mix without actually frying it up. Anyway, classic dishes. We would love to hear from you. I used to make a chicken pie when I was a police officer and just take it in on night shift and everybody called it the possum pie. It's because I was from Peopiolpio. Just reinforcing stereotypes about policing pies. All of that. But you used to put potato chips from out of a, you know. You mean like crisp potato chips? And put those over the top of it and then put it in the oven. I like that. This is pretty high, maybe a bit high brow, but classic Chinese dish that Mama Chang would roll out on occasion. Chili crab, and I only say this because I'm trying to bring this cooking show and the news together. A bit of synergy today. Oh, yep, yep. Big dish in Singapore, so obviously Singapore, famous for a lot of things. One of them is marvellous airport, Changi Airport. But if Jessica Muchmikai wants a good Singaporean dish get herself some chili crab. That's a little scoop for her. That sounds cool. It's an absolute mess. If you've got your family coming around you basically just have this big dish of crab that's been chillified and all that sort of thing. And it's just hands and sometimes pliers to break the shells. Wow. Huge mess. Yeah, I think people, there are some like crab shacks now and people put like big bibs around them because it's such a mess. Yeah. So you look like an absolute disgrace and your fingers smell for a while, but, chilly crab. That sounds cool, Chris. Yeah, it's not on a can, that's for sure. You'd probably use crab from the can, wouldn't you? It potentially is some. I'm not a hundred potential on there, but potential. All right, day, Hary Akiangenei, coming up. Mount Ruah Pehu is on volcanic alert. What we can learn from the man studying, Tonga's eruption. The issue might be space. It was closing in on us. It's time to get a four bedroom house.

Tonight, 7.30 on 2. Oh! Oh! Oh! Welcome back into breakfast. At the beginning of this year, Tonga faced a devastating disaster as the Honga Tonga, Hunga ha'apai volcano blew its top. It produced one of the worst volcanic eruptions in more than a century. Since then, volcanic activities lowered, providing Professor Shane Cronin with the perfect snorkeling conditions. And no, it wasn't a tourist activity, but a science excursion. And it turns out we could learn something about volcanic activity here from the work Professor Cronin's doing. And he's joining us now from Tonga to explain. Morena, Professor, thank you so much for being with us. How are you? Morena, Malouille. Everything is fantastic, actually. I've just been on a navy boat up in the northern islands of Tonga. And so pretty exciting stuff, jumping on and off these islands and measuring tsunami run-ups. Wow. Yeah, I do want to talk to you about some of the things that you are doing there to help us better understand volcanic activity. But I want to go back first to the snorkeling. I don't even have an experience that you had. How was that? And what were you able to gather in terms of information about the eruption? Yeah, so the snorkeling was sort of tacked on to a bit of an expedition. We went out with a small boat to check the passages in and out of the submarine caldera just to see if it was safe for larger vessels to enter. So we were tracking around areas where we knew the previous sea floor, and we were measuring what they look like now. And at the end, it's an interesting drop-off. So we also wanted to collect a few rock samples. So myself and a young Tangun fellow jumped in the water and we swam across and collected some samples and then the current kind of drew us across from shallow water into this enormous depth. So the water just disappeared into this sort of purple darkness. Actually went over that spot with a Navy vessel last night and with a Tongan Navy vessel when we went over that edge and it's about 600 metres that drop. Wow. I mean, you know, if you're into snorkeling, that would have been an amazing experience anyway. But as a scientist and what you potentially could have discovered would have been incredible. So what did you discover that, again, potentially could help us understand what happened? Yeah, so I think the key really was the passage we did last night, as well as some of that earlier work. So we've been seeing these very large tsunami coming from the volcano, and we knew that something big had changed on the seafloor. So that could be either a landslide off the side or a change in the so-called caldera, the very big central, bigger than a crater, like a huge area in the centre, about seven kilometers across. And what we've seen is that central portion of the volcano has collapsed inward on itself. The middle part of that caldera is probably something like 1,000 meters deep so 1 kilometer deep. We sailed over an area that used to be an island that was it used to be 140 meters high and we were measuring depths of around 800 or 830 meters deep so you imagine how much change has gone on as the volcano collapsed in on itself and that plus the inrush of seawater and that explosion that generated the major tsunami that we saw. Yeah, well, we know that it was, yeah, it was absolutely devastating for Tonga. Now, I know you've been there for the last several weeks making observations, but I know that you've also been talking to locals about what they've seen, looking at video accounts that they have either posted or have on their phones or with them. So in terms of what you saw when you were snorkeling, that they have either posted or have on their phones or with them. So in terms of what you saw when you were snorkeling and then the accounts of locals, what information have you been able to, or conclusion have you been able to come to as to what happened? Yeah, so I think, so I've been working with the Tongan Geosciences section here. So there are about six new young grads working, graduate students working in that group. And so we've been fanning out across the country, visiting different islands. So we've visited all over the place, taking accounts of people of the events. And so we're getting a timeline. So the one major thing we've learned is that there were a series of smaller events which caused tsunamis, small tsunamis, so that everyone was able to escape. So the typical story is, you know, we went to a small island yesterday morning and they have just a tiny little hill. It's only about 20 metres above sea level. But it's far enough inland. And so they all rushed inland, the whole village rushed inland, and camped out on this hill. Some of the men ran back, grabbed some tarpaulins, and took them back up onto the hill. And they were joking that they didn't have any poles to put tarpaulins up. So there were man poles holding the tarpaulins up over the people as the ash was falling down on them over that night. And so the same kind of story from island to island is that the small tsunamis warned everyone to get away and get to higher ground. And some of the islands, you islands, the pieces of higher ground are very small, but people were able mainly to get out of the way. And we were very lucky to have only about three fatalities from this eruption. Yeah, and I guess the biggest thing from what you're discovering too is that we can be more prepared, right? You're looking at the signs that were there beforehand and how Tonga could have been better prepared for this eruption? So, you know, there were some warnings of tsunami and there was some activity going on for about a month at the volcano before. And I guess people were sort of seeing this as just an extension of that same situation. But when the first big waves came that were much bigger than past ones, and then coupled with that were shockwaves. And so one guy we were speaking to the day before yesterday was sitting on a plastic stool, and he was on an island quite close to the volcano, facing the volcano. He got knocked off his stool and fell back and broke his watch, so he knows exactly the time that shockwave hit. And as soon as that hit, they knew something was very different. And everyone, the village leader was able to get the bell and get everybody moving and everyone took off towards high ground. Professor Cronin, is there anything that we can take from what you are learning there to what's happening back here in Aotearo? We know that there are rising levels of unrest at Mount Ruapehu. So is there anything that we can learn here from what you're learning over there? So Rua Pahou is quite a different volcano in terms of a lot smaller. But with the Rua Pahue system, what kind of system we kind of think about is a pressure cooker so honga has the same sort of thing so in the rural pehu we have like a pressure cooker system where the lid of the pressure cooker is underneath to waia moi so the crater lake so that lid of the pressure cooker has to hold the pressure of the gases coming up underneath. And so what we look at is if that lid is a little bit leaky, then the gases that come underneath can vent out and we don't build up an explosive pressure. But if that pressure cooker lid is sealed tight, then the gas is built out underneath and an explosion occurs. The same sort of thing happened with at Hungar, but on a much, much larger scale, where there is, and below the sea, there is a hydrothermal system, which is full of clays and various other things, and that forms a so-called lid on it, you know, like a pressure cooker seal, and that seal stalls the gases, pressurises the system, and you get an explosion. So with Ru'a Pihu, going back to Ru'iou, there's a cycle of activity there. So the lake warms up, it cools down, warms up, cools down. And that's because the magma below is kind of rising up and gas is rising in. And it just depends on how well that's trapped. And so what we're seeing at the moment is it's risen to a high temperature but there's probably enough venting just at the moment to keep it stable but it's always just a situation of how well that that gas ceiling takes place so we could see a few more of these heating cooling cycles eventually it will it will explode. We know that Roopéhu erupts roughly every 11 years on average through our recorded history. So it will erupt at some stage. Gosh, Professor Cronin, you do some amazing work. Thank you so much for your time this morning. I'm sorry we have to go, but appreciate your time. And thank you so much for talking to us about not only the science, but your experiences there in Tonga that can help us best prepare for the future.

And in the sport, you can't find competitors more skilled than the very talented Bay of Plenty teens who join our one news reporter Sam Coway now. Morena. Morena, goodness me, I tell you what, there's some brain power in this room. I'm feeling very, very under pressure. But these boys are smart and they can do some incredible things. Dom, Nate, Noah, thank you so much for joining us this morning, boys. Dom, very quickly, what is robotics, mate? So it's a competition between generally four robots, two blue and two red, which there's like 15 seconds of coded at the beginning of each game, and then after that you go into a minute 45 of driver control, which is then when the drivers take control and do whatever they need to after their auton has either succeeded or failed. Well, see, there's some technical words being thrown around here, guys, and we'll give you a demonstration later on, so it'll all make sense. Nate, you won the national champs. How was that? It was very fun to do. It took a lot of work, and we're very nervous to do it, but it was great. Yeah. And Noah, you're off to Texas, right? Next month, only a few weeks away. What are you hoping to achieve over there? Hoping to win, obviously. But realistically, dream would be to get into the finals or division finals. And how much works goes into this, guys? I know that you've got, you know, you've got to save a lot of money to get there, and you're all trying to fundraise to get those funds. But in order to get your robots to this spec and to be able to do what they can do, what goes into that, Don? So we've been working on our robots since about March last year. March last year. Yeah. Wow, that's a really long time. And you've got a really busy job. You do lots of stuff. There's like donuts and goals and all sorts of things you've got to get. How tricky is your job, Nate? It's pretty difficult. Yeah, you've got to get the robot ready to do everything and just get it up to level to compete for every competition. Okay. Well, Marty's going to follow me around. We've got to go, but thank you so much, boys. Stay there. These geniuses here are programming these robots over here. And just before 9 o'clock, we'll give you a demonstration of how clever these boys are. And you wait to you see these robots in action. It's incredible. Stick around. Nice, Sam. Yep, the geniuses that you're standing next to you. I love, though, they were looking at you like, what do you mean, mate? This is just easy. This is all very simple. Yes. Anyway, it's just gone 8 o'clock. So here's Chris with your news. Thanks, Tim. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern set to head to Tokyo this evening and the next part of her first overseas trade trip since early 2020. Three members of the New Zealand delegation will not be travelling with her to Tokyo after testing positive for COVID-19. One of the final engagements in Singapore was the unveiling of a symbolic carving marking the friendship between the two countries. Political editor Jessica Muchmikai is covering the trip and says it's been a whirlwind so far. One of the announcements on this trip has been an extension to the working holiday visa program between Singapore and New Zealand. New Zealand has extended the number of Singaporeans who can come over and work and travel from 200 to 300, and they'll be able to start applying in May. So that was one of the announcements that the Prime Minister has made here in Singapore. Russian and Ukrainian forces have clashed on the front line in the eastern Donbass region. A long anticipated offensive in the east is now well underway, with Moscow claiming it struck more than a thousand targets overnight. Russian forces have also captured the city of Kramina, with Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the city according to local authorities. What we're hearing now is that there is fierce fighting going on. Around that sort of 500 kilometers or so a front line it stretches from hakev in the northeast all the way down and around to maripole that strategic port city in the south and here in ukraine last night the president volodomere zelensky said that as far as he was concerned that new phase of this war had now begun a new zealand scientist has snorkeled around the Hungatonga-Hunga-Hapai volcano. At the beginning of this year, the volcano produced one of the most significant eruptions in more than a century. After volcanic activity lowered, Professor Shane Cronin was able to see what changes had resulted from the eruption. We knew that something big had changed on the seafloor. So that could be either a landslide off the side or a change in the so-called caldera, the very big central, bigger than a crater, like a huge area in the centre, about seven kilometres across. And what we've seen is that central portion of the volcano has collapsed inward on itself. that central portion of the volcano has collapsed inward on itself. The middle part of that caldera is probably something like 1,000 metres deep, so one kilometre deep. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended his lockdown-breaking birthday party, saying he didn't knowingly break the rules. The Prime Minister, his wife and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, all paid fines for attending the celebration in June 2020 during a strict COVID-19 lockdown. Johnson apologized to Parliament today and insisted he's getting on with the job. Precisely because I know that so many people are angry and disappointed that I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people. MPs will vote on Thursday on whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for misleading Parliament. To sport and Liverpool are well on their way to knocking Manchester City off the top of the English Premier League table. The Reds scoring with ease in the first five minutes in their clash against Manchester United. Moments later, they doubled the lead. That's it. Yes, that's it. Manet. Oh, that's glorious. Sarah! That's beautiful! Oh, that is gorgeous. A simply sumptuous Liverpool goal. Liverpool currently lead 2-0. The Anfield crowd also paying tribute to United Striker Cristiano Ronaldo in the seventh minute following the death of his baby son. The Wellington Phoenix need wins in their final four A-League matches if they're to make the playoffs. The Phoenix sit in fifth spot on the A-League ladder with MacArthur FC one point behind them and Sydney FC two points behind. Wellington play the Western Sydney Wanderers on Sunday at Eden Park in Auckland. Stryker Joshua Saterio says every game from here on out is a must win. We stay positive even though we lose games, but the mentality here is to try and win every game and make tough, as I said, and have some home games here in the finals. All right, let's have a look at how your weather is shaping up this morning. A bit of humidity overnight for some. It might stick around in the north and you get in for showers this morning. That'll ease later today though. 24 degrees, the high for Kaitaya and Auckland. And a cloudy start of the day as we move further south. A bit of drizzle in the Bay of plenty, the odd shower in Hamilton. 24 degrees, your high. And in the east, just some morning cloud in Hawks Bay. But you're in for a mostly fine day. A shower or two possible in Gisbon. 23 degrees the high for most of you. A mostly grey day through here. Some light winds for all of you in showers possible in Tomeinanui and New Plymouth. Some warm temperatures around 27 degrees are high in Funganui. And across to Tewa Pornamu, the South Island, a sunny day for Nelson. And down the west coast, thunderstorms possible in Westport in the east. You're in for some sun there, 25 degrees the high in Kaikoda. And some fog to start the day in Christchurch. That should lift, though. It'll be sunny through Uwamuru. Alexandra, though. You're in for some rain later on in the day. 20 degrees you're high and cloudy start of the day in the deep south. Take a raincoat with you if you're hitting out later. Some rain for all of this lot in the afternoon and evening. Pretty mild temperatures though, 20 degrees expected for the likes of Queenstown Dunedin and Gore. Yeah, still mild temps considering the wet weather. Look, just ahead, I love this.

No, my hook and my, welcome. Welcome back to breakfast. This morning we're talking about the Australian election and we heard earlier about the upcoming leaders' debate, but there is a lesser-known candidate running that we want to introduce you to. So back in 2019, comedian and former radio host, Alex Dyson, made his mark running for the seat of Wannon by using a rather interesting campaigning method. Take a look at this. You, you, baby. Radio line is enough. Radio line is enough. Well, his use a lot. Well, his use of interpretive dance went viral, and even though he didn't win, he is back for a second time, and he's enlisting the help of a TikTok star to engage with voters. This hasn't been released yet, but take a look. Come on, darling. Are you excited with you this, folks? I just started who to vote for. Oh, don't worry about that. I've been doing this for years, and I mean, the world's just fine, isn't it? So just follow my leg. Come with me, it's okay. I'm gonna be. Look, Alex is joining us now from Warnham Bull in Victoria. Kjota, Alex. Hello, I'm really, really sorry. The audio isn't working all that well, so I can't actually hear what you're saying at the moment. It's not coming through for me. Sorry, Dior, can you hear me okay? I can hear you okay. You know, if I could interpretive dance from all my questions back at you, I would totally take a leaf from your book and do it. Can you hear me now? I get it for, dear. This is a deliberate ploy in order to get me to communicate via interpretive dance. There are no need for words when we're struggling with audio district difficulty, but you're right, a couple of years ago, I just got fed up with politicians and decided that they lie too much. And so I thought, given that my hips don't lie, I thought I'd better put them out on the big screen and try and give Australians a different option because, yeah, in Australia, I'm not sure if you watched from afar as we kept having rotating prime ministers. It was a bit of a bloodbath here. At the same time, climate change wasn't being addressed. And so, yeah, a young person jumping up and communicating a little bit differently, I thought would be something that we might be able to get into the mix. And it was such a good time that I'm running again in 2022. Yeah, I love it. Alex, just before I go to my next question, can I just confirm you can hear me now? No, unfortunately, I can't hear you now. I'm doing my best lip-reading impersonation, like honestly. It's all good. But if you communicate with your lads or make big movements with your mouth in DIA I'm sure we'll be able to make our way through this I mean you're a professional broadcast and I'm sure you've dealt with worse in your time on television brilliant nice challenge nice setup hey look we're going to go I think I'm just going to confirm we're going to take a break because we're going to fix that because we definitely want to go, I think I'm just going to confirm we're going to take a break because we're going to fix that. Because we definitely want, or do have, you know, all jokes aside, you're running in this campaign seriously, and we definitely want to touch base on all your campaign policies. We'll be back with you, Alex Dyson. This is a big job. It did take a bit of a tumble down the stairs. Pickery-dickory-dickory dock. Can they save the shattered clock?

We are back with Alex Dyson, who is joining us from Warnable in Australia. Alex is running as an independent candidate in the Australian elections. I hope you caught what happened before the break. His campaign policies are presented through interpretive dance. We might have a little bit of that footage later on as well. But Alex, I just want to say we have one, a fan of yours in the studio. One of our cameraman has actually been watching your YouTube videos, your interviews, for years, actually, the last three years. So it was good to have some... Yeah, unfortunately, we can't vote for you, but based on your interpretive dance, I would have totally given you my vote. So 2019 is when you first stood in the elections. You were serious about it. Were you surprised that you got even, it was just over 10% of the vote? Yeah, 10,000-ish first preference votes was incredible in Dura. It was a testament to, I think, people hearing the spirit of it. I mean, not everyone was convinced by my run. I was handing out my how to vote cards on voting day in Australia, meeting people and an older lady, probably about 80-year-olds, 80s years old, came in and said, oh, the boy that did that dance. I'm like, yes, would you vote for me? It would be great? She goes, no, we've already got enough clowns in Canberra and walked inside. And I've got to say, she was probably right. It was a sick burn from that old lady. But the other response was great. And in fact, a gentleman told me a few weeks ago he gave me the first formal vote he'd done in 40 years he usually just draws genitals on the on the ballot but he said no I voted properly for you because you were a normal person acting like a moron and unfortunately all we've got is morons acting like normal people so he saw the spirit of the campaign and it was really really lovely to get involved and talk to the community and give them another option. Well, listening to your story and looking at your interpretive dance, all I had to say was, Ozzy, no surprises there, mate. But let's talk seriously, though, about your campaign policies. What are they this time around? Well, in Australia, the government at the moment promised to have an integrity commission. I was baffled. And in fact, I only found out recently our parliament doesn't have a code of conduct, let alone an independent body that could investigate any wrongdoing by the politicians. And unfortunately, we've seen over many years in all different types of countries that when you're in those positions of power, it's very difficult sometimes for some people to say, yeah, doing the job that you're elected to do of power, it's very difficult sometimes for some people to say, yeah, doing the job that you're elected to do and that is helping the people without having things in it for yourself. So I'd really love to get an integrity commission in there, an independent, put it in the last election, put a bill forward, it didn't get through. So I'd love to be an independent to help that. I've also felt really, really bad as a young person watching, learning about the greenhouse effect in primary school that's just down the road here and then seeing over the last 25 years not not enough steps put in place a lot of excuses were made rather than forking out a little bit of cost and transitionally naturally I think that's a really big issue for me and as well as that just listening to the community what I've heard are things like housing we've got a massive housing crisis I'm sure it's similar in New Zealand the cost is getting out heard are things like housing. We've got a massive housing crisis. I'm sure it's similar in New Zealand. The cost is getting out of control. Things like mental health and aged care are massive around these regions. But overall, just putting in policies that aren't designed for a single election cycle, but we'll have some long-lasting benefits to the community, I think, some of my main goals. Right, and your policies sound great, but obviously the challenge as well, and we had seen earlier, one of the phrases that you're saying is don't vote like a boomer, but the challenges are getting the huge amount of young people to vote because not a lot of them vote. I saw on your TikTok that you went to the club recently. I'm not talking about the country club, I'm talking about the nightclub. You went to the nightclub and campaigned there. How did people respond to you? It was really great. I mean, obviously, plenty of people are disillusioned with politics. And so you need to hopefully communicate in a way that is a little bit more engaging. And by my past life as a DJ, I hit the decks in my hometown of Honourable wearing my old year six jumper. It was a bit of a cleansing moment for me because I had to hand my jumper down to my younger sister who was in the year after me. So at the end of the year, we'd sign each other's jerseys and you know, you take it as a bit of a memento. So I wore my Warner Primary School jersey to show that I'm a politician that's from the area, an aspiring politician. And it was a great icebreaker that I could say things like, hey, you would roll to vote. And yeah, make sure that their voices heard because you can really feel like the politicians don't care about what you think as a young person. There's been protests around here, particularly climate process. You know, Greta Thunberg's Friday strike for climate when the kids hit the streets, they go out and do that and our politicians say they should be in school learning. I'm like, they currently seem to be learning more about climate science than you sitting in Parliament. And so, yeah, communicating to young people on their level is great. And it's amazing. Voting, it can be really boring. It can feel like it's not doing anything, but it's the single smallest thing you can do that has the biggest impact is voting for someone who is, you know, pro-ambitious climate action. Well, if you've managed to change the voting behaviour of someone who had for 40 years, I showed up to the booth to scribble, you know, things, then that certainly shows that you're making an impact. You're running as an independent candidate, but I did notice that another political party has been kind of sabotaging your campaigns and your posts, your signs. Tell us about that. Well, it's just funny. This is literally yesterday. I put up this video last night because we saw a United Australia Party who was sort of founded by a mining magnate named Clive Palmer and he's been spending about $400,000 a week on YouTube ads. Their signs are everywhere. I don't have quite the budget. So I've got these, there it is, these little signs that some supporters put up on their fences in Australia. You can support a candidate you like on your own private property. But we woke up at a poor old United Australia party and started putting their sides over the top of my signs. I'm like, please don't. That's all I have. I only have the signs in the community and this really grassroots support and yeah, little campaign going on here. So I'll leave Clive to go on the YouTube and the TV and the front page of the newspaper ads and I'll just hopefully have my little signs around the area I'm running in and show that, yeah, that independent candidate can bring a bit of humor and goodwill to it because I don't take it too personally. You know, it's not the dirtiest politics has ever gotten, but yeah, it's one of those little quirks of a campaign, isn't it? It is, we're still Clive as like a billionaire. It's so cheeky. He could really find his own space. Hey, look, we love what you're doing. Also, we wish you all the best. We're sorry we can't vote for you based on your interpretive dance from here, but go well. And yeah, great, great campaign policies. We wish you all the best. Alex Dyson. Thank you, Indyris. Thanks so much for having a chat to me and all the best. You too. Alex Dyson, independent candidate in Australia's local election that's happening right now. Absolutely brilliant. It is 27 minutes past 8. And just before we get to your 830 news with Chris Chang, it's the school holidays. And after two years of lockdowns and intimate family time, you know, as parents, you might be struggling to figure out what you can do to keep your kids busy. Well, Tessa Parker is at the Auckland Art Gallery to find out how you can keep your child's creative spirit alive and at a low cost. Morena, Tessa. Morena, team. That's right. I'm here at Auckland Art Gallery. And, you know, we've all done drawing and painting and colouring in. But I'm here with Sue from the Chartwell Art Trust and from Squigler. And they've come up with this new idea called Markmaking that helps us kind of have joy in the process of making things creatively and just kind of getting stuck in without expectation. So Sue, tell me about mark making. What is it? Kioritester and thanks for coming into the Squigler making space. We're really thrilled to be here at the Auckland Art Gallery. And we're calling this space a gymnasium for the visual. And we all know that we go to the gym to exercise and strengthen our bodies and our muscles. But what might we do in a gymnasium for the visual? Well, we're exercising our creative potential. And the way we do that, in an easy, accessible and very joyful way, is through mark making. So that means marks, dots and lines on the page. Think about the marks, the way they move around the page, the way we physically and emotionally respond to making marks. So we can give it a go while we're here, Tessor, if you like. Yes, please. Why don't you kick us off and show me how you kick off your mark making? Fantastic. Well, while we're here in the Squig show me how you kick off your mark making. Fantastic. Well, while we're here in the Squigler making space, we've got these fantastic overhead projectors, which means that we can actually record and watch our making in the very moment that we're doing it. So this is going to be live on the wall behind us, which is fantastic for us today, because we're going to just start with a dot. And then as we make our dot there and we watch ourselves do it on the page leave your pen on the page and we're just going to think about the way a dot once it starts moving it becomes a line. And think about the line, you might have been a dancer Tessa or you might have been someone who loves walking in the bush or exploring and exercising in different ways. And then think about what happens to that line as we move it around. You might even be a theatre performer who's thinking about the way we move on a stage. And then gradually we start to intersect with each other. And we keep going. Yeah. Now, Sue, I just want to, because these are kind of big, big words and ideas, I guess, for something that we imagine. Not just kids do, but adults do as well. And, you know, these are lovely projectors. But for those who can't come to Auckland, even though this is a free space, but couldn't make it into the art gallery or aren't from here, you know, how do people kind of utilize this kind of thinking and creativity at home? Yeah, well, Squiggler, because it's a hands-on mark-making program, it's available for all ages and all abilities. That's really fundamental to what we, as the Chartwell Trust believe. We really believe in the ideas about participation. So there's really clear links between participation in the arts and our sense of well-being. Fantastic. So we want everybody to be able to do Squigler wherever you are, whether you're in the classroom, whether you come to the gallery, or whether you're at home with your family, especially over the school holidays. Yeah, 100%. Well, thank you so much for creating this beautiful art piece with us. Guys at home, give your mark making a go. And yeah, thank you once again. Happy school holidays, everyone. Yeah, try squigler.org. Nice, nice test. That's you today with your twin boys. Well, no, I'm just thinking about that's actually a good window into mindfulness. Like, you know, talking about well-being, etc. It's actually just allowing yourself not to think about anything else, but doing what you're doing on the piece of paper. But the overhead projector, anybody else? I know. Right. When was the last time I saw one of those was at school. And that's a few haircuts. That's a throwback. All right. It's just gone 831. So here's Chris with your news. Good morning, Prime Minister. Jacinda Ardennes still has a few stops to make in her whirlwind Singapore trip before heading to Tokyo tonight for more trade talks. Political editor Jessica Much McCai is travelling with the business delegation and government officials and send this update. Overnight, the Prime Minister went to visit a garden here in Singapore and it really was a chance to showcase Singapore and some of the beauty that it has to offer, but also send a message that Singapore too, like New Zealand, is open for business again. The sun veiling today is just so special to us because it marks the reopening of our doorway to the world and to Singapore. One of the announcements on this trip has been an extension to the working holiday visa program between Singapore and New Zealand. New Zealand has extended the number of Singaporeans who can come over and work and travel from 200 to 300. While we have worked together through virtual means over the past two years, nothing beats face to face. And so, let me finish with a shameless plug. Visit us. The day to day will be spent here in Singapore with a big focus on business, and then later on tonight we will be heading to Japan. So we'll keep you updated on all the developments. Part of the Prime Minister's discussions with leaders on the trip is stability in the Indo-Pacific. Now China's government says it's signed a security agreement with Solomon Islands. The deal that could see Beijing establish a military presence in the Pacific sparked concern from both the Australian and New Zealand governments, as well as the U.S. The announcement comes just days after Australia's Prime Minister, Pacific Minister rather, visited Honiara in an effort to get Solomon Islands to back away from the agreement. China claims it'll help keep peace in the region. The two sides will cooperate in areas such as maintenance of social order, protection of people's lives and property, humanitarian assistance and natural disaster response, in an effort to help Solomon Islands strengthen capacity building and safeguarding its own security. U.S. officials are set to visit Honeara next month. Speaking before the deal was signed, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said it could set a concerning precedent for the Pacific. We've communicated with our allies and partners in the region, including, of course, with Australia and New Zealand, which have expressed concerns about how this agreement may threaten the current regional security paradigm. Part of the task of the upcoming visit will be to share perspectives, to share interests, to share concerns. The Australian government says it's deeply disappointed the deal's been signed, saying there's no need for Beijing to play a security role in Solomon Islands. Russian and Ukrainian forces have clashed on the front line in the eastern Donbass region. A long-anticipated offensive in the east is now well underway, with Moscow claiming it struck more than a thousand targets overnight. Russian forces have also captured the city of Kramina, with Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the city according to local authorities. Liverpool are 20 minutes away from going to the top of the English Premier League table, the red scoring with ease in the first five minutes, and their clash against Manchester United. Moments later, they doubled their advantage. That's it. Yes, that's it. Marne. Oh, that's glorious. Santa, that's beautiful. Oh, that is gorgeous. A simply sumptuous Liverpool goal. Well, the commentator liked it. Liverpool currently lead 3-0. Should they win, they'll overtake Manchester City on top. The Anfield crowd also paying tribute to United Stryker Cristiano Ronaldo in the 7th minute following the death of his baby's son. The Northern Stars have the chance to make up some ground in the ANZ Premiership tonight. COVID-19 has disrupted much of the Auckland-based side season. They've only played three games so far, while some other sides have played six. Despite limited game time, the stars set forth on the table and take on the tactics tonight. The northerners beat the Canterbury side 63-51 last weekend. Former Kiwi's 5-8, Tamire Martin, is set to make an incredible return to the NRL this weekend. Martin was forced to retire from rugby league in 2020 after scans revealed bleeding in his brain. Martin's since been given the all-clear to play again. He was snapped up by the Brisbane Broncos in pre-season and his name to start at fullback against the Bulldogs on Friday night. Finally, Harry Stiles has just announced he'll be touring Australia and New Zealand next year. Ganga! As you was, as you was. I don't get it. The Grammy Award-winning stars Love on Tour. 2023 will come to Auckland's Mouncemart Stadium in March. Stiles has just taken to the stage as the headline act at Music Mega Festival Coachella in the US. Tickets for his Auckland show go on sale next week. Not sure when we can buy the outfit though. Let's have a look at your weather this morning. But if humidity around that you might have felt overnight set to stick around in the north, all of you were in for some showers this morning that will ease later on. 24 degrees, the high for Kaitaya and Auckland. Cloudy started the day as we move further south. Drizzle for the Bay of Plenty and the odd shower in Kiddikidroa. 24 degrees, you're high today. To the east, just some morning cloud in Hawks Bay, but you're in for a mostly fine day. Shower or two possible in Gisbon, 23 degrees the high for most of you. And a mostly grey day through here, some light winds for all of you in showers possible in Thoma, Inoumintanui. Pretty warm around here, 27 degrees the high in Funganui. You know you want some, Chris Chang. I've just had some cuisine brought into the studio. We'll bring that to you shortly. Across to Tewiponamu, the South Island. A rainy day in Nelson and down the west coast. Thunderstorms possible in westward in the east. Herein for some sun, 25 degrees, the high for Kaikoura, and someward in the east. You're in for some sun. 25 degrees the high fork Kaikora and some fog in Ottajee that'll burn off. It'll be sunny throughout Oamaru. Alexandra though you're in for some rain later on. 20 degrees your high and it's a cloudy start of the day as we go to the deep south. Take a raincoat with you if you're heading out later. A bit of rain about in the afternoon and through to the evening, 20 degrees the expected high for Queenstown, Dunedin and Gore. And what on earth is that? It's the aback 80s throwback dishes. I can literally see meat in there. I think it's beef.. Looks like something from Auckland Museum, doesn't it? I think there's... I love... I love Sarah Tuck. Yes. Although she might have her workout for us this morning. I love it. We're going to do it. And she's such a great sport. She went and did this. Yes. Recipes that were taken out of this good old cordon blue cookbook from a few haircuts ago. Anyway, which we've actually been asking you about some old school dishes that either you grew up with or that you continue to make, etc. So thank you so much for all of your feedback. Actually, somebody has, because you were mentioning, Betrude Jelly. I'll say the Beatrue Jelly now. Yeah, Beatrice Jelly. Actually, somebody has, because you were mentioning, beetroot jelly. I'll say the beetroot jelly now. Yeah, beetroot. Actually, this is Paulette. One KG beetroot, cooked, diced or grated, so not the canned stuff then. One packet of raspberry jelly, boiling water, white wine vinegar, put the beetroot into mould or jars, dissolve the jelly and water, add vinegar, pour over beetroot, allow it to set. I'm not sure about that one, but anyway, you know, whatever the jelly and water, add vinegar, pour over beetrette, allow it to set. I'm not sure about that one, but anyway, you know, whatever. You do you, boo? Yeah, and our cameraman Malcolm, who was just explaining to me that I think it might be a little bit like onion jelly or, you know, kind of an onion relish. And so I kind of thought, oh, well, maybe. That makes sense. But, yeah, anyway, thank you. I still not convinced. They say you are what you eat. I'm not going to be that. Look at that. I think that thing's got scales. No, but you don't actually still not convinced. They say you are what you eat. I'm not going to be that. Look at that. I think that thing's got scale. No, but you don't actually know, Chris Cheen. This is the thing. With Sarah Tuck, who I trust. Totally. Completely. Yeah. We've got to give this a go. Yeah. We're doing it. Sarah Tuck's going to join us. Well, we'll see what she has to say about the rest. Oh, I didn't see the other side. Oh, yeah, there's meat in there. So the side that I'm looking at looks way less appealing than that side. The other side looks a bit more palatable. A big, very rude. This is not how you behave when you come to someone else's table. That's right. Be quiet and just... Anyway, Sarah's going to be joining us as we're going to see the modern version of these 80s dishes. I love it. Stay with us.

Tonight, 7.30 on 2. That's perfect. No, my hokey, my honor. Welcome back to breakfast. When you think of jelly, you probably think of flavors like strawberry, line or orange served for dessert. But back in the 1960s, served inside of that wobbly, jiggly jelly was something that a few of you may remember. Frankfurter's egg, celery and carrots were some of of the favourites, cooked up or chilled, rather, as part of the dinner menu. So what if savoury jello made a return? Here to try and convert us to this redesigned classic, as well as introduce us to some new meals from the latest dish magazine is editorial director. Serra Tere Tuck, Morina, Sarah. Okay, can we just start? This was a challenge that we threw out to you, right? It is. It is. Which is the two dishes that were bought in initially that we all went, what the hell is that? Mm-hmm. Okay. And it was from this cookbook here, which you have done a magnificent job of recreating, but can I also say that you've actually done a modern take, which is a Seratuck take on these two recipes. So, I don't know. Yeah. I mean, what the hell is? Okay. So thanks to the producer for giving me the book to have a look at. There's, this is by Muriel and Rosemary. And it came out, of course, and it came out in 1977 when I was 10 years old. And I mean, I think back now, and my mother hated cooking when I was a kid and I think well if that is what you were expected to do I'm not surprised you know so what I decided to do was to do two dishes pretty much exactly from the book and then yeah two that are both on the website but they're both kind of like our recent versions so for example shall I should I oh please please so this is a salmon moose and rosemary, Muriel, I must apologize to them because I've let them down. I forgot to put the extra mayonnaise on top. I forgot to put it. I forgot to put it on the, I forgot to put it on put it in the car. But this is a salmon moose where you, it's so laborious. You poach some salmon and the stock that you poach it in is pretty flavorless. I mean, it's so laborious. You poach some salmon, and the stock that you poach it in is pretty flaveless. I mean, it's got a bit of carrots and a bay leaf in a little bit of time, so it's not a lot of grunt. And then you poach the salmon and you chill it in that liquid. Then you flake it into cream cheese and you mash it up with cream cheese, mayonnaise, whipped cream, whisked egg white, and gelatin. And then you set it in a cake tin which has been oiled and overnight. And also happily, you can freeze it if you want to make it now. Happily. Take it out of the freezer and, yeah, yeah, let it. Always good to have morphelag. How long did that take you? Oh, I mean, with the faffing, with all of the different components, it took an hour and a half probably by the time I'd coach the fish and eat at chill. To put all the cucumbers in such a stylish manner. Yeah, thank you. What's your modern take on it then? Because this is what I'd rather hear it by. Well, the thing is if you taste that, oh, I forgot. Oh, my God, I forgot one of the most important things. It's also got a bechamel sauce in there. There's so much in there. So you make a bechamel sauce, which is like a white sauce without the cheese, one of the most important things. It's also got a bechamel sauce in there. There's so much in there. So you make a bechamel sauce, which is like a white sauce without the cheese, none of the good bits. And that's in there as well. So it's, I mean, there's a whisper of a fish flavor in there, I still believe. But not much. Now, Jenny, man, please. Oh! Actually, I don't mind turn that. So. And then you have to try this, because the difference with this is this took less than 10 minutes. That's hot smoke salmon. What do you think? That's not bad, actually. Oh, my God. I quite like the creaminess in it. Oh, really? There's plenty of creamy stuff in that. With crackers or something? Yeah, yeah. Maybe a bit of cheese. Okay. That's good. That's a good thing. This by contrast, hot smoke salmon, cream cheese, horse radish cream, and some dill and some lemon zest, so lots of punchy flavours. So you know the immediate comparison. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Oh, my God, you better say it's better. And how long does this one take compared to the other? Less than 10 minutes. Oh, right, stop it. Yeah. And what was your take on the salmon mousse? Oh, yeah. Oh, well, this one. Oh, what did I think of it? Well, when I tasted it, I mean, it was an interesting, so that's good, right? Yeah. It's an interesting kind of thing because you kind of have to readjust your palate slightly when you're making it because we're used to doing things with, you know, fresh seasonal produce, lots of punchy kind of flavors. And so for me, that was like looking for the flavor and like really subtle. I mean, still, you know, not offensive, but not giving you that kick that you can get from that. Yeah. Were you, your flavor bomb, your dishes are. Yeah, yeah. I feel like we need to address the elephant in the room or the elephant trunk. Yeah. Can we get a close up on this? I'm guessing if I get a little tap, it's just going to... It's not going to do much. No, that's... That's solid. Wow. Mm-hmm. I don't understand who came up with these ideas. So I'm going to... This is never done before, and I haven't tested it, so I have no idea what's going to happen now. It's actually firmer than what I expected. Anyway, so we'll just... I'm just going to slice and see what happens. This, it, so I have no idea what's going to happen now. It's actually firmer than what I expected. Anyway, so I'm just going to slice and see what happens. This, actually, before I slice it and it all kind of falls apart, this is a beef fillet that is poached in liquid, same kind of liquid, because the flavour profiles are the same throughout the book. But then you cook spinach, boil spinach, and then you mash spinach and cream cheese and fried bacon and onion and you make it into a smeary paste. Then you slice up the whole beef fillet, you squish it all back together with the cream cheese in between and then you set it in the meat aspec jelly. I could do all of that but the jelly. Yeah, I know. Well, we could scrape the jelly off. So, you know, excuse me for putting my hand in here. So I don't know where we're going to hit because my jelly was a bit darker because in the 70s you used to be able to nip down to the shops and pick up a bit of asperic. But I had to make a kind of meat jelly. So it's a jelly made out of stock at all? Yeah, so it's made out of meat stock. Oh, that's not attractive. Anyway. You turn it around so they can... I don't know why the spinach is all squished off to the side there. They were together. Anyway, Sarah, you've made a modern version of this, which obviously is... Yeah, well, I mean... A lot better. For me, when it comes to... I'm just going to try a bit of the jelly. Oh, are you? Yeah. Let us know, how are you going? Look at it. Oh, it just looks like the Let us know how you go. Look at it. Oh, it just looks like the gelatin in between. It's just fat, isn't it? No, it's made from all of the cartilage and the bones and things like that. You get it down your mouth. My own protein. Jamie Oliver would, I'd say a beautiful. You ain't got to laugh, Jay. You ain't got to laugh. Certainly. You ain't got to laugh. Certainly a good lubricant for whatever else is to follow. The throat is lined now with this fat. Apparently they used to sell it by saying if you just let it warm up in your mouth. It's like having a little bit broth. But anyway. Modern version. Yeah, modern version. I mean, if you've got a beautiful piece of beef like that, which is expensive and you don't want to... I mean, from my perspective, you don't want to muck around with it too much. So that is seed in the pan, put in a hot oven with lots of salt and pepper, and that is it. You just cook it for 20 minutes. The meat is beautiful, and then it's got a really punchy horse radish cream that goes with it. These two dishes, Sarah? Yeah. Is it in the book online? They're both on the webs. Not these. No, not these are. Your modernization. No, the salmon patte is in Dishfast and it's also available online. So Dishfast is our cookbook. It's not the magazine. So these aren't in the latest issue. It's in the cookbook, which is still available to buy online at Dish and also in bookshops. But both of them are on the website as well. Sarah, you are amazing. And thanks for being such a great sport in taking up the challenge. I was nervous. It was stressful. Well, the first question that Jemay asked you, you're never shy with words, but all I could hear you say was, true story. True story. Thank you so much, Sarah, as always.

Sam Kelway has been catching up with Otero's brightest sparks in the competitive world of VEX robotics. You know it, Sam. Kiota, how are you getting on, mate? Kiyota, Christoph, I knew you were on, mate. I would have actually put a suit and a tie on. But, you know, I'm always trying to impress... Standards. Look, I am here with some very smart kids, so I'm going to leave it to them because I'm not going to do any more talking because I'm going to look like a complete idiot. But, Dom, let's pretend you've got two minutes. The ding is gone. Yeah. Obviously, there's 15 seconds of programming at the start. Yeah. What are you trying to achieve here when you've got two minutes. The ding is gone. Obviously there's 15 seconds of programming at the start. What are you trying to achieve here when you've got a minute and 45 seconds? So generally in autumn will either get that one or have another robot latch to it. And then if no one has that other one, we'll also go attempt to grab that one. Oh, and fail. That's what happens on live TV. Keep going, great job. And then go from that and then grab two other goals. And then, oh, oh, try to part. Fantastic. So you've almost got three. How about you show us how it balances? So let's pretend you've got that other one. So you've got about 10 seconds to go. You'll try and get your robot onto the balance beam there, right? Yeah. It's worth quite a few more points on the balance as it is opposed with all the goals just sitting on the ground in your zone. It's worth like 20 more points rather than sitting up there than just in your home zone. Okay that was really good. During practicing Dom took about five or six attempts to get it up on the balance so you did live TV first attempt I love that. Noah the programming mate while these robots are in operation what's going on behind the scenes with a laptop and stuff? Yeah well like you said at the, we have autonomous for 15 seconds, and during that we use a lot of sensors and other things like that to make sure everything goes exactly how we want it. So we had an inertia sensor which tells us the rotation of the robot, and we use some custom code to make sure we can get the turns accurate every time. And then, obviously, all the controls need to work. So we've got all that. We have drive. We print the motor temperatures because sometimes the motors can get quite hot. So, yeah. Wow. Okay, we've got to go, but I want to see you guys in action. I'm going to race over here, guys, before we do go. This one picks up the morning donut. Have a look at this one go. Censes galore, guys. What's going on there? You've got 10 seconds to tell me. Okay, the rings come into this robot. They're channeled into the robot by two pieces of metal. Then we lift our goal up and then we've got a vertical conveyor about that picks the rings from our funnel at the bottom. And up the vertical conveyor. Wow, that is incredible, guys. Thank you so much for hosting us this morning. I want to see these robots in action. Thanks for having us breakfast. Good luck. Next month, you boys. Fantastic work. Thanks, Sam. A lot of talent in that room. You included, Sam. Love it. If they could just design something that would help me follow my washing, that would be excellent. But other than that, our future is so bright, so proud of those kids. Hey, thanks for joining us. It's been wonderful to have you with us in the program this morning. Kepa Tora. We'll see you tomorrow. Bye-bye."}
