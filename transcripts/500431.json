Every direction you look absolutely catastrophic. Yes. Yes. Yep, hello, Sergeant Bruce Martin speaking. Christchurch, yeah, I've heard. Yep. Yep, we'll be ready. We were put on standby 6 o'clock. We got a phone call saying get on the road. Hey, Patrick. Hello, are you coming with us too? We got back from being away and he's phone and said, keep you a gear packed, whichever. I tried straight away to get a hold of my parents and I've just got a dead phone line. This was the third big one we've been warned about. Is this the first lot of pictures that you've seen today? Yeah, it's the first opportunity I've even had to look at a TV. It's just unbelievable. I've only seen my wife for a couple of hours in the last two and a bit weeks. And now I'm off again for, I don't know how long. I don't know where my brother is. No one's heard from home. As I say, we're not going to be, I'm not going to be discussing with my guys. I've got them to think about. We've been told to expect no water, no power, no drainage, no sewage. From what I can see on the news, it's like we're going into a war zone. No part of the central city is spared. The urban city rescue teams, they don't know how many people they are looking for. Mass destruction, a site New Zealanders often see in other countries, but not here. We've got 200 police staff mobilised and are ready to get down to Christchurch as soon as possible. I'll be being flown by the Air Force and also coming in by road from other parts of the South Island. There are multiple deaths and injuries. Christchurch is a city destroyed. Civil defence has declared a level three emergency. We have reports that the airport is being evacuated. Defence forces have been called in to help along with emergency services from across the South Island. There's another one as well. We have to follow up that Rolls for the last free fuel point. Right on. We won't be able to get fuel actually in Christchurch. Oh shit, not right? Yeah. You're right? No. She's in the road. Yeah. Jesus, look at the word. You're just going to jump me at home? Yo, y'all, you're at home. Oh, y'all. Right, um, come on, mate. We'll be going, all right. Okay. See you soon? Did you take? Okay. Am I going to come in with with you and this one here? Yeah, yeah, jump in. Okay. We've been driving for about four or five hours now. Look at this. Where is all this traffic coming from? This time of night there should be nothing. We should see like two cars the whole way. We see horse floats. Trailers all piled high with people's gear on. There's got to be people just gaping out of the sea. Grab what you can and run. Yeah absolutely. Some of the trailers have just been piled up. From what I've seen today on the telly is utter chaos and destruction. These guys that live in this city, their homes are there, so they're going to want to get home and sort their own stuff out without being at work. So basically we're their first wave of relief, so we need to get there and get straight into it. Look at that. That is amazing. I can't even understand how that's amazing. I can't even understand how that's still standing. Shit, I hope that's nobody's bedroom. It's a bloody area, isn't I? Yeah. It's like being out the middle of the country, but with high rises all around you. Yeah. My God, that whole building, in front of that whole building's come off. It's like there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing. They come around the corner and there's an armoured personnel carry a park over the road. It's like, oh, okay. Shit. We're not going to hang around here too long. I don't fancy cabin. Look at the bits hanging off the top there. Yeah. My God. You can't hear a thing, can you? It's a bit desolate, isn't it? I reckon we stop. All 12. I'll turn the engine off, we'll just... You're getting out of here, I think. There is scary, isn't it? Um, where's the bus. All right, slept on a nice, warm, hard concrete floor. The biggest aftershock, I'm going to need to change my pants now. I thought the roof was going to come off the building. Let's go and see what Bruce is doing. Your O-Dak 100 hours wake-up call. Oh, thanks, mate. I'll make you a coffee, but I'd drunk it. Did you? I don't know. We'd like to see. Yeah. What is the time? Uh, right. Yeah. We're going to have to get moving in. We've got a briefing at, I think so, 700. Good morning, rescue efforts are continuing in Christchurch this morning to rescue people still trapped after the earthquake. This is as bad as it gets. Dozens of people here are yet to hear from their loved ones. At least 17 significant aftershocks have rattled the Christchurch area since 8 o'clock last night. Just get on to Papineau Road, and that'll take us all the way up to the shopping centre there. All right, so we're not going to be in town going through rubble or anything? No. Oh, okay. It's all right. Hey, we're here to do a job and that's our job today. All right. I've got DVI and other specialist groups in doing that sort of work. All right, so we'll hold the fort and they can do the real work. Well, it's not real work. I mean, at the end of the day, everyone's got their own task. Yeah. It's important. The last thing we want is building coming down on and having another fatality. You'd think coming into this, it'd be like a bomb's gone off and it's just a big epic centre of destruction but it's not, it's just little pockets. You know, that building's okay, that one's not, those ones are okay, that whole block's gone. It's just no pattern to it all, it's just completely random. I mean, that's real. I mean, that's real substantial damage. People lost their lives in this one which is, yeah. Coming under here and seeing Godley the founder of the city lying nose down in the dirt on the pavement, arm broken off, it's just almost impossible to describe it. The mother nature and anything man-made that was in its way was just absolutely shattered. If you look at behind you, we've got a whole building. One of the older buildings is just completely collapsed and caved in. You know, two top stories caved in on top of the bottom stories, so I was going to have to work the way through that too. Thanks mate. No sugar though. Do you something? Yeah. So, how many do you want to one or two? Yeah, fly out there. The PM is coming to do a visit. He is going to Latin Square so they've got a bus at media coming in. Originally they want to bring four buses in but they're allowed to bring one bus at media with 40 on board. Right, the rest of us grab ourselves coffee and jump in the cars and we'll go and relieve these nice shift guys. Oh you've got a radio going great radio. Sweet. This is worse than yesterday. There's a lot more smashed up shops and buildings. This is worse than yesterday. There's a lot more smashed up shops and buildings. It's a matter of eyes up everywhere you go. You're worried, you know. It's that all going to come down on top of us. In a wind, the only place to be around here is in the middle of the road. You can't stand under eaves of the building. This is not flash. It's not a flash at all. Everybody's got this spot. You turn up, have a look around, try and work out how high something is and how far it had come if it fell, and you're looking for your best spot. You get a decent shake and all the lamp post swobble, so you're looking for one of those to come down in scone you as well. That damage is quite incredible. I mean, the whole, so you're looking for one of those to come down and scone you as well. That damage is quite incredible. I mean, the whole front of the building is just absolutely peeled off. Yeah. Bloody hell. The thing I can't get over that you've got that much damage and you've still got things sitting up right on shelves that haven't even fallen over? Well it sort of gutch out and leaves you hollow. It is an unusual feeling to be in an area that's everywhere you look. All you see is damaged buildings, you know people have died as a result of injuries from those areas that you've been into. And the fact that there is, other than you, there's no one else actually in the area, which is just a really unusual sensation to be in when you know you're in a CBD. I'm going to go really loud if I see anything moved. Anyone else will change anything mood if you're going to get access to any of the floors because it completely and absolutely blocked. Just ahead on tonight, tough questions after a family's commissioner lands a two million dollar contract days after leaving his job. Our Christchurch's tallest building will be reduced to rubble and fears for Chappelle Corby. Shocking changes in her appearance. Do you want us for all that in tomorrow's weather at 1030?

Looking back when I first experienced depression, staying active was probably one of the best things I could have done. I didn't realize it at the time, but these days I know that if I don't work out at least three or four times a week, I just don't feel good. Now it's not the physical buzz that makes me feel good, it's the mental buzz. It's that little feeling of self-reward or goodness that comes from moving around that helps me feel better mentally. At depression.org.n.z, I'll take you through a program that will teach you that regular exercise is going to help you get through depression. Depression.org.com.com. I'll see you there. Sirc de Soleil invite you to discover a world of amazement. Saltembanko. Coming soon to Auckland, get your tickets today at Ticketmaster.

Welcome to the lunatic asylum. Gordon takes on a mother. You cannot see what's going on. I'm not saying. And her two feisty daughters. Okay. In a battle of the sexes. It was shambolic, sweetheart. Who will win? Are you capable of running this place? You don't have to be some group. Not again. Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. 7.30 Friday on one. Around 80% of the damaged central city buildings have been searched for signs of life. There have been no new rescues overnight. Even so the teams working through the carnage say that this still remains our rescue mission, not just an effort to recover bodies. Coming down Clumbo Street, working our way around debris, you know, streets that are I think you that would have made on them at the road seat for comp. Coming down Clumbo Street, working our way around debris, you know, streets that are covered more than halfway and fall and rubble and large pieces of masonry. We've come across two buses that have had masonry basically crushed through the roofs. I'm aware that people died in those buses, but see those two buses flattened but the way they were just pancake down. Yeah, just awful. Absolutely awful. Stop for a minute. Yeah. Car park building that's been constantated down with cars and crushed in between it. It's either the Los Angeles or Sanfran when they had the big overhead motorways collapsed on top of each other. And these cars are just sandwiched flat and I'd hate to think that anybody was actually in there when that collapsed down because there's no way you would survive. We're being in Low Colombo Street, which is known as the Sydenham area. It's between Moor House Avenue and Believ. So we've got cordon points all the way at this main street, extensively damaged on the shop fronts. And our task really is to make sure members of the public are kept out of this area just to prevent further injury or death. Hello? They don't deliver Port-Aleuze out here. So we do things that normally lock people up for on a Friday night. So don't tell anyone. But yeah, you go into the Mexican restaurant or something and see if the facilities are okay to use in there. And there's half-empty glasses of wine and pints of beer sitting on the table. All the buildings around are completely destroyed. But yet there's this delicate glass sitting there still standing up bright still with contents in it but then on the other side of the bar the entire stock is smashed on the floor Emergency specialists from around the world are answering a call for help help is here police and search and rescue teams arriving in Christchurch to beef up numbers. And they join the more than 700 search and rescue teams from six countries. They're quite incredible to watch the USA guys, they're taking everything in their stride. The base of Latimer Square, sleeping in tents. Talking to the, I think it was the New South Wales, you saw guys earlier on today, they've come fully self-supported for 70 days. That's everything, including all their food and water. They're exceptionally brave people. They're going into buildings that I wouldn't go into to look for survivors. Go around, just have a look around, but. Yeah, just have to watch them. Whoa, just massive after shop then. Is that an aftershock? That's right. I wasn't sure if that's an afterstop. It's really unstable to come again. I wanted to check first. Yeah, they had a little bit roughly. That's right. Yeah, there's a lot. Oh my goodness. Well done. It's all right. He's very much for that. He's been eating? It was only one, but he's. Oh, fantastic. I think there's a name in the bridge that says Duffy. You okay, bud? Found its food, so it wasn't hungry. I don't know. You're OK, bud? Found its food, so it wasn't hungry. Smart pussy cat. So how about if we give you your mother and father a phone call and they can come down and pick you up? We're going to put you on the booze bus in the shade so you don't overheat. Let's go. But I would say that's at least one of the nine lives gone. Cheers guys. But I would say that's at least one of the nine lives gone. Cheers, guys. So we've got this lovely old church here. We had an after shock come through just before. There's a couple of rubber necks standing right underneath this corner. As masonry is falling down. It's all right because the guy had a massive lens on his camera like this, and I'm sure he got a really good photo of that rock hurtling towards his head. So a couple of swift words from us, and he saw the air of his ways and moved on before his brain damage for good. How are you guys? Good. Are you here to have a look at that building, are you? Oh, yeah. I don't know what we can do. Is it going to be safe? How? Well, if you're not on a stake, probably not, no. No, we had one before, and there's bits and pieces falling off the corner here. What are those things called? They're called buttresses, aren't it? Buttresses, that's the one. My problem is, if that collapses now, do you see that wall? It's going to take out that other lane there. Yeah, that's what we kind of need to ascertain. I would move the cordon one lane out because that wall, you could see it's all moved, and someone said it's moved again with another big with a big shift we had one before and stuff was falling off that corner okay if you want a hand we'll do that now all right how far out you want to move it I think if we go one more lane right across yeah yeah just all right at the end of the day if it does come it's gonna go right yeah all right oh oh sorry that's right. I'll start moving them out. You haven't got any spare cones? All right. I know a long day today. I'm not a long day today. For the long day today, start time for the record 0730 for this time 2130. Was everyone happy today with the way things around? We got food and drink and what else we need? This was handed out at the briefing tonight. The main thing is there's 98 confirmed fatality so far. One of the main issues for us is going to be hygiene. They've had a case of gasto reported already. So basically, we've got hand sanitizer on the bus, so use it and take sensible precautions. God's sake, if you get it, don't start hanging around everybody because it's going to be a nightmare. We can't afford to have all the emergency services going down. So if you get it, you've got to isolate. Let us know you've got to isolate yourself. We know how to curry again then. Do it all again tonight? Before everyone takes off, I'm about to head into Leastin, roast dinner, hot shower. Our last parents are expecting more than just me out there for dinner tonight. So anyone else wants to come in. And they'll do your washing as well if you'll drop it off and they can drop it back in here tomorrow for you. Mike, can you make you have passed on anything? International specialist search and rescue teams are being deployed to sites where there are few resources such as suburban areas. We've just had in the last 15 minutes another big quake it was 4.4 and it just goes to show this is very much still a changing situation. Rain is forecast for today. Okay, do I need to come and see you before we take off or? Okay, see soon. We're going to red cliffs. Is that all of us or something? No. As far as I know anyway, no one's allowed to be in here at all. So no one, I don't care where they've got to get the budgey out or their family jewels. We'll send them all away. Oh my god, look at that. Hit me out to the right. That used to be covered in forest. Several streets have been evacuated in the seaside suburb of red cliffs after rockfall and landslides threatened homes. This morning the police are just holding the cord in here and everything is quite airy. You'll see there's cracks all the way through here and every time there's a aftershock to get bigger. You've got use in there. There's some deceased in the house at the end, working away at the end there. They're in there dealing with the digger guys. There's a lot of rest homes and elderly people living here. This whole area here has been evacuated. The only reason people allowed in and they're taken in one at a time is to get urgent medicine and that's it. I understand there's already some deceased down there that they're working on recovering now. And that's your grandmother, is it? Yeah, and we three live there. Oh, you're both of the grandpa? Yeah, we three there. So you've got nowhere to go home to at the moment either? Well, that's always there, friends, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll be here all day. Yeah. And if you want to know anything, ask me, and if I know anything, I'll tell you, okay? Your name, sir? Patrick. Patrick, thank you, Patrick. No worries. Thank you very much. We'll be back later, then. Hey, no worries, I'll be here. Hmm. I think they know what this probably get me. with that man. Thank you very much. We've just had these people to get their medication and I'm going to allow them just a couple seconds longer to grab some containers to put water because where they're going to they have no water supplies. Elderly people break in routine. Something major like this is very, very, very disturbing for them because it really throws them out of kilter. Okay, no, have you locked the door? Yeah, just like your house up, sir. Yeah, that's all right. Thank you very much. You're all welcome. All right, we've had some vehicles arrive up the road there. And I've just had confirmation via radio that a body has been recovered from the house. So we've got about 20 or so people up there now, just trying to dig her from under all the rocks and rubble and stuff. We need the DVI guys in there, we're not allowed to deal with the deceased at all. We can't touch them, can't move them. I mean really it's the search and rescue guys and the DVI are doing really hard work. We got really good evidence out of her handbag, which wasn't attached to her, which identified her dentist. Oh, magic. So if they come back, I say yes, someone has been recovered. Yes. And they will be contacted by the DVI team. They should. Should have reported her as missing. They have. Yep. So as part of that process, they will be contacted by part of the DVI team and go through that. She was found on the sofa. Yeah. Pinched up right, she was having a snooze on the couch. Yeah. Sleeping on the couch. Curled up on the sofa, you know, pinched up, right, she was having a snooze on the couch. Yeah, it's just, yeah. Filled up on the couch. Like, if there's any news that you saved, then you let them... Yeah, um, if we have recovered someone that has died. Now, it looks as though grandma was asleep on the couch. Your grandma is safe, if it is grandma. Thank you. Hey? Thank you. It's so hard for me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. It's so hard for me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sleeping in the couch peacefully, right? Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. The weird girl she just grabbed a hold of me and just hung on for dear life and she was kept thanking me. which seems a funny thing. But I suppose that she knew that she was going to get her grandma back at the end of the day. And hopefully that helped her come to terms with their grief and will help work through that grief. Yeah, beautiful. Coffee would be great, thanks. That'd be superb. You're a legend, mate. And, yeah, obviously you might have had a different day than me. Yeah, well, I'd know he wasn't quite saying. What happened out at Burnside? Oh, yeah, it wasn't real. We just sat and had food and I don't know what to expect. Yeah, I had lots of food today. Yeah, why is that not in you? Oh, no. It wasn't real. We just sat and had food and I don't know what to expect. I had lots of food today. Yeah. Why is that not? I'm not surprised. But I didn't know what to expect. Well, it was like a little village. And we had, it was almost not real because someone told us there was a biker in the mess hall. So we went in there to see. We thought, oh, hey, Dad, looking for A2, but we're going to see what gang they're from. And there's this big, big spud, shaved head, leathers, and we got around to see what gang he was from, and he's got a big cross on his back, and he's a religious biker going around, spreading the good word, making sure everyone's okay. And me and Fraser sat down having a sandwich with, we're this lovely Samoan family next to us, there's a Somalian lady, there's some, there's another POM. I sat with Fraser, he sat down with us, prayed for us, which was really, usually I think, oh, you're right, but it was superb, it was brilliant. And to top it all off, I was just thinking, this can't get any more strange, and Dave Dobbin turned up and played while I was having a sandwich. I had to pay 120 bucks to see him last year. So religious biker, beautiful families, all helping each other, Dave Dobbin playing the guitar. Nearly 80 hours since a destructive 6.3 quake hit. The death toll is 130. There are hundreds now working around the clock to stabilise this broken city. The latest information comes as a grim task of removing bodies from beneath the rubble continues in Christchurch and the chances of finding anyone alive are dimming as time passes. I'd say we're being retasked to Cathedral Square to relieve a nightship so let's just settle up and... Should we check the hard hat? Yeah, we'll check in the cars. There's loads in the car. The last minute we found out there's still some night shift guys working. We're going to go out near the cathedral and look after them for relief them rather. Hopefully we've got enough hard hats and hopefully they're not too tired yet after doing about 14 or 16 hours. Jeez. call me on my cell phone. If you need more staff there, we'll sort it out. So no one's in, no one's out. We started here this morning with this one. Yeah. And Paze, this was apparently six, six people, right? Yeah. Well then it changed later on in the morning, and a guy came back and said that he lived upstairs, he got knocked out, he's been in hospital, he's come back, he said, he said the girls work in that dress shop down there. Yeah. Six working the dress shop. But it's one o'clock in the business day. Of course they're working in the dress shop. Yeah. Whenever they're digging or looking, they're all very serious. So you see them all lined up either side of the diggers as the diggers are going through all the piles. If they see anything, bits of clothing or anything like that, they'll stop the digger and they'll go over and they'll have a ferret around. Holmes, I'll hear, go ahead. We want to see a 26-2 on it or whatever last night was. If there's any single door that's locked and you force it, you write forced on it, so that the whole lot then is totally clear. They are doing a really, really tough job. They are the real workers, I suppose. Them, the DVI team showed I'd tap my head off to them, you know. It was a real hard job, it's a real hard work. All right. A few hours past lunchtime and finally get to sit down and have a feed. And we're in what used to be the posh upper class High Street shopping area. And I've got to say, considering the setting and everything else, this is probably the most bizarre lunch I've gonna go. These guys have the dogs, you can have over the building. And they'll just under cape, hopefully if there's anyone in there or not. You've got broken glass, metal, all sorts of bits and pieces through there. So they put these little rubber booties on the dog's feet. They don't like it much. Once they get used to it, they're all right. This mark here on the ground, it's a V with narrow. It's his car. So there was somebody in a car there. There's a... Yeah. The dog's gone back to this car over here about three times, right? The one that's upside down. The Intel on this right? Yeah. The dog's gone back to this car over here about three times, right? The one that's upside down. The Intel on this, right? Yeah. Is it, whether it's accurate or not, is that there was a blade. He's with his daughter. He had some story about everyone being swept in. And he hasn't seen his daughter. Yeah. Daughter's still missing apparently, right? Like I saw an excavator here three days ago working, but there was no USA team with it. Yeah. So he can't seen his daughter. Yeah. Daughter's still missing apparently, right? Like I saw an excavator here three days ago working, but there was no USA team with it. Yeah. So he can't assume that this pile's clear. Oh, okay. And the dog keeps going back to the car. I'd say probably 60, 40. Yeah. 44. 60 against, but also your environment's a big factor in that. And the dog hasn't nailed in there and given me his best response, which is a down and a bark. We're not walking away from it. The dogs were indicating about a 60% chance of there being nobody there, 40% chance if they're being somebody there. Every time they're doing, I'm just sitting there hoping find nothing. I really want them to find nothing. You know, if they find nothing, it's a good day. If there is somebody in there, somebody wants them back. They need someone to bury, they need closure. So if there's somebody down there, I hope they find them. Two people have just been found under the rubble. One adult, one baby. So we've... Just waiting for the DBI guys now to take them away. Alright, you're on drinking water. Alright, you can't drink of water? Sorry, you can't get him like how many inches the high, was it? Yeah, all right, John. Oh, long day. Yeah, we weren't expecting that at all. The Aussie fire chief was a bit concerned about you and I suppose I am too and that's why I actually wanted you the hell out of there. We've got a job to do. That's not going to change anything but... No, like I know it's difficult to deal with but I suppose a little bit different in the fact with the infant yeah and a young mum together you knew there's something there's I don't know you get a feeling I suppose and yeah I was was not happy. Deaths are people, affect people in different ways. And I just want to make sure that you're actually okay. Because I thought that you were a lot quieter than normal. I'm not going to say, oh, yeah, hey, I'm great. Bruce, let's go to work tomorrow. I'm not, but I'll go to work tomorrow, you know. It's, yeah, hey, I'm great. Bruce, let's go to work tomorrow. I'm not, but I'll go to work tomorrow, you know. It's the ones that you least expect that will come up and you might have an emotional outburst, which is completely out of character and unexpected for you, and those are the sort of signs to look out for. Yeah. All right. Well, I can say I'm pleased I don't have kids because then I might not go to work tomorrow. Inspector Mike Cook has actually driven up at 3 o'clock this morning. He's picked this up from Mark's wife, his children, have put this care package together for Mark. I don't know what's in it because I haven't opened it. If there's true, none of you are ever aware of it. So, Mark, this is from your son and your two daughters because they've gone to a lot of trouble and it just shows that the family are there to support us while we're doing. You can spell a name right. Well, don't know. Do you want to get one in there? Phoebe? Jack. Mustachio's own on, mate. There are nothing else to say to there, mate. Put it back. Oh, nice one to pick. Hey, we're lucky though. All our kids and families are safe, so we're really nice. And these cops here in this town have got to do that job. Having said that, I mean, we all know people like my parents here, they've lost their home. They're fine. My sister's had damage to her home. My brother, I haven't even spoke to yet, but I understand he's safe, so I'm taking. He's okay and that the house is fine. Guys have got to continue the search, but because the building's so unstable, they can't go in by foot so they've got a crane in, and they've got to start from the top, start pulling everything out the way. Those guys in the top there, just sort of looking down on everything, see what they can see first. Now why do we have to be here? We'd rather have a day somewhere else. It's not easy to deal with it all, but you're there to do a job. You just got to do it. If you don't do the job, I was going to do it. This is what we're here to do, really, regardless of some of a job. You just got to do it. If you don't do the job, I was going to do it. This is what we're here to do, really, regardless of how horrible the job can be. That's what we do. It's a reality of it. Officials say Christchurch's CBD will be shut for months. The blunt statistics of the damage inside the four avenues is beginning to emerge. I'll see you shortly, all right? Yeah, cheers. Yeah, it's interesting. I thought this was going to be in the pipeline. Initially, when we came up, we've been told we were going to be here for 14 days. I've just found out that they're actually going to be pulling the pin tomorrow and we're actually going to be heading home. I'm really looking forward to getting home. I think I'll have Dave doing nothing. And I'll mow the lawns. But, I don't know, kind of feel a little bit ripped off about being sent home so early up. So we're being ready for two weeks. They're going to be disappointed. I'm disappointed. I mean, we're here to help. That's what we came up for. And almost feel like we're letting people down by not being here. We all said that we feel guilty, that we're here for a short space of time. That's the one thing we've all kept on to each other. We're going back to paradise. And they have to stay here and try and get on with it. And it's a bit hard to see how someone's going to get on with it when it's flattened. So I'm sure they're going to, but yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. The Prime Minister has announced two minutes of silence on Tuesday afternoon, exactly a week after the deadly quake hit. The"}
