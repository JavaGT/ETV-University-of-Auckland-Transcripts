The Murdox were feared and revered in equal measure, presiding over law and order in a small town in South Carolina for almost a century. But by 2019, the power and influence they have begins to unravel as the family is plagued by scandal. Tonight we bring you the story of a disgraced dynasty that gripped America. This was supposed to be just another normal night for six friends from the small town of Hampton, South Carolina. They were supposed to go out on the boat around the low country, have a few drinks, just a little fun. But this night was going to take up violence. I could tell he was drunk as he just as an only immigration man was drunk. Deadly turned. I saw the bridge coming and I was scream. Imagine there were six of you that you look around and somebody's missing. What happens on this night begins an unraveling of sorts that takes down a legal dynasty that had been powerful in these parts for more than a century. For 85 consecutive years, some member of the Murdoch family was the solicitor. So it's into this family of power and privilege that Paul Murdoch is born. His father, Alec, is a prominent lawyer, his mother Maggie, and his older brother who's known as Buster. That night, Paul Murdoch and five of his friends decided that they were going to do a date night. Paul Murdoch was there with his girlfriend, Morgan Dowdy. Anthony Cook was there with his girlfriend, Mallory Beach, and Anthony's first cousin, Connor Cook, was with his girlfriend, Miley Altman. Paul, who was 19 at the time, was borrowing his father, Elyke Murdoch's boat for the night. According to depositions, they went to Parkers, which is a local gas station. We can see the video that night where Paul is hauling the boat, and he parks at Parkers, and he goes in. When he goes in the store, he's not 21. He's not. He's 19. So do they check his ID? He had his brother's ID, and he hands it to the clerk. And as Paul's leaving Parker's, he actually lifts his hands displaying his new purchase to his friends. Look what we've got for our party on the boat. So all six of them congregate at about 6.30 to get in the boat. They leave and they go to the oyster roast for about five hours. And they kept going back to the boat to drink. They weren't drinking in front of everyone. So just after midnight, the group leaves the oyster roast and they go to downtown Beaufort to a place called Luther's. Some of the ladies wanted to go home. Paul, it was his boat. He was driving, and he wanted to go get a shot. There's video footage. We can see them walking on the dock. We could see in that video that they have a couple of shots. He stayed for about 10 minutes, and then they head back to their friends on the dock. Paul is, he's swaying. I mean, he stayed for about 10 minutes, and then they head back to their friends on the dock. Paul is, he's swaying. I mean, he clearly is intoxicated. You said you noticed that Paul was getting kind of drunk. I could tell he was drunk. He, like, he gets drunk a lot, and it's just kind of like he just is a whole other creation when he's drunk. According to depositions, Paul changed so much when he drank that his friends, when he started getting aggressive, they'd be like, oh, that's Timmy. Timmy is his alter ego when he gets drunk. Paul was just driving and doing donuts and we're not going anywhere. We're just like just doing circles and Morgan gets mad and like yells at him. It was like, listen, like you need to stop. Testimony was Mallory asked to be let off, but, you know, it comes a point where there's no place to get off. And he wouldn't stop and wouldn't let anybody else drive. According to depositions, Paul Murdoch even had an altercation with his girlfriend. He just started calling her like a bench and was like, you're such a whore and all this kind of stuff. He slapped Morgan and he spit on her and cursed her. No, I've never seen Paul do that. And I'm not saying he didn't do it that night. I don't know the answer to that, but I would be very surprised. I've never seen that happen before. Eventually Paul, he's like, y'all want to go home, we're going home. So he puts the throttle down planes the boat out and they go here where they turn into Archer's Creek now you can see in this picture that Archer's Creek is a narrow very winding waterway Mallory was in the back of the boat seated on a cooler that's immediately behind the console I saw the bridge coming and I was just in shock and then like behind the console. I saw the bridge coming, and I was just going to shock. And then, like, at the last second, I, like, scream. The boat hits the piling. It throws Anthony and Mallory into the water, and Mallory's nowhere to be found. Connor had his phone was still on him, so I was, like, calling out of one. Oh, my name. Please give someone. No, I'm going. We're going, okay. At first, nobody can pinpoint exactly. At first, nobody can pinpoint exactly which bridge and which river they're talking about. Is everybody there? Has anybody injured? Morgan's hand is injured. She's bleeding. Connor has a fracture in his jaw and a laceration where he hit the console during the impact. Paul is in the water, comes out of the water. He's only wearing his box shorts. Anthony apparently injures his shoulder. Then Mallory's missing. I got a call from my mom to ask me then Mallory's missing. I got a call from my mom to ask me if Mallory was home with me, and I told her no. And she just said that there had been a boat accident. So you just gotten in the car and headed in the direction of the crash. Yes. We've seen the dash cam video from the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office. There were a couple of cars on the scene, and their cameras were rolling. You don't really see a lot, but you hear a lot. He can still see Paul walking around. He can't. And what kind of a reaction does that? He screams at him. Get that my. Right there away from me. Oh, you're smiling like you're funny. Sit down, sit down. OK, right to. Sit down. And part of what Anthony was so upset about that night was this idea that Paul wasn't going to get in trouble. He has a conversation with this officer to that point. You all know the Lick Murdoch? That's his son. That's so driving both. Good luck. At least three members of law enforcement on the scene that night had a connection to the Murdox. There was one guy there who said he played in a golf tournament that was hosted by the Murdox. There was one guy there who said he had been invited to the house, and his wife worked at the law firm for a period of time. There was another officer there who the Murdoch law firm had gotten his mother a large settlement in a recent personal injury suit. There is an unusual amount of evidence that seems to be unaccounted for. Paul Murdoch's clothing, his pants, his cell phone, wallet, these are things not accounted for. Why wasn't that submitted to evidence? Because this is a crime scene, that's what you do in a case like this. Paul is still being aggressive. Paul is still acting like he is drunk. Paul was just like going on and on and on. He got into the guy's, the officer's face, and it was like, you think that you're like a bigger man than I am. And so you would think that that would be a signal to the first responders that they need to do a field sobriety test, but that isn't done. While the other kids have all now gone to the hospital, Anthony Cook is refusing to leave without his girlfriend. And Mallory's parents are now there as well, desperately hoping for any news on their daughter. I just kept praying that they would see her, like, on a sandbar somewhere that she just couldn't get to us, but she was safe. A DNR officer says he's trying to talk to Paul when in-walk his father and his grandfather. And they say, look, that's it. You're done. Was the Murdoch family trying to protect Paul, trying to steer the blame to somebody else, his father and his grandfather. And they say, look, that's it. You're done. Was the Murdoch family trying to protect Paul, trying to steer the blame to somebody else? Do you think anyone in your family interfered in any way with the investigation? What did Paul's uncle tell investigators and the media? Stick around for that story right after the break here on 2020. Tuesday, meet Greenfinger Francis. They all die.

Welcome back. For years, the Murdoch name has been synonymous with power and privilege. But the family social standing is on shaky ground after one of its younger members has a run-in with the law. That is until the family matriarch steps in to absolve Paul Murdoch of blame. That night at the hospital Paul is strapped to a gurney because they were afraid of him being violent. So they drew his blood. At 4 a.m., two hours after the crash, he was more than three times over the legal limit for driving. So there are investigators there at the hospital, and they're trying to figure out what happened. That's their job to do. Alex and Randolph Murdoch come in. It's not just a concerned parent and a concerned grandfather. You've got two attorneys walk in. Randolph was reported as saying, you're not talking to him anymore. You're talking to us. We're his attorneys, okay? We also know from court records that Alex went from room to room telling these young kids to be quiet. Don't talk. Connor Cook's testimony is particularly important. Alex stops him in the hallway to try to talk to him. Alec Murdoch says, you don't have to tell anyone who was driving. We're going to take care of this. You don't have to say anyone who was driving, we're going to take care of this, you don't have to say anything. And Connor doesn't. In a legal filing, Alec Murdoch has denied telling Connor Cook not to cooperate with law enforcement. Although there was no indication in the investigative file that Paul Murdoch was asked to perform a sobriety test, and keep in mind, his family owned the boat, and he was clearly very intoxicated that night, someone else was asked to. Connor Cook, but he refused. I think his parents began to develop that concern that somehow things were off kilter here. Their son was being wrongly focused on as the possible operator of the boat. I've never been involved in a fatality where the operator of a vehicle was under the influence that that person didn't go to jail immediately. Immediately. Immediately. You or I would have probably would have been wearing an orange jumpsuit before daylight. But after he's evaluated at the hospital that night, Paul Murdoch's allowed to go home with his family. Do you think anyone in your family interfered in any way with the investigation? No. None whatsoever. Do you think that their prominence in this area played a part in how this investigation was conducted? I think there's certainly a lot of connections to people that were involved have with the family. Why the investigation was not done in a more professional way is something we intend to find out. Whether that was a function of interference, whether it was a function of law enforcement relationship with the Murdoch family, deference to them, or something worse, I mean, is exactly what we're going to be exploring. And now we've learned that the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division has launched a criminal probe into whether Alec Murdoch obstructed justice in the boat crash investigation. And so that night, I'm worried about finding my child, and they're worried about how they're going to cover up Paul driving. The search for Mallory Beach went on a whole week. It was huge. The community really rallied. Did you go to the boat landing to that area every day? Every day. Every day. And you had DNR searching, Coast Guard searching, volunteers. Anybody with a boat. You know that the longer it's drawn out, the more likely that the results aren't going to be what you want them to be. I prayed every day, Lord. I wanted some closure. And we prayed for that closure for seven days. And on the eighth day, it was a Sunday. We went to church. We left church and decided to drive them after church towards the landing. And we seen these cars pull up and I looked at this one gentleman, did a shirt and it said corner on it. You saw a shirt and you knew. Oh yeah. 911, where's your emergency? We're on the search team rescue. We think we found her. Mallory's body is found a week later by two fishermen about five miles away from the crash site. There were hundreds of people at her funeral in Hampton County. Then, in the days and weeks to come, you began to see this wondering, is justice going to be so? There was talk of a whispered campaign to cover this thing up. Were you worried that there wasn't going to be a charge for what happened? Yes, I was worried about that. Just being from the family that he's from, it would be probably a cover-up. You thought that from the first day? I did. It did feel as though it was the beginning of quite a drama. Within weeks of the boat crash, Mallory Beach's mother files a civil lawsuit against the convenience store where the alcohol was purchased and against Paul Murdoch's father, Alec, and his older brother Buster. What was the reason for why you guys filed the civil suit? What motivated me was getting evidence of everything. I knew who we were up against and how things would probably disappear if we didn't act quickly. His brother is the one that gave him his ID to use, to buy alcohol illegally. His dad is the one that gave him his ID to use, to buy alcohol illegally. His dad is the one who never made him be accountable for his actions. They deny that Buster knowingly gave Paul his ID, and they deny even that Paul was driving the boat at the time of the crash. Do you feel like some of the perception of your family has been wrong? Yes. I see words like dynasty used in power. And I don't know exactly how people use those words, but we're just regular people. So you don't think your family has power? I don't view my family that way at all. You knew who they were. Do you feel like they're a powerful family? I do. What makes them seem powerful? Like above the law, like the law didn't pertain to them. I wanted accountability. I wanted Paul to just own up to, yes, I was driving the boat. It was an accident. I'm sorry. It took nearly two months, but Paul Murdoch was. Charged was three boating under the influence felony counts on April 18th, which was Mallory Beach's birthday. If convicted, he was facing up to 25 years in prison. What was your reaction to hearing that he had been charged finally? I was pleased that finally we were starting to move forward. When we found out that Paul was charged, I thought for sure he'll at least have to spend some time in jail. He'll have to wear the orange jumpsuit like everybody else in Beaufort County does. That's what happens. Instead of being arrested and taken to a jail, Paul Murdoch's attorneys were able to arrange for him to come to court and be arranged in book there. Paul Murdoch was released on his own recognizance, and for two years, this case just dragged on. Many people thinking he would never have a day in court. But then in June, something happened that stunned, not just South Carolina, but the whole country. People are thinking, wait, a little bit of badly. People are thinking, wait, another young person from this boat crash has tragically died. Are they breathing? No, ma'am. The young man who allegedly killed Mallory Beach has been shot and killed. This is backwood justice. Now this story becomes an international murder mystery. Yes, coming up, the dark secret that's threatening to tear this town apart.

The wheels of justice are turning, albeit slowly for the beach family as they seek justice for their daughter Mallory. The case against Paul Murdoch is slowly making its way through court when the unthinkable happens. The scene that Alec Murdoch is looking at is his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and his 22-year-old son, Paul. Is he moving now, your son? I know you said that she was shot, but what about your son? Nobody. They're not either one of these food. The mother and the son were found dead, not too far from each other, near a dog kennel. They were both shot to death outside their property. Did you hear anything, or did you come home and find them? I've been gone. I just came back. I couldn't believe it was true. I could see the white sheets. I still couldn't believe it could be them. There were first responders there. My focus was to go to my brother. He was standing at a distance, looking on, like in disbelief, crying. Could he tell you anything about what happened? He had a difficult time talking, and he would try to crying. Could he tell you anything about what happened? He had a difficult time talking, and he would try to talk, and he would break down. Alec and Maggie Murdoch also had an older son, Buster. Eleg tried to call him, and he got through to him, and he tried to tell him. But he broke down and couldn't. And so I got on the phone with him. They discovered these two bodies on their 1,700-acre property. The shell casings that are found later will show that they were shot by two different firearms. Why were they shot with these two different guns? Were there two shooters? The coroner tells us that the killings happened sometime between 9 and 9.30 p.m. Your brother was at your mom's house the night of the shootings. He had gone to visit my mom. My dad was in hospital. She has dementia, and he was just going to check on her. In a double homicide, I think it's pretty clear that you look in the family first. There's no possible way he could have anything to do with this. I can assure you. This morning, a grieving family looking for answers. The family releasing a statement saying they are devastated by the deaths. Law enforcement put out a statement the next day that said, at this time, there is no danger to the public. One of the more common comments that I heard on the street was, this must have something to do with that boat crash. The beach has never wanted anything like this to happen. They didn't. So we volunteered to give DNA and statements so they could be excluded, which they were. You hear all this talk on the social media with regard to Paul. I've heard that Paul had gotten some threats. I knew generally about them, yes. But as reporters are digging into everything associated with the Murdoch family, they discover that Mallory Beach's death isn't the only untimely death that seems to be connected to this family. They learn about a young man named Stephen Smith was found dead in the middle of the road. They begin interviewing people who may have known Stephen. The name Murdoch pops up numerous times. It's like, what's going on here? While no suspects have been publicly named in the double murders of Maggie and Paul Murdoch, the investigation is raising more questions about this prominent family. You see, just two weeks after the homicides, another case from 2015 resurfaces. Around 4 a.m. on July 8th, 2015, a man named Ronnie Kavers called 911 and said that he saw a man in the road in Hampton County, South Carolina. So my boy, he didn't move. All right, we'll get it off the head out that we. Stephen is a seven-inch gash on the right side of his forehead and his head is caved in, right? It looks like from force of some kind. Toxicology reports don't indicate he was under the influence of anything. His car was a couple miles away, and it was out of gas, and the cap was hanging out. There's no tire marks. There's no pieces of car. No debris. Just a 19-year-old kid dead in the middle of the road. Stephen Smith was 19 years old. And he was openly gay in this very small town, which could not have been easy. How did this 19-year-old end up dead just a few miles from home in the middle of the night? First responders get to the scene, and they first think that it is a gunshot wound, and they thought it was a homicide, and they start throwing around the possibility of maybe this was a hit and run. When there's a hit and run, often there is evidence, a broken mirror, a scrape of paint, shards of glass or plastic. Maybe there's skid marks. There's nothing. But then the pathologist who performed Stephen's autopsy determines it is a hit and run, surprising the investigators. The Highway Patrol just didn't, they didn't buy it, that this was a hit and run. He had no abrasions, no torn clothes, his shoes were still on his feet, cell phone still in his pocket. When somebody's hit by a car, the force of it usually pops shoes off and shoes go flying. Stephen's shoes are still on his feet. The theory was that Stephen's shoes are still on his feet. The theory was that Stephen was walking home after he ran out of gas and a mirror of a semi-truck hit him in the face. A mother knows her child, and no, my son would not do that. He would not be walking in the road he had his cell phone he was six miles from the house he would have called somebody have you heard any rumors or anything like that the rumors just going around camps and that everybody keeps coming up to me and saying it was murdoch boys the murdockdoch boys? Yes, whoever they are. Some pretty explosive allegations there. Can police find proof to back up these shocking claims? Find out after the break. After losing her love...

The further backward you look, the further forward you can see. Elizabeth, the unseen queen, Saturday on one. Welcome back. The Murdoch legacy looms large over the small town of Hampton and not in a good way. There have been killings, corruption, even a botched suicide plot. But for all the headlines the family generates, there are other lesser-known crimes that haven't been subjected to the same scrutiny. There's controversy around Stephen Smith's death. There are some who say this was a hit and run. Others say this was an intentional homicide. They begin interviewing people who may have known Stephen, and the name Murdoch starts popping up. No lawyers have contacted you about anything. Well, the day that Stephen passed away, Randy Murdoch was the second person to call my dad after the coroner. And he said he wanted to take the case and it would be free of charge and everything. And my dad's a little iffy on that. Why is this guy calling out of the blue and we just found out our son died? This is just a weird thing. The most persistent rumor told to police alleged that Paul's older brother, Buster Murdoch, was involved. Stephen Smith was a classmate of Buster Murdoch, and they went to Wade Hampton High School together. So the police are checking it out, but they can't get to the root of where this rumor came from. They can't really make any headway with it. The Highway Patrol tried to contact Buster Murdoch one time according to the file, but it said didn't answer. The family denied any connection to Stephen's death when I sat down with them in June. I know who Stephen Smith was, and I know his family. I know of no connection whatsoever of Buster or Paul or my family to Stephen Smith's death. The glare of the investigation into Maggie and Paul's double murders is raising more questions than ever about a different untimely death. Gloria Satterfield, who worked for the Murdoch's four years, had died after a trip and fall accident, and Alec Murdoch's insurance company had agreed to pay $505,000 for her wrongful death. When Gloria started working for them, she took pride in that and honor in that, and she treated them like her family. My sources have said, Paul looks at her like a mother. What we think we know about Gloria's death is that she was in the home of Alec Murdoch, that Alex dogs had jumped up on her, causing her to fall downstairs. My housekeeper has fallen and her head is bleeding. I cannot get her up. She felt going up the steps, up the brick steps. She cracked their head and there's blood on the concrete. She lives for three weeks. She never regains full consciousness. She laid in the bed, and I took her hand and asked her a bomb what happened and she couldn't tell me nothing. According to the family, at her funeral, Alex Murdoch says, it's my fault that she died at our house. She tripped over our dog and so I'm going to get you a lawyer. He can represent you, and he can bring a lawsuit against me. I will agree to it, and you will get money for it. We ain't had no reason not dreads them. We've known them all our lives. The Satterfield boys say, Elyke Murdoch looked him in the eye and said, trust me, I got you guys. You're going to get a lot of money and I'm going to handle everything But incredibly one of the most shocking pieces of this story was still to come Alec Murdoch was shot in the head and wounded on a rural country road yesterday Alec Marnock shot I mean his wife and son have just been killed. And now he's been shot? On September 4th, 2021, a 911 call comes in from Alec Murdoch. I got a flat tire. And I stopped and somebody stopped to help me. And when I turn my back, they tried to shoot me. A murder mystery in South Carolina taking a bizarre turn. Alec Murdoch was shot in the head and wounded on a rural country road yesterday. It's almost too much to believe. Is somebody trying to finish the job by killing another member of the Murdoch family? When Sled sends out their first press release about what happened, they make it abundantly clear that this is a superficial head wound to the head. Immediately doubt is cast on what happened. Who's lying here? Two days later on Labor Day, Alex PR team released a statement. He's resigning from his law firm and that he's checking into rehab. I have made a lot of decisions that I truly regret. I'm resigning from my law firm and entering rehab after a long battle that has been exacerbated by these murders. Alec Murdoch is, he says, addicted to opioids. If that's not someone saying I've committed crimes, I don't know what is. It's wild. As everybody's trying to process what that means, another statement comes out from Alec Murdoch's law firm. Over night, a new bombshell. ABC News has learned, Alec Murdoch resigned from his family's law firm amid accusations of misappropriating funds just the day before he says someone shot him. They alleged he'd been doing that on an ongoing basis for years. His brother Randy Murdoch issued a statement saying, while I support him in his recovery, I do not support, condone, or excuse his conduct in stealing by manipulating his most trusted relationships. And it kind of just keeps snowballing from there. He loses his law license. He loses his privileges to be an assistant solicitor. I mean, his life is falling apart. Clearly the story that they said initially about the shooting cannot be the full story. And breaking overnight. A suspect is now in custody in connection with the mysterious shooting of Alex Murdoch. A South Carolina man is behind bars for shooting prominent low country lawyer, Ale Alex Murdoch. A South Carolina man is behind bars for shooting prominent low-country lawyer, Alec Murdoch. Curtis Eddie Smith, who was a distant relative and a former client of Alex Murdoch, is charged with assault and battery of a high-agravated nature, pointing in presenting a firearm, insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and assisted suicide. Assistant suicide would mean that Ehrlich is trying to commit suicide, which is shocking. Murdoch admitted to investigators the plan was for Mr. Smith to murder him, leaving his son Buster to collect a life insurance policy valued at approximately $10 million. Ehrlich Murdoch was charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false police report, which are all felonies. All right. He's handcuffed. He's wearing shackles. He's wearing a Hampton County jumpsuit. The idea of Alec Murdoch once being such a powerful figure in this area, a member of such a legal powerhouse family quickly shatters. This morning, another twist. Authorities announcing Wednesday, they have opened a criminal investigation into the 2018 death of his longtime housekeeper and nanny, Gloria Satterfield, as well as the handling of her estate. Remember that wrongful death suit for Gloria Satterfield? Her sons say they never got a dime. Alex Murdoch took that money. But those alleged financial crimes may be the least of his worries. People are starting to wonder whether a man who says he hired someone to kill himself could be involved in the death of his wife and son. Alex sends the rumor mill into overdrive. Can he account for what he was up to that night? We saw a whole new woman. Meet the team behind the incredible transformations. The hair and the teeth and the Botox. Oh my God.

Alec Murdoch has swapped a suit and tie for a jail jumpsuit as he faces off with prosecutors in court. He's fighting charges he funneled money from his clients into a fake bank account to feed a booming black market. Your honor, he has fallen from great. Alec Murdoch's attorney, Dick Harpoolian, gets up and he he basically says, this is the face of opioid addiction. It was certainly a bombshell to drop that in court that all of this was brought on from opioid addiction. Also appearing in court on multiple charges, including assisted suicide. Murdox alleged accomplice, former client Curtis Edward Smith. Curtis says, ho do do, do do. He called me up. He told me to come and bring the truck. He said that he showed up and Ehrlich had a gun. And he had to wrestle him for the gun and the gun went off. That's his story. That's totally untrue, according to Alec. He met with Smith on the side of the road, gave him the guns, said, I'm going to look like I broke down, drive by and shoot me, which is exactly what Smith did. Smith was his longtime drug dealer, according to Alex. In addition to the shooting charges, he was also arrested on two drug charges. The scrutiny on Alec Murdoch now is out an all-time high. He's facing lawsuits from the boat crash. He's facing lawsuits from his own law firm. In the midst of all this craziness, a lawsuit drops from Gloria Satterfield's sons that says her sons never got any of the settlement money. At that point, we knew that the boys hadn't had got no money. So I said, well, you know, where did this money at? So I said, well, where did this money at? According to the lawsuit, Alec introduced Tony Satterfield to his best friend from college, who was also a lawyer, Corey Fleming, who sued Alec for Gloria's wrongful death under his homeowner's insurance. But Alec had allegedly convinced Tony to resign as the personal representative in favor of a banker that Alec knew Chad Westendorf. The day after Chad Westendorf took over his personal representative, settlement papers were filed. But the Satterfield family claims they never knew any of this. It took them some time to develop the courage, to go to a lawyer. They're scared. They're rightfully scared. They're small players who are forced to ask important questions about important people. We know how to get the answer. You write a letter saying, we sure there's a misunderstanding. Just send us the evidence of the settlement agreement, the court order, and the checks. When you send a letter like that, lawyers like us, we expect a response. But we got nothing. The only way to get answers is a file a that, lawyers like us, we expect a response. But we got nothing. The only way to get answers is to file a lawsuit, which we did immediately. Alex Murdoch is now accused of taking millions on a wrongful death settlement. According to court documents, Murdoch allegedly worked with two of his friends, an attorney and a banker, to pocket money, which should have gone to the family of his former housekeeper Gloria Satterfield. Information starts coming in and developing very quickly. It's not even the $500,000. That was just the first insurance company's settlement. According to the lawsuit, there was a second settlement that was not properly recorded. As you can see here, it was never given a docket number, and the case name was actually changed to in Ray Gloria Satterfield, meaning it was never connected to Alec Murdoch in court filings or anywhere else. It is 100% in the dark, unfiled, off book, off record. It turns out to be $ million three hundred some thousand dollars two point seven million dollars should have been paid directly to brian harriet and tony satterfield but they say they never got a dime nowlex murdock took that money according to the lawsuit he'd opened a bank account under the name Forge. And that's the same name as a respected holding company, Forge Consulting, that often distributes settlements just like this one. And the Satterfield attorneys say that it seems to have been chosen on purpose so that the money could be diverted into an account that's controlled by Alec Murdoch. The betrayal of trust is stunning. This deception, it runs deep, and it hurts because we did think of him as family. And we know Gloria did. Did he do this to more people? What is he really capable of? And where is all this money going? This is an ongoing investigation, Your Honor. This is the tip of the iceberg. At this point, Alec Murdoch is charged in two different cases. One for orchestrating his own killing and one for diverting funds away from Gloria Satterfield's wrongful death lawsuit. He writes a check for $610 grand to himself. He writes a check for $125 grand to himself. He writes a check for 125 grand to himself. Not a dime goes to this family back here.
