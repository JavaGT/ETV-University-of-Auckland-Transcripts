In the end, what's needed is a health system that is there and available like that. higher incidence of lung cancer certainly than non-Mari and for that not to be diagnosed as early for what can be a fatal condition that is a real tragedy. We're really focused on eliminating inequities, differences and outcomes for Mari and other New Zealanders.
