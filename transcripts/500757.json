See you tomorrow."}], "text": " now on the project, Mr Paddy Gower, you've been investigating the latest crime wave to sweep the country. Yes, I certainly have Mr Tom McCrae. We all know that there is a crime wave out there, but this is a crime wave within a crime wave. Jewelry robberies. We are talking millions of dollars going missing here. Nighttime, ram raids, daylight robberies and gang syndicates smashing shops with hammers and axes. A Jewel jewelry heist. The glamorous Hollywood movie plot. Here in New Zealand, there is nothing glam about it. It is just grim. It is very, very scary. It is very distressing. I'm constantly scared, constantly worried. It's so rampant. It's happening so often. This is Jay. His shop has been burgled four times in the past two years. They have hammers or axes or something really, and they break the front glass. Come right in. One guy is breaking all the cabinets. It's heartbreaking. Because you have worked so hard to get where you are in life and somebody comes and destroys it within seconds. Matesh has been robbed twice in three months. Thieves burst into his store while they were serving customers. Straight away, the heart rate goes up. We started just shivering. I just couldn't do anything. I was just totally, totally shocked to see the way everything happened. We put everything away at night but now they're starting to come doing the normal working hours. What's your biggest fear? Tomorrow they might just come and put a knife through us. What are we supposed to do then? Harish has had three aggravated robberies at his shop in broad daylight. With customers in the store, and these guys are daredevils, they would come with X and hammers, and then they smash my entire shop in front of our eyes, and we are helpless. We stand there, and we can't do a thing. And how often is this happening to other jewelists? Well, to be honest, every morning I wake up and I'm thinking, I wonder which store got done. Every other day, there is another headline, another shop done over. The big chains are a magnet for thieves too. Michael Hill's stalls have been robbed and ramrated at least ten times. Pascoes have also been hit several times, twice in one week. Most of the thieves have one thing in common. They are just kids. 12, 13, 14 year olds. It is these young fellows who are sent out to do the damage, to rob places, and this is their initiation. Some robberies are random, but others are targeting this. to rob places and this is their initiation. Some robberies are random but others are targeting this, gold, that their gang bosses melt down and turn into nuggets. In one minute and 38 seconds they cleaned us out to the tune of about $600 to $700,000 which translates to about five or six kilos of gold. What can be done to stop this? What do you think should be done to stop this? Well I think the. What can be done to stop this? What do you think should be done to stop this? Well, I think the police need to be given more powers. These kids are fearless. They are challenging the police all the time. We feel there's no consequences for people who do these sort of crimes. They are able to walk away very, very easily. Look, I'm totally disgusted with this, but in the back of my mind there's a human side of me which thinks and talks and says there is a better way of bringing these people up, whoever they may be, 17 years, 16 years. This is not life, you know. This is not what you do in life. Something needs to change, but until it does, there will be many more sleepless nights and restless days for these guys. I am still traumatized. I'm constantly thinking it could happen in the next five minutes. It could happen in the next minute. All right, this is the project. Mark Richardson, Justin Smith, and Amanda Gillies are here. Hey, can I just say that was a fantastic story, a really interesting insight. I think we all agree it's bloody wrong and unfair because not only is the financial toll huge, from what we can see so too, is the emotional and the sort of mental toll it's taking on these owners. Yeah and there was a whole lot of other jewelers that just don't want to come on camera because they're too traumatised and I can tell you this, the people that you saw there and the others that I've been talking to have been running businesses in Auckland for 20, 30, 40 years. They know what is happening on the streets and when they say that the crime wave out there is worse than ever before, we have to believe them. They feel unheard, unhelped, and they are very scared. They're at their wits' ends. How long before they got all these other suggested ways of security, how long before they shoot one of these kids? And these are kids at an age where the society, New Zealand, should not turn their backs on them. They can be safe. They can grow up and be meaningful members of our society. They get shot because these are scared shop owners. At the end of their wits, no one wins. Also tonight, one of our biggest country music stars joins forces with an icon Willie Nelson. We'll ask Tammy how it all came together. That's next. And for many of us, one glass of wine and we're hurting. It's not really a hangover, so what's going on? That's just a head. Okay, guys, it's the 20th of April, so happy 420 in New Zealand. Whoa. I don't know what that means. I don't know. I do. I do. I'm not sure. But Mark told me it's some kind of holiday that we should be celebrated. So let's go up and smoke with the Daily Dose. Now, first of all, we all love cute cats and cute kids. So here's a video that combines both, but with a bit of a twist. Here we're at the park. And it's just a young boy playing with his cat. How adorable. There they are, frolicking on the glass. The cat wants a play. But the last second he comes down and, oh, hang on, wait for it. Ooh. Bam. Takes him down there for no reason at all. I mean, enjoy it while at last cat because that baby will be a toddler soon. Toddler soon. We all know they basically eat cats. Next up, when you're getting married, you want your entrance to be, to the reception, to be memorable. But just make sure it's memorable for the right reasons. Now, there's always that one bridesmaid. Here she is with the best man playing Leak Frog. Oh, that goes well. She's a... Oh! I tried to pay Leap Frog in a dress once, and I'm pretty sure he's still under there, actually. We'll get him out later. We'll get him out later. It's finally. It's finally been met. Finally tonight. Finally tonight. I'll get my coat. Finally tonight, I have to say, I'm not the biggest sports fan. Sorry, Mark. But I have found a sports video that I really like because a lot of the players are getting really hurt. Now, here comes a football team running out to the pitch. Oh and a few of them are smacking their heads and oh no they've sorted it out now no they're fine. Here they come and they're going to... Oh! Bro! Bro! Bro! Out! I mean That looks sore but you think that was bad. The next team to come out was the basketball team. And that, my friends Who's your daddy did. I'm surprised that he didn't actually fall on the ground rather than agony holding on to his shin. Well, if anyone talking about screaming in pain on a sports pitch market, it would be you. But onto someone much cooler than Mark Richardson, Tammy Nielsen has long been Kiwi country music royalty, and I love her. Yeah, I love her too. Now the Canadian is taking up a notch, teaming up with the one, the only Willie Nelson. With four studio albums and numerous awards, Tammy Nelson crafts deeply personal songs, but her latest one is different. I close my eyes and I tried to go back to my slumber. Beyond the Stars was lovingly penned after her father passed away, capturing her grief, loss and desire to be with him again. She wrote it as a type of duet, and who better to be the voice of her father than iconic country music legend, Willie Nelson. Please welcome. The perfect addition to her upcoming fifth album, Kingmaker. Please welcome the one the only gorgeous Tammy Nelson. Now, the question on oil lips, Tammy, is what was Willie like? Oh, my goodness. He was so lovely, so warm and generous and surprisingly small. You know, like you kind of expect him to be a giant because he's a giant in your mind. Yeah. He was like this compact, beautiful man. He's a legend. I love it though. Yeah. I mean, working with a legend though, like, it's bad enough me with Patty. And I don't have to sing. Why are people laughing? I'm sorry. How do you control your nerves, you know? Oh, that, you know, I was saying to my brother, thank God we actually got to meet him the day before. So they asked us to come over to the house to do like a rehearsal, which that alone, I was like losing it. And I said to my brother, you know, when you have all these dreams and when you're a kid, you don't think of the physical. You don't think of how your body's going to react. And we were both just shaking. And we walked into his living room and met him and had a little rehearsal. And, you know, he had like his guitars in there and the amp wasn't working properly. And I'm like, he's just a musician. Like at the end't working properly and I'm like he's just a musician like at the end of the day I mean he's not any musician but there was something very relatable his son was there I grew up in a family band so it suddenly felt really comfortable and how did it all kind of come together because it's an amazing combination yeah it's kind of crazy I was supposed to perform at luck reunion which is a festival that's held every year on his ranch. And that was in 2020 in March, and we all know what happened. We don't have to talk about that. And so the festival got moved online. And I performed my three song set, beaming in from New Zealand. And unbeknownst to me, Willie and his wife Annie and their family were watching. And so they, this sounds crazy, but they became fans. And I had this influx of new followers on social media, and one of the followers was this woman named Annie, and she was so cool. And for about three months, we, like, chatted back and forth. And I did not realize until my brother said to me one day, you realize who Annie is? And I'm like, no. And he said, it's Willie's wife. Wow. Yeah. So it was really cool that we kind of built this friendship without me knowing who she was. And, yeah, it kind of ruled on from there. So we've had this friendship kind of over the course of the pandemic. And has really been a wonderful highlight of, you know, a silver lining, I should say, of this pandemic. And the song is about your father, who was a musician himself and a fan of Willie Nelson. I mean, what do you think your dad would actually think of Willie, really being his voice, I guess? Yeah, like, it's a song that I wrote with another New Zealand artist, Delaney Davidson, about both of our dads who we both lost. And, you know, having him sing it, the day that he sent his tracks through, I cried for three days straight. It just, it was so overwhelming. I mean, hearing this iconic voice singing with mine and singing words I'd written, but also just the thought of my dad's reaction to this happening. And it's still, I still, you know, I've heard it a million times and it still makes me weak when I think about it. It's an incredible track, Tammy. Now, Tammy's track Beyond the Stars is available now, and keep an eye out for her new album, Kingmaker. It is incredible. It's out on July 15th. You'll be able to find all the info about her tour on her website. So if you could, please thank the gorgeous Tammy Nelson. Okay, now a Kiwi company will grant employees period leave.

Stream every episode only on three now. Welcome back to the project. Now, a New Zealand company is giving a new kind of leave to some of their employees, period leave. Now, we're wondering if all companies should follow in their footstep. Last year, Radio announcer Lucia Patalo battled for her workmates to get period leave. She won. The policy means union members get 12 extra days of leave a year for period or menopause symptoms. Lucille's company is one of the first to do this in Aaltheidore, but overseas period leave isn't exactly new. South Korea has had period leave since 1953 and Japan's had it even longer. Most people you talk to here are into it. Yeah, I think it's good. I think that anything that we can do to support females in the workplace. I think it's a very positive thing the business is to be doing. I do agree as long as the benefits are not misused. I think it's great to have a choice on whether they can go to work or to stay home. When we asked on Facebook, though, the reaction wasn't all as positive, like Neff who said, and they wonder why employers won't hire women. Yikes. But here's the thing. Some people have periods that are no big deal. Others have periods that are very much a big deal. There's premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which causes depression and anxiety, and affects 5% of women. Then there's endometriosis, which can cause debilitating pain that affects 10% of us. And sometimes when you're bleeding all day, for days on end, you just need a day off word. Lucille Pettelor from Pacific Media Network is here with us now. So, Lucia, you actually got a no originally. How on earth did you change your boss's minds? I think with determination I changed his mind. Really just question the fact that if we are a media company and we share the amazingness of our Pacific people around the world who are making change, why can't we be part of making that change within our four walls and be able to do something ourselves as well and, man, this is a huge one. I love that. So has it changed the dynamics within your office? It has changed, like, a lot. The conversation with our male colleagues has actually been amazing. Like, they're asking, they're curious. And the best thing that I love is that it's a safe space, because that's what's very important is that these discussions are being normalized and they're happening in a safe space. And, you know, male work crew, they're totally supportive of the day off as well? They're not jealous? No, they're not jealous. They're actually supportive. And they're supportive because, you know, they themselves, they have women in their own lives that experience menopause or menstrual. And I just have to give a shout out to our men and our Etu Union Collective here at PN because they were supportive from the get-go when this claim came about. So have you started something here? Are you expecting this to become government policy any time soon? Oh, that's a tough one. I feel like I'm not in the position to answer yes or no to that, but all I can say is that I hope the influence I hope the influence is a good one and that I see more work spaces have this. Oh God see now I feel emotional talking about it because one thing for sure is I know that when I started this journey it started as me standing up for our collective, our people in our collective. Then it went to standing up for the women here in our Pacific Media Network office. And then I realized along the journey that this is a fight that I'm standing on behalf of just women in general and making change. And so, yes, I do hope that the change happens here in Aoteiro. Whether or not it becomes a government policy, I don't know. I'm not very good at politics but all I know is that I would like to see this change happen across the board, not only just in Altaero, but obviously like, you know, all around the world. Lucia, thank you so much. You are incredible. Thank you guys. Love your guys' work and good night, everybody. Look, here is a sharp reality check. One of my girlfriends gets really bad period pain. When she was younger, she used to have to leave the bathroom door unlocked because sometimes she would faint from the pain on the toilet so it allowed her father to come in and carry her up. That's how much pain they're going to. And if people are really struggling with this, they're not exactly many productive at work, are they? Oh, I think you find women with their period to be productive, just a little bit angry and productive. Take as much time off as you want. She'll see you, all right? I will. Thank you, I will. Well, most of us love cracking open a bottle of wine and enjoying a glass, but what if that one glass left your feeling like you drank the whole bottle? Kiwis love a little glass of wine. From a crisp Mahbrasav to a silky central Otago Pinot. In fact, Aoteuroa is known for its vibrant vinos. Graham Norton loves them. To me this is perfect. This is exactly what we want. And Sam Neal makes them. We find it's a vibrant, deep, ruby, red colour, like the Maharaj's jewels. But for some of us, even just one glass of plonk can bring on a hangover. Why is that? New research from a Kiwi wine maker suggests there's something in the brew that could be causing headaches or nausea in some people. Sophie Parker Thompson spent 18 months looking into what she's dubbed the undeserved hangover. Joining us now is Master of Wine, Sophie Parker Thompson. Sophie, so if it's not overindulgence, what is causing this reaction to wine? It's a very good question. There are a group of chemical compounds called biogenic amines, and there are numerous types of biogenic amines the most commonly known that we probably have all heard of before is histamine and if we have too many of them they can cause things like headaches hot flushes red rashes heart palpitations hyper and hypertension a really full suite of different symptoms so yeah there are a lot of people who do are sensitive to this well i just would have called these people lightweights. I would have said you lightweights, and then I would have teased them mercilessly. But have I had this wrong the whole time. Yes, you have, Mark. I think we should never tease anybody. It's a genuine issue, yeah. So this has got nothing to do with alcohol and someone just not been able to handle their booze. What our body normally does is that it breaks down the biogenicaneans entering our system through an enzyme that is found in our gut. But ethanol or alcohol actually inhibits that enzyme from working properly. So this is why their effects are enhanced, if you like, in wine and beer. Lots of people have always thought that it was the sulfites in the wine, which is a preservative use, that caused this. Is that just a myth? Yeah, there's a lot of misinformation out there about sulfites. But for some people, sulfites are a real issue. But typically all the medical research shows that sulfite sensitivity exists in only a small percentage of the acute asthmatics of the world. So these are people who have to carry around an inhaler with them at all times. Is it possible to make wine without histamines? Yes, yes it is. It is entirely possible. And a big part of that is actually using SO2 during the winemaking process. But I'm not talking, the research showed it's not a huge amount of SO2 that needs to be used. It's actually a really small amount. And if you add that at the very beginning of the fermentation stage, when the wine is still juice, that is enough to sort of knock out all the bad bacteria that are potentially making those biogenicamacemings later on in the piece. So, yeah, entirely possible. All this chat on wine has really made me hankering for a peanut grease. Sophie, thank you so much for joining us tonight and having a chat. Thanks for having you. I love this so much because for my entire life, I've thought I was a dirty cheap drunk when in fact I now have a legit medical reason. No, no, hold on. Nowhere in that interview does she say that some people don't get drunk on one glass. She just said sometimes one glass can make people sick. So you're still calling me a dirty cheap drunk? Yeah, you may have that. Thank you, Mark. Welcome back into my life. All right, there's much water come on the project. Oh, me. Have mercy on me. Keep an eye on the cake and don't eat any of the chocolate or the smarties. When you're not there, do your kids do as they're told? Did any of you eat some of the decorations?

This week, we want to find the boredest kids, and there are a lot of bored ones out there. Yesterday's winner, Ila, was so bored that she trimmed the lawn with scissors. Come around into mine, actually, by the way, Isla. Now, today, she has got some competition, and Owen and Ashland were not super excited about going for a bushwalk. Lennox got bored at a wedding, so he's taking five on the deck. Fair enough. Those were great, but they just could not top Oscar. He was pretty uninterested in being sung, happy birthday, by his past hearts. Good on your Oscar. Oh, if you think you can beat that, send us your entry via Facebook, and you could be taking home $300 worth of boredom-busting Lego. Now, tomorrow, this could be a shocker for your pet.
