I'm Bernardine Oliver Kerby, you with AM early. A suite of measures to tackle gang crime is just the start for the new Justice Minister. Ram raids as well as smashing grabs continue to be on the government's fixed list, with offenders as young as 12 coming to the attention of police. Justice Minister Kerry Allen told NewsHub late further interventions are on the way. One of the things that we've said is that we're always looking at further measures, but youth justice is an area that we will be looking to make some more announcements in due force. Wednesday's announcement will give police more power to seize weapons, cash and vehicles, with tougher prison sentences for those attempting to intimidate other people. Auckland police are investigating a spate of jewelry store smashing grabs after two more shops were hit on Wednesday. The first robbery was in St John's where two men entered the Meadowbank shopping centre with a gun and a hammer just before 1pm. Later in the day, four people smashed their way into diamonds on Richmond in Grey Lynn. Police say the thieves car with stolen items inside was found thereby. These latest incidents come after at least two other jewellery straw robberies in Auckland earlier in the week. The COVID-19 response minister will give an update on the traffic light settings this afternoon as case numbers continue to surge. It's expected the country will remain at orange, but Minister Aishevira will announce a plan to make it easier to access masks and rapid antigen tests. Speaking in Fiji on Wednesday, Prime Minister Jacinda Dern said going to the red setting hasn't been considered. Instead, the focus has been on supporting people to self-manage COVID infections. Sri Lanka's political crisis has significantly worsened overnight as protests intensify. President Gotabaya Roger Paxa has fled to the Maldives without resigning, sparking a surge of demonstrations in the country. In his place, he's appointed former Prime Minister,ul Wakhrima Sengaya as acting ruler. The disgraced leader had also promised to resign this week, but is instead called for military enforcement of curfews. He's labelled the protest movement radical and in need of disciplining. Because of today's situation, the security forces advise me to declare a state of emergency and impose a curfew. Thereby I'm now implementing both these measures. We must defeat this fascist threat. Since the curfew was imposed, protesters have taken control of the Prime Minister's own living quarters, prompting police to fire tear gas into the crowds. The global cost of living crisis is taking its toll forcing thousands of businesses into bankruptcy. More than 1,200 bakeries have closed this year in South Korea alone as flower prices saw. The country's central bank has lifted its benchmark interest rate by a record 50 basis points to 2.25% overnight. Meanwhile, Germany is suffering what's being described as an acute social crisis as inflation hits 8.2%. Local officials say it hasn't been this high in nearly half a century. Sports news and Queensland have pulled off a heroic performance to earn a state of origin upset beating New South Wales 22 to 12 to clinch the series win in Brisbane. The Maroons opened the scoring and what was a feisty affair before the Blues responded with two tries of their own to lead 1210 at the break. The second half erupted into chaos in the opening minute when sent is Matt Burton and Dane Gagi. We're sent to the Sinban after sparking an all-in-brawl. Staff all back. Kaelin Ponga gave Queensland the go-ahead try before Hooker Ben Hunt charged the ball down and ran 60 metres to clinch the victory. Queensland. Loss for words. I can't thank everyone that's come here tonight to support us enough. We knew coming here it was going to be something special and we did it again. It's so good. If you're a Queensland fan, the silver ferns have made a promising start to their Quad Series campaign thrashing New Zealand A, 67 to 48 in Auckland. After a tight opening half, the ferns took things up a notch after the break as they extended their advantage to 12 points, 12 goals. The clinical final quarter saw them stretch their margin to 19th, earning them a dominant win over the New Zealand and securing Gina Crampton, her first win as captain. I'm really proud tonight. I think that was a really good effort from us. We had so many different combos out there as well. I think that shows the depth of our team. But yeah, stoked with that scoreline, that's really impressive against a really strong NZA size. Bodes well for Birmingham. Let's take a look at the weather for Thursday.

It is coming up to 20 minutes to 6. The government's announced a massive crackdown on gangs, giving police a new range of paths to seize goods and search property to discuss. I'm joined by Act Leader David Seymour from Cambridge. Good morning to a beautiful part of the country. It sure is. Trees and champions. It certainly is. And thoroughbred horses. Look, I want to start with at the Tapati Māori's annual conference over the weekend. Rauri Waititi made a comment. He made a joke about poisoning you with seeds, poisonous seeds in his Karaka necklace. What did you make of it? Oh, look, it was a bit more than that. I mean, he also said, you know, re-indigionise yourself. And we've also had the president of a Maori party, John Tamahiri, say, act as the white settler party and you should go to Australia. When a political party starts singling people out by race, saying we're going to poison you, you don't belong in our community and you should leave. That's actually hateful. And I think those guys need to explain that because if it was anyone else, I think there would be a total outcry, but it's certainly a type of rhetoric that does not belong in New Zealand politics. So you've got a sense of humour presumably, David. We've all heard that. Gosh, you did dancing with the stars, didn't you? But there's a line, isn't there? Yeah, look, I do have a sense of humour. You'd have to. But, you know, threatening violence, threatening to poison people, saying people don't belong in our community based on their race. That kind of behaviour doesn't belong in New Zealand politics. And do you think anyone else in another major party doing the same behaviour would get away with that? Oh look, I think we all know that if it was someone else in any other party saying the same thing, then there would be an absolute outcry. It would lead the news on every channel. All right, let's move on to the government's plan on cracking down on gangs. What did you make of the announcement yesterday? Oh, absolutely astonishing. I mean, even six months ago, the government was saying on cracking down on gangs. What did you make of the announcement yesterday? Oh, absolutely astonishing. I mean, even six months ago, the government was saying we're doing everything we can. There's no problem. Now they're starting to take practical steps to hit the sources of wealth that drive crime. This is something Acts been saying for a long time. You've got to follow the money, declare open season on their assets, set the IRD on them, because so long as it's profitable to deal illegal drugs and misery, they will find a way to keep doing it. So look, it's very encouraging. I would still say not just $10,000 cash, if you're caught with illegal guns, stealing illegal drugs, it's open season on your assets. And by the way, we're going to set the IRD on you to make you explain the source of your wealth. But what the government's just done is a massive U-turn. It's far too late given the amount of gang activity that's out there, but it's very encouraging. It is a step in the right direction, no doubt, about it. But I guess it's going to be quite hard to police those things, given the frontline numbers, perhaps not where they should be? Yeah, look, the police are under huge pressure because we basically made them keep citizens in their hotel rooms for two years and make Auckland to stay in their city for six months with the lockdowns we had. Those are the problems that have allowed this gang culture to grow up to the point where gangs ride around like they own the place instead of the people who actually pay for New Zealand through their taxes. So it is going to take a long time to turn that around. That's why they should never have been neglected the way they have been. But at least now the government is starting to get to root causes and practical cause and effect thinking. So that's positive, but it would have been better if they'd had this attitude two years ago when we started telling them. Well, a couple of years ago is when we first had COVID, and there's been lots of chat about our reaction to it and how it's been handled. COVID cases are now soaring 11,000 plus a day, projections of 20,000 next month. Should we move to the red setting? No, even the Prime Minister accepts they won't make much difference. It's spreading through everyday life to limit large gatherings would simply decimate hospitality and events and they've been through enough uncertainty already. I think what is important is that we have an approach that is proportional to the risk. Our isolation periods are still far too long. People have to isolate for a week with their partner being ill in their household. Then another week, if they get it themselves. People are being taken out of the workforce for two weeks, even though they're in the infectious for a few days. We should have a Singapore-style isolation period three days and out with a negative test. That would be much smarter than what we do now because it's decimating schools, hospitals, you name the sector. People are being taken out by unworkable isolation rules. I see you've announced a number of changes that you would make in the first 100 days of power. You've rattled off a few there that perhaps would be injected in. Bringing back the 90-day trials, bring back the three strikes, bring back charter schools. What would be top of your list? We've got a short time to go, David. So what's kind of your top area? Also tax, which will interest a lot of people? Look, getting on top of the cost of living by reducing government expenditure is crucial. So long as the government keeps overspending, Adrian Orr is going to keep putting your mortgage up. And people are just so badly squeezed by a combination of rising prices, rising mortgage rates. The one thing the government can do is stop spending so much money wastefully. People say it's a global problem. It's because other governments are wastefully spending as well. So let's get back on top of government spending, reduce inflation, take the pressure off Adrian Orr to put up your mortgage rate and give people some relief on the cost of living. If you cut the 39 cent tax rate, we're not going to be paid for the cost of living crisis and the health crisis, though, are we? Because we're in a couple of those. Cost of living crisis and the health crisis, though, are we? Because we're in a couple of those. You know, the government spent $128 billion last year. Their estimates are that that 39 cent tax rate raises only 400 million, in other words, about 0.3% of that revenue. The 39 cent tax rate does not raise significant revenue. It's barely noticeable. What it does do is send a message to every kid watching. If you do really well, we'll take even more of your money. It's tall poppy syndrome in the tax code. It is not the values that you build a striving, successful country on. What we really need in New Zealand is a culture of success so that we become wealthier and don't fall further behind the rest of the world. Act leader David Seymour from beautiful Cambridge and the Waikato. Good to chat this morning. To international news now where inflation is the highest it's been in decades for the United States. And joining us now with the very latest is AMUS reporter Lachlan Cartwright from NYC. And a belated happy birthday. You turned 30 last week and you celebrated. Cheers. Good to be back, Bernardine. You're very kind. I celebrated the big 40, which is actually, talk about inflation. It's a 40-year high. I actually went out for a coffee and an avow toast just before this and it was 20 bucks. You is. So inflation is up 9.1% and consumers are getting squeezed, not just at the coffee shops, but obviously at the petrol tank. And as you know, I went on this road trip from the east to the west coast. And it was pretty evident. and that was several weeks ago. But now we know it's up 9.1% of 40-year high. It's extraordinary. So I've just Googled very quickly what your $20 US, is it's $32.48. So for a coffee and avow and toast, you paid $32 New Zealand dollars this morning. Might want to make it tomorrow morning, I reckon. But look, the pressure is going to be on Biden and on the government to try and do something, to try and alleviate the stress that's going on here, because rents are up. I just renewed my lease, actually. That was the first I did when I got back. It's up $250 a month. Can you believe that? And rents are up, the price is up everywhere. So it's going to be sort of interesting to see what the government, there's only so much they can do to try and alleviate this. So what's Biden going to do from Saudi Arabia? Because he's on a plane, Tiki touring there. He is. And this is going to be quite an interesting foreign trip. Actually, it's his first trip to the Middle East since taking office. And it is to Saudi Arabia. That's a government, a country he talked about as a pariah when he was first came to office. Now, he's obviously going out there to try and ease some of the concerns over rising oil prices. But the Saudi is really having the last laugh here because Biden, it was Biden who declassified that report, that intel report into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi that fingered MBS, the Saudi leader, as being the mastermind behind it. So do you reckon that is going to get much chat at the old dinner table when they sit down? It really does seem like Biden has to eat humble pie here and try and work with the Saudis to try and alleviate some of this inflation. Yes, indeed. Show them some love. Showing Trump some love is the media. The media can't get enough of him. He can't let go of the spotlight. What's the very latest from Team Trump? Well, these January 6 hearings are more engrossing than the Johnny Depp Amber Herb trial, if you can believe that Congress could be that interesting. They're being produced by a former ABC Nightline boss, and they have just produced startling revelation after startling revelation that showed well just before that insurrection happened that Trump's inner circle, people like Jared Kushner, Bill Barr, they all knew that it was cooked. They all knew that Trump had lost, but they continued to try and proclaim Trump as he was really just trying to hang on to power, much like a coup that you would associate with a despot government. And the revelations just go to show that he really was jitting up his supporters in the days leading up to January 6th. So this has really kind of dented Trump's popularity, which you imagine, within Republicans. There was a poll out recently recently that only 50% of Republicans would vote for him again. So this could really be the tipping point to seeing DeSantis being the Florida governor, being the real runner and writer for the Republicans come 2024. So watch this space. We shall indeed. And you enjoy the rest of your birthday celebrations in one of my favourite parts of the world. New York. Get yourself a pretzel, something special. You know, what do they do in New York? A pretzel on the street corner? Just not a 20-buck avocado and toastburn. Yeah, save up for that one. You have that next year on your 31st birthday. AMU.S reporter Lockland Cartwright.

Norma, Hokiemiya, you with AM early. It is six minutes to six. Time now to check-in with our reporters around the country and it is Morena to Nat's Levy in Auckland. Nats, it seems like you're not even safe shopping during the day, more daylight robberies. Yeah, that's right, Byrne. It is not safe times, even during the day, especially if robberies? Yeah, that's right, Byrne. It is not safe times, even during the day, especially if you're a jewellery store. Yesterday evening, Wednesday evening, at quarter to five, a store was targeted in Grayland where there was smash glass, goods were taken, and four people escaped in a vehicle. And this is just shy, four hours shy, of a robbery that took place in Meadowbank, where in broad daylight, two armed offenders robbed a store. And what's even more amazing is that a woman in her 70s ran and leapt on an armed offender, an aide to stop this robbery. Ran and left burn. These offenders were armed with hammers and a gun. So this is amazing. And if you are this woman or you know this woman, we'd love to hear from you. Feedback at theamshow.co.com.com. We'd love to talk to you. But the spate of robberies is concerning and they are escalating. The jewellery store owner for the store in Meadowbank owns three stores and said this is the fifth time they've been a victim in 17 months. And this is the fourth robbery in a week for Auckland. Scary, disparaging. Yeah, crazy times, isn't it? And yeah, the fourth robbery in a week for Auckland. Scary, disparaging. Yeah, crazy times, isn't it? And yeah, the hunt for Super Grand is on. Thanks for that, Nat. Let's head to Tear McDougal in Wellington. And doggy owners beware. Absolutely. Good morning, Bernardine. Dog owners have been told to beware when walking along the Hutt River and in that area because the 1080 possum poison has been flushed down towards walking tracks because of the previous couple days, heavy rain. We've had some pretty heavy rain down there and now that 1080 poison that is in the bushes along the walking tracks has been washed down towards the river so it's kind of scattered everywhere in the past. This has killed dogs. The Hutt City Council has actually come under flack for not advertising and letting dog walkers know well in advance that this could be a potential threat to their dogs and dogs have died. So now there is a big call going out there to be where. There have been a couple dead possums be washed down as well. So this is along the Hutt River as long as Kaitoake Regional Park and even along Patoni Beach dog owners are told to be where there. If their dog does consume some of this poison, they have been told to get their dog to a vet immediately and if they can't try to get their dog to vomit. So not a very pleasant time for our furry friends but I'm sure everybody will keep an eye out for them. Yeah, real worried for dog owners for sure. Thanks for that tear. Let's head to Otatahi Christsearch. Good morning to Mitch Redmond. Mitch, I cannot believe that this is Christchurch. Good morning to Mitch Redmond. Mitch, I cannot believe that this is D-Day. I'd be amazed if we have a result at the end of it, but we're talking to the stadium, a result today. Yeah, good morning, Byrne. It's been a whole decade full of yeses, noes, noes, not now's and maybe later's, but finally we will get a decision today on the future of Christchurch's Stadium. Just after 10 o'clock this morning, 16 councillors and Mayor Leanne D'Alesel will be forced into making a decision on what they want done with the stadium before the end of the day. Now, the most recent bump in the stadium's road has been due to rising construction costs and the basis of today's meeting will be deciding whether to take on an extra $150 million to that total budget. But if the stadium is agreed to today, those working in the background of this project have settled on a fixed final cost of $683 million. Now, more than 30,000 Cantabrians did speak out and submit a submission on what they want done with this stadium. An overwhelming 77% of those were in favour of going ahead with the build. But just after 8 o'clock this morning, Papanui Councillor Mike Davidson will be on AM to discuss the scale of today's decision. Many councillors are feeling like they are being rushed into making a decision today, but no doubt it's going to be an interesting day ahead. Wow, feeling rushed. We've only had years and years and years to thrash this one out, but anyway, D-Day, we shall wait and watch. Thanks for that, Mitch. Those are our reporters around the motto. That was AM early. Time now, two minutes to six."}
