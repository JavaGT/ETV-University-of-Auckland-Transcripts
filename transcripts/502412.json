Without my queen, I can't represent. Are we going to this ball or not? We've got to make things with more friends tonight. So what happened to our special drinks? And how to go asking for him, can I? Wow. Duss. It does. I wish you hadn't told me. Sorry? About this dead. It's a big thing to dump on me. You wanted to know what was wrong. Okay, I know we're not together, but there's not many people I can trust, and you're still on that list. Okay, but what am I going to do when I see Viv? I won't be able to look her in the eye. How do you think it is for me? But that was Lorraine's deathbed confession, a sacred moment. You need to tell Vib, and Norm. No, not my news to share. Good morning. Gosh, you two look, Graham. Did somebody die? Here. Okay, so you're saying it's basically a confessional situation. Yes, and you know the rules. You're not a priest. But she trusted me with her secret. And you told me. You pushed me to tell you. You told me, because deep down, you know Viv deserves the truth. And you need confirmation on that. It feels wrong that the only two people in the world who know about this are you and me. NTK. Hey? Was he there? No, I told him. I didn't know what else to do. Okay, so I went to him for advice as my CEO. And what did he say? To let sleeping dogs lie. And that's right with you to keep lying to Viv, like she's been lie to her whole life. I never wanted to be given this burden, Viliami. And don't carry it. Tell her or I will. Don't you dare. This will turn her world upside down. Viv's lost her mother and Norm's fresh out of surgery, possibly so- What are you doing? Making D-O-N. I'm just trying to show leadership by helping out. Nice to be you to lend us a hand. Anyway, are you coming to my session this morning? I don't know. And Billy, you can leave this with me. I don't want to hold you up. We're going to miss Dawn. Little energize a bunny. Never knowing who she's going to punch. You'll survive next. Yeah, okay. Can you not talk so loud? What was that? I hate you. Oh, on that note, good morning. Sneaking to Chris's exam. He'll hook out with some saline. Yeah, yeah, nothing a little caffeine can't fix. Where were you anyway? Stuck here. First dad went down to him, so it was all hands on deck. Oh, what happened? Hemoneumith. Poor Norm. Poor Norm. Poor Vov. Now the rumours are going around. Rumours? Uh, what are they saying? Well, the Norma crashed his car. Oh, let's not speculate. How is he this morning? Still with hypotency. I'll do a re-scan. He may still be bleeding. Yeah, well, worst-case scenario, you could take him back to theatre. Yeah. I'll be getting this guy in again if he's up for it. Of course. He needs more blood. But if she'll get tested after all, she must be a donor. Yeah, yeah, I'll set it up. She's desperate to be a match. What's going on? Nothing. You went all funny before about the rumours. No, I didn't. Are there more rumours? Is there something you're not saying? Because if whatever it is affects the surgical outcome. Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't want to tell you, but... Flat white. Nothing like a bought one. Gosh, thank you. Chop, chop. We're due in soon. Jeez, you've got a spring in your step. Oh, well, it's a new day.

We'll track this guy here, then talk through some cases in AD. We can't have everyone clogging up the cubicles, though. True. Where's me cool? No, no, I'm not her mind, dear. Okay, so Lovely, you're in. Who else? Sorry, I've got to go. Okay, well, maybe someone sent me a message. This dumb laptop would let me log in. Are you here? Yeah. It's my wounds assessment thing. Oh, you count me out. I still haven't finished the case study. You're asking a good. I'm keen to learn new stuff. Ta. And one-on-one with you. What's like you mean? So how would it be? It's tired. And he's hopped up to to a few machines but nothing to be frightened on. Dad. There's my girl. Oh, you've messed yourself up a bit, don't you? Well, you know me. I don't do things by halves. How are you feeling? Well, I don't feel anything at the moment. We can keep that up, right? So what happened in the car? Well, you think I know the difference between an accelerator and a break by now. Like an idiot, I hit the wrong pedal. So it was an accident? Of course, sweetheart. So what happened? You seemed fine when you left me. No, I was... I was feeling a bit lost. Went to a bar. Oh, Dad. I had a few drinks. Normally I know my limit, but things don't feel very normal right now. Why didn't you call me? Tell me how you were feeling? I didn't want to worry you. Well, how bloody worried you think I was when I heard you were an ED? I'm sorry it was all a stupid blur. I didn't you for one second? Just think about me. Well, I wasn't. How I might be feeling, losing my mum and then my dad. Livy, love, I'm sorry. How could you even... I... Why? It's not just about you, Dad. You're not the only one in this, or don't you even care about me at all? This is Coop. Coupes. Sorry, Coops. Lacerations left hand and face. No other complaints. All vitals okay. Hi, I'm Jack. One of the doctors here. Okay to get you up on this bed? Go. Oh, laceration. Perfect. So what happened, mate? Fell over. Pretty stupid. Fell over. Onto what? That looks like a pretty nasty cut. Oh, just onto some rocks, eh? Rocks? Tripped up. Yeah, right? So good enough. Agreed. Either way, we address a tissue viability, right? So viable is red, granulating. Or pink, which is epithelializing. You're on to it. You might need to look at stitching this one up. Can you please get the suture trolley? Sure. So when you fell, uh, how did you land? Coupes? Yeah, I can't really remember what happened. So you stitch me up and I'll get out of you. We'll just need you to fill out our ACC. Nah.

I shouldn't have gone off at him. The last thing he needs. You were upset. What about him? So low and so deeply unhappy that he could... He'll feel better having talked to you. You think? He didn't want to talk to me before he... We are all that we have. How could he want to leave me? I'm sure he didn't. He was confused, upset, sad. I know that, but I didn't know it was that bad. God, what is wrong with me? Well, you're grieving too. All that worked with the Phoenix Trust, and I didn't know it was that bad. God, what is wrong with me? Well, you're grieving too. All that worked with the Phoenix Trust, and I couldn't even read the signs. Hey, this is not your fault. Grief messes with your head, and if he's anything like me. Well, you wouldn't want to just end it. Abandon the people that you love. Oh, God. I'm sorry. My big mouth. It's okay. I just need you to hear two things. Really hear them, okay?

So this could knock them both apart. You know, why are we even gossiping about other people's family stuff? Well, we hear about Viv. We want to help. Yeah, I suppose. And Lorraine obviously had her reason. Okay, in code, please? Well, look at my father. Useless waste of space. Better off without him. At least Norm stuck around. Stop it, with the names. I mean, it's just, you know, incredibly sad for the daughter. You know, with the current patient's situation being so incredibly sad. I mean, it must be really hard to deal with. Hey, I can't stop thinking about that Coops guy. Yeah? Yeah. Is that icing on your cheek? Oh. Oh, he couldn't get away fast enough. Yeah, well, I hope he sorts that cut out, okay? Hmm, and did you see him shine away from the police? Like, what's up with that? Reyesis this? Just a patient we had. Oh, plenty of reasons not just cops, eh? True that. Oh, uh, it's for you. Hey? I just saw you find a way for laptops, so... Wait, no, you don't have to give me a laptop. My mate was chucking it. I had in my car. What about you? Don't you need it?

This is really bad. So will the judges feel the love? It's not a sexy dish to me at all. Mastership Fans and Faze, mixed on two and on TV in Zip Plus. I don't know if I can do this. You can. Remember what I said. We can help each other. Do you want me to come in? No. No, you're right. I can do it. I have to. Sweet Dad, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you. I was just a stupid old fool. Stop it. No one talked about my dad like that. I love you. I love you too, very so much. We're going to get through this together. Of course. Me and my girl. My love. Surprise. I don't think of you back for ages. Yeah, well, I just had to come back and see you. I, um, saw you having fun at the reunion. Oh, yeah, well, it was nothing without my man by my side. Was there really a sick Cousie? Yeah, Cousie Janie. Oh she is sick as a dog but she wouldn't take her medication so they needed somebody bossy and that's why they called me in. Hello? I thought you didn't want me there. Oh of course I want you Damo. I just I didn't want you to have to choose you know between me or the condor ball. Really? Yeah, I know how much it means to you. Condor is everything. And honestly, I mean, you don't need Chantel's better half-breathing a salmon breathed down your neck. Honestly, that man, he's like Jabba the heart, but with a moustache, you know? Actually, he's from the heart, so maybe I should just call him Jabba from now on. But you never gave me the chance. I would choose you over Condor any day. Oh, Damo. I should have asked me. Yeah. I should have. And look, I'm sorry, okay? Can you forgive me? And I will never cut you out of my life again. Well, I mean, you know, forgiveness is always possible. Yeah. So how was the Condor ball? Rockin and rolling? Yeah. Was the Dragon of Kuan there? Did you solve all the riddles? Do you really need to ask? No, that was the Dragon of Kuan there? Did you solve all the riddles? Do you really need to ask? No, that's right, my smart. Sexy. Clever Lord of Condor. Now I need to go and find Jojo. Jojo? Yeah, I need to make sure she's not running our place into the ground. She has got some crazy ideas just a heads up, bit of a fruit loop. Oh yeah, well as long as she runs all of those ideas by me then we'll be fine. I think I'll sit between you in case anyone starts throwing knives. We are getting back on track. Finally. I reckon. Who is this? Mine, kind of. Kind of. I just got given it. Yeah, it was weird. Lovely's boyfriend turned up, said his mate didn't need it anymore, so... Wowza. What? Who was this guy, some billionaire? What do you mean? Is this honestly a second-hand laptop? Well, that's what he said. I mean, you're looking at like four and a half, five grand here. What? No way. And he just gave it to you? Yeah. Yeah, I'd been mouthing off about my old way. And he just gave it to you? Yeah. Yeah, I'd been mouthing off about my old one. He was just like, here you go. It's clean as. It's basically unused. It's nuts. Who's this guy to have any more mates? Hey, didn't think you'd be at work? Oh, it's closer to Dad here, and I can pop in and out when he needs me and check in on what he wants for mum's funeral. So he's feeling well enough to talk about that? Well, it's still horrible, obviously, for the both of us. I think he's going to be okay. I'm going to make sure of it. It's good. And I know people were talking. There were rumours, but we're putting all that, I'm going to make sure of it. It's good. And I know people were talking. There were rumours, but we're putting all that behind us. I just want to get Dad better. And what? You don't think I can do it? No, it's not bad. What then? What's it going on? Talk to me. Okay, look. I'm telling you this, because people are still talking, and I don't want you to hear it through the grapevine. Yeah, what? Madonna was there when your mum passed away. Yeah, I know. And Lorraine told her something before she died. Okay. What? That Norm isn't your biological father. No. That's what she told her. It was like a deathbed confession. No, it was the ramblings of a delusional woman who was drugged up to the eyeballs. Madonna thought she was... I don't care what Madonna thinks. It's not true. Perv. You know what? I have just made up with my father after the most awful experience and you're spouting lies like this. I'm telling you this as your friend. They're not lying. Oh, you are no friend of mine. Get out. Say hi to Barry for me. And Dave. Okay. Love you. Thank you. Can't have my baby getting cold. Isn't he just the best? Catch him not. That was nice. Got to look after my girl. You're an iron dog. So? What the hell are you doing here? Mate, I'm not looking to cause any trouble. You're an iron dog. So? What the hell are you doing here? I'm not looking to cause any trouble. Hey, we're not mates. I would never be mates with a low-life scum. You just need to calm down, eh? You need to get out of here. You need to back off. You want security down here, huh? You want the cops? Is that what you want? I want you to get a crap. What the hell did my mother say to you? Nothing spreads faster. This could just be some big stupid, delusional mistake. Than gossip. Everyone in the whole damn world knows except for me. Shortland Street, tomorrow at 7 on 2 and TV and Z Plus."}
