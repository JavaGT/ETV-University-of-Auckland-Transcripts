You're with AM. It's wonderful to have your company, and thanks, of course, to our partner's course. Good morning, Ryan. Good morning. Good to see you. Good morning, everybody. Now, driving into work this morning, there was a news flash, actually, that came across the radio. And it was from none other than our esteemed co-host, Bernardine Oliver Kirby. I thought, this woman doesn't work enough. She is at like, what was it, 3.30 in the morning, 3.25 in the morning. And they said, we've just had a report from Bernardine Oliver Kirby that there was a crash on the motorway. It was actually awful to watch, and I thought, public service. It had obviously just happened. There were no ambulances, police on the scene. I was heading south on the motorway to come to work. This was heading north, so approaching the harbour bridge. And there were two cars both facing the other way, one just almost unrecognisable in the front, and someone on a phone standing in the middle. So it was actually awful to see. It had just happened, and I thought, you know, if someone's roaring on the motorway, you know, approaching that, it could be really, really dangerous. It had just happened, and it was actually really awful, so I do hope everyone involved in that is okay this morning. Yeah, absolutely. And that's why I did, I'll rank my mate Miles on ZB, I gave my corset, Miles has been an accident. Yeah, no, it's a good thing to do because as you say it's very, very scary coming across an accident like that, particularly if you've ever been passing it, and we all look don't we? I mean, that's the reality. I mean, obviously you couldn't avoid looking at it. But we all tend to have a look, don't we? And it's just such a grim thing to discover to look at. But this would have actually closed off all the lanes. No one got past. I thought if you wore up, you're going to be throwing on the anchors to try and stop and avoid further disaster. Yeah. Let's hope everyone... Apparently that's all cleared up. Yeah. Okay, this morning. Right, lots to come on the show this morning. It's been revealed the government was slow to act on health advice to scrap its controversial MIQ system. COVID-19 Minister Crips, HIPkins, is here to explain why. That's just after 6.30. MIQ remained for several months after this, meaning tens of thousands of Kiwis were refused entry to come home over the summer period. One of them was heavily pregnant journalist, Charlotte Ballas. She is with us at 10 past 7 this morning. Inflation is tipped to hit record levels this week, but is this the peak or is there more paying to come? Former Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash and A&Z economist Finn Robinson discussed this with us at 720. And Australia says it's deeply disappointed that the Solomon Islands has signed a security pact with China that could open the door to a Chinese naval base in the South Pacific. Our Australia correspondent has the latest just before seven. Right now, time for news. At the money at 6 o'clock, a controversial security pact between China and the Solomon Islands has been signed. China's foreign ministries confirmed that the two countries have agreed on the deal, which could pave the way for a Chinese naval base to be developed in the Pacific. A spokesperson for the foreign ministry says the deal will help maintain social order and safety in the island nation. The issue of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region is being discussed during Prime Minister Jacinda Adirne's trip to Singapore and Japan. Well, we did discuss developments in the Pacific region and particularly China's growing interests in the region. We are not familiar with the details of the agreement, so we're not able to comment upon that. Back here, a 22-year-old has died in Christchurch following a serious crash on Tuesday evening. Two motorcycles and one vehicle were involved in the accident shortly before 7 in Halsville. A second person remains in Christchurch Hospital with serious injuries. State Highway 75 has reopened, but motorists are being warned of delays this morning. Police are concerned poor weather could hamper the search for a missing fishermen off the east coast near Apotiki. An assessment of the conditions will be undertaken this morning to decide if police, coast guard and the Air Force should resume their efforts for a fourth day. Members of the public are still being asked to keep an eye out for items of interest including a white chili bin, wooden oars and a yellow life jacket along the shore between Torredi and Makatu. British lawmakers are once again calling for Boris Johnson's resignation. The embattled Prime Minister has apologised for a second time for breaking lockdown rules being met with jeers and booze when he entered the house. It follows the infringement notice he received for attending an illegal function at Darling Street. While he says he's paid the fine, he maintains that he never deliberately misled the House or the public. It did not occur to me then or subsequently that a gathering in the cabinet room just before a vital meeting on COVID strategy could amount to a breach of the rules. Johnson says it's time the UK moved on and focused on bigger issues like the crisis in Ukraine. But the leader of the opposition, Sir Kirstama, has fought back, doubling down on claims that Johnson should go. What a joke. Even now, as the latest merely mouthed apology stumbles out of one side of his mouth, a new set of deflections and distortions pour from the other. In sport, Hurricanes winger Julian Severe is hopeful of an all-black's recall, but admits there's still a lot that needs to happen before he dons that jersey again. The 31-year-old has been one of the Kane's top players this season, cementing himself as a key starter in the side. While he'd welcome the chance to run out again for the All-Black Severe, isn't getting ahead of himself in the race to earn a spot in Ian Foster's squad. 100%. That's definitely something in my head anyway. But in saying that, there's still a long way to go. I know the talent among the A-Bs there is quite huge. Former Kiwi's half, Tamarai Martin, set for a remarkable return to the NRL after a brain bleed, forced him to retire two years ago. Martin has previously had stints at the Panthers and the Carboys playing in the 2017 grand final for North Queensland. In 2019 it was discovered he had a small bleed on his brain, forcing him to end his career early. After getting the all-clear from the doctor, he played for Whitechato in last year's NPC before being snapped up by the Brisbane Broncos. He's been named at fullback for their game against the Bulldogs on Friday night. Great, and that's the very latest from News Hub. It's four minutes past six. Thanks very much, Bernardine. You might have seen in the news yesterday. It was just a brief mention yesterday afternoon about this memo that was sent on the 12th of November to... This was a remember when people were being locked up in MIQ and desperately wanted to get out and desperately wanted to see their families. This was a memo from Caroline McElnallnay, who's the Director of Public Health at the Ministry of Health. It was sent to Ashley Bloomfield and then passed on to the government. And it basically said there was no need for MIQ anymore. We needed to ditch the system. It was no longer justified and set out all the reasons for that. It also mentioned a couple of other things about how they might do that and the need for a bit of a gap between stopping MIQ and doing something else. But here it was in the government's inbox and it wasn't until about three and a half months later that finally MIQ was ditched. And in that time, as we've just outlined, thousands of people didn't get to bury their loved ones, didn't get to say goodbye to their loved ones, didn't get to deliver their babies in New Zealand. We'll talk to one of them later. The question this morning is why? And thousands of people, as you say, did not get to come back. And the government's response will be that Omicron came after the 12th of November and that MIQ needed to stay but if the public health advice on the 12th of November when Delta was spreading in the community was that international arrivals were no longer any higher risk than people here spreading COVID-19 why weren't we told of that? Should we know? I mean the Director of Public Health is a non-political role, giving advice to politicians. Should that be public information? Plus, after that, so, you know, that all dies down. Anyway, they announced we're going to open the floodgates and MIQ will end, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And here we are. They were fighting it with the journalist involved to keep this little document secret so that you wouldn't know what was in it, so that you would be kept in the dark. Why the secrecy? Why did it take going to the ombudsman, who's like the referee in these kinds of disputes, isn't it? Why did it take going to him to actually get this document into public hands? Very good questions, I think. And what about all the people, not only who missed out, at the extreme end, the people that missed out on coming back to see their dying relatives, but all those people who paid to come back and stay in MIQ? Yeah. They paid just $1,600. And the taxpayer funded some of that too. Lots of money. How much did it cost? So what we did yesterday was we asked Ashley Bloomfield. We asked, well, everyone, you know, write a list of your top ten. We asked them. Of course, the Prime Minister is overseas. So initially, when Chris Hickens declined our interview last night, we went back asking why we now have an interview. So at 6.35 this morning, Chris Hickens is live on the show. And let us know your thoughts. Feedback at aam show.com.NZ. But let's head to William now with a wrap of our weather this morning. Good morning, William. Good morning. Morena. Happy hump day. Come with me, William in the dark, look what we found here. It's a sculpture here in Manakou. And if you read over here, come with me, it's a... He taonga, hiranga, fakenui, Fanoo. A gift to portray the importance of family, which we all know is the most important thing in the world. As well as our weather around the Motu. Tomorrow's weather brought to you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. There are some heavy rain watchers across the country this morning to be aware of. Orange heavy rain morning in Tasman, Westland and Fjoland regions and high rainfall expected along with thunderstorms and large amounts of surface water. Heavy rain watches in Canabria and Otago regions, also in Bulla and western regions. Expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms. Now to the rest of your weather. A cloudy day in the lower south with showers developing in the afternoon or Tepoti Deneen, 20 degrees in Oamaru, a high of 18. To the west coast, heavy rain in periods with light nor easterlies developing in the afternoon. Peopel Tahi, Nilford Sound 19 degrees and Hokitika, 20. In Canabria, Mulbra expects some morning and evening cloud with possible showers in the afternoon, or Tautahi Christchurch on 23 degrees, Te' Wae Hararekeke-Blenum, a high of 24. Some morning cloud in the lower north with north-northe-easterly winds developing throughout, Te-Fangunia-Tara-Wallington, 21 degrees, and Faka-Ori-O-E-Marser, a high of 25. Now to the central plateau, you can expect cloudy periods and showers developing later in the day. Taupo 20 degrees and Fanganui a high of 27. To the east coast, expect high cloud coverage coupled with noreasterly breezes and scattered showers. Tauranga 22 degrees and Rotorua a high of 19. And to the top of Aaltearo, expect cloud coverage with some possible heavy rain, heavy showers in the morning, expected to ease by the afternoon. Damaki, Macaura, Auckland and Kaitaia both with a high of 24 degrees. All righty, you might be able to see rainbows end through there. We've all got memories there. I remember coming up when I was living in Kaiko, never even been to Auckland, the bright lights, but going to Rainbow's End, and I've been to Disneyland as well, and I'll tell you right now, Rainbow Zend is right up there. It is, isn't it? You can't beat the log flume. I always used to love the log flume, but was quite scared of the roller coaster until probably too late in life, to admit, without being embarrassed. Thanks very much, William. We'll catch up with you again a little bit later on. It's 10 minutes past six now. Ports of Auckland is once again under the spotlight over safety concerns after the death of another worker. The stevedore, a man in his 20s with a young baby, was working for an independent company at the port when he fell from a height yesterday. It follows a review last year that found the need for improvements to health and safety after three previous deaths since 2017. Maritime Union of New Zealand's National Secretary Craig Harrison wants a national inquiry into port safety, and Craig joins us now. Good morning, Craig. What would a national review do after there had been an independent review in March last year? What would the difference be? The difference would be the review was focused on the ports of Auckland. So if we look right around our country, if you look at the industry as a whole, I think we'd find the same processes and management in place right around the country. It's an industry that's under stress at the moment because the volumes are going up, people are working long hours. And if you think of the size of an industry, we're not that big compared for instance, like the construction industry, maybe there's 5,000 workers in New Zealand. But we feature really highly in the deaths and serious harm. And it's not unheard of for workers to work up to 70 hours in a seven-day period. Wow. So it requires that level of investigation to pull back and maybe a national standard or some codes of practice that are enforceable to rein it back into where it is. But shouldn't the investigations by Maritime New Zealand, which investigates if the accident happens offshore or works safe New Zealand, which investigate if it happens on site? Shouldn't those investigations be coming up with recommendations for health and safety? Well, they come up with some recommendations. We've seen numerous companies' fines and serious fines, and we know the ports of the Auckland store to face the death in the courts. But what we haven't got is regulations that are enforceable under law. So if you can compare us, for instance, with the trucking industry where you have hours of work, licensing. So we need that sort of level of control brought into it, which is a pretty dangerous industry. The Independent Review last March found that the relationship between the Maritime Union, which you're part of, and the Ports of Auckland, was such a bad relationship that it was hampering health and safety policies. Has that improved? Yeah, Ports of Auckland has been a big change. I've noticed in the port itself, the port company has been a big change in health and safety. But health and safety is continuous improvement. You know, you've just got to keep reviewing what you're doing. But if you look at the wide industry, we've made a lot of noise around the country about lifting health and safety in ports. There's still a lot of injury going on, as we know around. For instance, there was deaths in Gisman a couple years ago. There was a prosecution in Napier just recently about two workers being affixated in a hold. So it's sort of for a small industry we feature really highly. And if you compare us with a construction industry, which years ago was in a bit of a state, but now you don't hear much about it at all. But has it improved as a result of a better relationship between the union and the ports company? Yeah, in the port company it is. It's constructive now. We're working to try and make it safe and productive here. So is there a bad relationship with the other port companies? Is that why there has been no movement there? No, it's not so much their relationship with the port company. It's just there's no constraint. We can have, for an example, one stewardering company in a port working 70 hours with workers and another company might limit them to 58 hours. So you sort of wonder how can you have two standards in the same industry? And are people actually reporting incidents because there was a point in the last review that people didn't think anything would actually come of reporting an incident anyway, so they weren't bothering. There's a high level of not reporting at all. There's a high level of casual labour and engagement in the industry, so a lot of casual labour won't make much noise because they're frightened and not getting a phone call the next couple of days for more work. So there's a lot of under-reporting going on in the industry. Right. Maritime Union of New Zealand's National Secretary Craig Harrison. Craig, thanks very much for being with us this morning. 14 minutes past 6. And after the break, National Party leader Christopher Luxon is here. What's his take on skyrocketing inflation? Plus, we have COVID-19 response minister Chris Hipkins with us to explain why the government stuck so steadfastly to the flawed MIQ system despite advice from health officials.

Ah, the feeling of New Zealand's most trusted internet connection. Welcome back at us 19 minutes after six. Great to have you watching the program. This morning, the government has advised, was advised, I should say, by top health officials in November last year, that MIQ was no longer justified yet the government continued for months with the controversial lottery system and misery was caused. This information was only made public yesterday it was reported first yesterday because the health ministry tried to keep it quiet from you and I. To discuss this I'm joined by the National Party leader Christopher Luxem. Good morning. Good to be with you in the studio. Yeah, it's great to have you here. Your thoughts on this? Look, I think the challenge here has been that MIQ's been pretty inhumane. It was a pretty poor system to start with. And the reality was the risk often wasn't in the community, not at the border. And so, you know, we don't get to see the information or the advice that the government gets, obviously, in opposition. It's great that you've got it, and I'll be very interested what Chris Eclan's got to say later on. But so do you feel that the government has been trying to hide this information, the Ministry of Health? It took the ombudsman to get it out. Yeah, look, I mean, we can go back through history, and it's, you know, you remember the times, I remember those months where we were actually advocating very strongly about saying, look, why is MIQ here? The risk isn't actually, you know, at the those months where we were actually advocating very strongly about saying, look, why is MIQ here? The risk isn't actually at the border anymore. There was actually very few people coming through that were in MIQ that were actually COVID positive at the time. And, you know, we were calling for it, I think, through a petition at the time as well, saying we've got to end this. Because there wasn't really a plan and there really wasn't any justification for MIQ and how it was working. People were some pretty tough situations, right? And now we know, because you didn't have the numbers, right? Now we know the positivity rate case numbers was between 0.2 and 0.3% of returnees. And you guys did do a petition, and you were roundly ridiculed for that. You were told that you were on the wrong side of science. You were told that you were going to give the country COVID for Christmas. Remember that as a national party? Yeah. So what do we make of that now? Well, look, I just think, you know, there's obviously a lack of openness and transparency and it's a government that said that they'd be very transparent about it. I think the other challenge was then it just hung around forever, even it was another three and a half months after this that we still had it. And it was very obvious that we actually had even Omicron then in the community, actually not at the border. And it took too long for it to be wound down, if you remember. And every week made a difference. Every day made a difference to people wanting to come home and see loved ones in tough situations. We've all had the leaders, haven't we, from people in Emukew? And wanting to get into New Zealand who couldn't. So what if he comes on here and says, oh, well, we had Omicron so lucky we didn't? Yeah, well, look, I think at the time of this article, when this advice came out, Omicron wasn't actually even in Australia at that point in time. Well, it didn't even exist. And there probably was an argument to say, well, actually, until we get clear on what Omicron actually is, if you remember what it was like in the moment of being unsure about what was coming. But the reality was even very quickly after that, you know, the reality was the threat was actually in the community, not at the border. When you look at the harm that MIQ has caused to those people the victims of it and let's call them victims because they have said it was traumatising, a survey found 80% of them had mental health issues, including depression and anxiety after being in this system. Do you think they're owed an apology by the Minister? Yeah, look, I think they are. I mean, the system was really inhumane. I mean, all of us as MPs were getting letters from people that were trying to get home for really dire and really challenging circumstances. And there was real unevenness. There was no prioritisation of cases of what was important versus what was not important. So an apology, do you think they are owed compensation? I'm not sure about that. I'd want to know more about sort of what we did or didn't know at the time and get a better sense from Chris Hickens after he talks to you. Okay. Sounds like you're waiting on a bit of information from the minister. Well, in fairness to us, you know, we don't actually get all that advice. You know, I don't see all of that advice. We have a view. We put our views forward pretty strongly. In future, do you, if we have another pandemic, and despite the government saying they were going to be the most open, honest and transparent, and they would be proactive releases of information, etc. Do you think, or if you were in government, would you release that information to the public? Well, look, I think you really wanted to build the case so there was high trust with the government. So you would have released these documents? I'd like to think that we would talk very openly about it, where the situation was and actually take the New Zealand people on that journey and explain to them what was actually happening. So you would proactively release memos like this as they came out so that when you were making decisions, people could see why. Yeah, I think you'd have to take people with you in a decision like that. I mean, it was really important. Okay. It was very confusing to New Zealanders as to why MIQ was there. We all had family members that were struggling to get home for different reasons. The justification or logic wasn't clearly understood. Okay, well Chris Hibkins, who is the Minister, will be on this program live in about 10, 12 minutes time. So stay tuned for that. In the meantime, Grant Robertson and Adrian, or the Reserve Bank Governor, coming out yesterday and saying he wants clearer communication from governments. Does he mean Grant Robertson? Yeah, he does. He does. I mean, the bottom line here is the government's blaming everybody but themselves for high inflation in New Zealand. Let's get really honest about it. New Zealand has a 5.9% inflation rate. Tomorrow it's probably going to be over 7%. Australia's got the same global pandemic challenges, the same supply chain issues. They're at 3.5%. The Prime Minister was in Singapore. Yesterday, they are at 2. She's going to Japan. They're at 1. So you're reading between the lines here. Adrian Or is saying to Grant Robertson without actually directly saying it, trim the fat mate. Absolutely, because he's saying it. The OECD has said it to New Zealand some months ago. And the National Party, since I've become leader, we've been saying it for the last five months, hey, listen, you've got a rain in that government's ending now. Because if you don't, it's going to drive domestic inflation, which is doing. Do you know what's kind of interesting? He's sort of agreeing with you now, isn't he? Yeah, well, the point is that there are things this government could be doing to actually diminish the impact of inflation. And if they could do their job, then it's not just all left to interest rates and Adrian Orr. All right. Chris, good to have you in the studio. Good to be here. Thanks so much. It has just gone 24 minutes after 6 o'clock. This is AM. After the news at 630, as we now know, after advice from health officials, the government took more than three months to ditch the MIQ system.

Ryan, sorry, Peter says, Ryan, the advice regarding MIQ was blocked because Ardun said they would be the most transparent government ever. Serita says, I find this appalling. We'll have more on that shortly, but now it is time for the news. Atamare, 630. The Maritime Union says a lack of safety standards and regulations is contributing to a high rate of accidents and deaths at our ports. It comes after Estevador is believed to have fallen to their death at the ports of Auckland on Tuesday. It's the fourth death involving the port or its operations in recent years. Maritime Union, National Secretary, Craig Harrison told AM an investigation is required to make sure workers are kept safe. Unheard of for workers to work up to 70 hours in a seven-day period. So it requires that level of investigation to pull back and maybe a national standard or some codes of practice that are enforceable to rein it back into where it is. Harrison is calling for the government to lead an inquiry into port safety. Regular ferry commuters from Auckland's Gulf Harbour will have to take the bus today as trips are cancelled due to the weather. Winds are expected to hit the shoreline where the ferry dock is making it too dangerous to operate. Signed, sealed, delivered. A controversial security pact between China and the Solomon Islands has been agreed to. China's foreign ministries confirmed the two countries have settled on the deal, which would pave the way for a Chinese naval base in the Pacific. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry says the deal will help maintain social order and safety in the island nation. Approved by the governments of China and Solomon Islands on behalf of both governments. We have formally signed a framework agreement on security cooperation. The issue of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region is being discussed during Prime Minister Jacinda Adirn's trip to Singapore and Japan. After weeks of warnings, the battle of eastern Ukraine has begun. Fiery clashes have erupted along Ukraine's eastern border as Russia's military forces try to take control of the Dombas region. The attacks are being met with serious resistance. President Vladimir Zelensky saying that no matter how many Russian troops are brought in, Ukraine will not give up any of its land. Foreign Minister Dmitro Kulibar has just addressed Bulgarian officials begging them to send aid. This Russia destroys, kills, torture, tortures, rapes. This is not Russia that deserves sympathy. Meanwhile, the assault on the Port City of Maripal continues with the region's largest steelworks going up in flames overnight. To sports news, and Tyson Fury has reaffirmed his desire to retire after he faces mandatory challenger Dillion White at Wembley Stadium. At a public workout, the heavyweight box confirmed that this weekend's bout will be his last fight and he will finally hang up the gloves. Fury's opponent, White, was a no-show at their training with a 34-year-old reportedly still at his base in Portugal. The Wellington Phoenix are confident they can finish inside the top four of the A-league, despite suffering a 4-0 defeat in their homecoming match. The next have one more game left in New Zealand, taking on Western Sydney at Eden Park on Sunday. Still firmly in the hunt for a spot in the finals, midfielder Reno Piscopos sure they can string the results together to secure a home playoff. We're very confident. We hope we can make top four and then play a couple of games back home again. We've missed out on that all year. So that's what we want. We want to play in front of our home fans in Wellington and we're looking forward to it. Finally at 630 Sydney police have been left baffled by a one in a million survival story. A driver in Redfern dodged death when a huge fig tree fell onto his car without warning. The massive tree crushed his convertible but miraculously the man behind the wheel emerged with barely a scratch. He was helped out by witnesses and council contractors were quickly on the scene, cutting up the tree and clearing it from the street. That's the very latest from News Hub. It is 27 minutes to 7. Thanks very much, Bernardine. And let's head to William. William, is that Darth Vader or something there behind you? More than, Mel. I think it's a rock or some sort. It's got some really lovely textures. I'm here in Karoro, Court, in the Mighty Manaco, and I think, yeah, got some nice textures. Do you know what that is, William? Flavors, morale. That's an MIQ hotel. There'll be some poor buggers still stuck inside that. Are they? You might be right. You might be right, hey. Hey guys, let's head to the weather at your place. Tomorrow's weather brought to you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. There are some heavy rain watches across the country this morning to be aware of. Orange heavy rain morning in Tasman, Westland and Fiordland regions with high rainfall expected along with thunderstorms and large amounts of surface water. Heavy rain watches in Canterbury and Otago regions, also in Bulla and westland regions. Expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms. Now to the rest of your weather. A cloudy day in the lower south with showers developing in the afternoon. Otepoeti dene dene in 20 degrees in Oamaru, high of 18. To the west coast, heavy rain in periods with light nor easterlies developing in the afternoon. Beopo Tahi Milford Sound, 19 degrees and Hokitika, 20. In Canabria, Mulbra expects some morning and evening cloud with possible showers in the afternoon, or Tautahi crashage on 23 degrees, and Tewee Harareke-Blenum, a high of 24. Some morning cloud in the lower north with northe nor-easterly winds developing throughout Te Fanganui atara-Walenton, 21 degrees and Faka Oori-Marserden, a high of 25. Now to the central plateau, you can expect cloudy periods and showers developing later in the day, Taupor 20 degrees and Fangunui a high of 27. To the east coast expect high cloud coverage coupled with northeasterly breezes and scattered showers, Tauranga 22 degrees and Rotorua a high of 19. And to the top of Altearoa, expect cloud coverage with some possible heavy showers in the morning, expected to ease by the afternoon, Damaki, Makota, Auckland and Kaitai, both on 24 degrees. As you can see, the sun's just about to pop over those clouds in the back there, so it's not actually that, it's not cold out. It's actually, I've got the shirt on, and it's breezy. It's like a nice warm breeze, so the showers haven't come yet. Highs of 24 and Funganui, 27 degrees. It's still possibly balmy out there. William, thank you very much. We'll hear back to you in Manaco a little bit later on. Barmy's a good word, isn't it? It is, isn't it? Barmy. It's positively barmian. Warm and inviting. Right, it's 24 away from 7 o'clock now. The government is under fire after revelations our top health officials declared MIQ should be scrapped back in November. The advice said the system was no longer justifiable, but it was three and a half months before the government shut it down. This advice has only just been reported because the health ministry refused to release it until its hand was forced. Tens of thousands of desperate Kiwis have been impacted by the brutal lottery system that was MIQ. Take a look. I miss my brother's wedding, like all of those moments you can't get those ones back. It's like you disowned. You've got no hope. It's just heartbreaking from my family and I. Heartbroken to say the least, really. I had to do my chemo alone. I couldn't have anyone in my house because of COVID. And I just need that support from my family. I need to do my chemo alone. I couldn't have anyone in my house because of COVID. And I just need that support from my family. I need to see my family. It was just in case anyone had forgotten what MIQ was like for some people. Here to respond to it this morning. We are grateful to have the COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hibkins. Minister, good morning. Good morning. Thanks for coming on the show. Why was this document kept secret? I'm not sure that's a Ministry of Health Internal document. The advice to the government that that informed came to us about a week later and made the announcement the day after we received the formal advice from the Ministry of Health. Quite a lot happened at that time, of course. So we made that announcement in late November that we would be removing MIQ for people coming into the country. About two days later, the World Health Organization designated Omicron is a variant of concern. And then after monitoring that for several weeks just before Christmas, we actually announced that we were delaying the reopening and the removal of MIQ so that we could get our booster rates up. So the suggestion that we did nothing for the several months between when this memo was first written and when the border finally reopened isn't actually correct. Things changed during that time. Omicron changed the game. Now, the decision to delay the reopening and to delay the removal of MIQ saved probably hundreds, if not thousands of New Zealanders' lives. If we had dealt with an Omicron peak before Christmas, as many other countries around the world were doing, more people would have died because we wouldn't have had the high rates of vaccination and the high rates of boosters, hundreds or thousands. Their elderly population that we ultimately achieved. Okay. So you've saved hundreds or thousands of lives by doing this. Can we come back to the question, why was it kept secret? It's advice that was given to your office, it was in your office, and it's been asked for repeatedly. Why would you not, if you're open, honest and transparent and all of the reasons you've just given, why would you not give it to the journalists? I don't think that was my decision. I think ultimately it would have been the Ministry of Health. It was their document not mine. But you could have released it. I'm happy to go back and have a look at why that was. I don't think there was any great conspiracy to keep the information private there. As I indicated, the advice that actually came to the government came a week later, and we released the decisions from that day after we got the advice. You never released this, did you, Minister? So you're telling me that you didn't know that the Ministry was withholding this information from journalists? We get hundreds of OIA requests on a regular basis. It's a simple question. Was your office told that this information was being withheld from journalists? Look, I couldn't answer that. Like I said, we get a lot of information requests, and I don't personally review every single one of them. Okay, so it's very possible that your office was aware this was being kept secret. Let's talk about some of those issues that you have raised. Some of the issues about your justifications for keeping MIQ, which remember you said was human misery, you agreed with that sentiment for some people, you said you wouldn't keep it a day longer than you needed to, right? And here you have your top health officials. You've got Dr. Ashley Bloomfield, you've got Caroline McElnay saying it's no longer needed. It's no longer justifiable and we can start moving away from it. Why didn't you do it quicksmart? Well, that particular memo wasn't addressed to me. It was a memo to Dr Bloomfield. He did share that advice with me the day after he received it. We had a conversation that day that he received that advice where we asked for some more advice, which we got within a week. Did you not trust? We made the decision within a week and announced it the very next day. Yes, but I just want to pull you up on that because the borders didn't open for months later. So why not? Because the advice that we got a week later, once it had been peer reviewed, had changed. And that advice was to be a little more cautious. So make sure that we were staging the border reopening, which is the plan that we set out a week later was designed to do. Why did you need to peer review your top public health officials? On this document, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the Director General of the Ministry of Health, Marie Roberts, Deputy Director General, System Strategy and Policy, Bridget White, Deputy Chief Executive COVID-19 Health and Response, Dr Caroline McElnay, Director of Public Health. How many public health officials, your top public health officials, do you need, to tell you something before you listen? Well, this is, you know, without doubt, one of the biggest COVID-19 decisions that we have made was to close the border and then to reopen it again. And it's a decision that you only get to make once. So we asked for some extra advice on that. Okay, that's interesting. We did that very quickly. So when you... And then we made the decision. Okay, that's interesting. So when you closed the border for the first time, did you do the same thing? There was a different... Look, I wasn't the minister at the time. You were in cabinet. You were in cabinet. You were in cabinet. Did you ask for outside advice when you close the border and cost the economy billions of dollars? There was a huge amount of advice coming into government. Independent? But the reality is, you know, the reason we were cautious here is when you reopen the border, you only get to do it once. The next time the World Health Organization designate a variant of concern, the reality is we won't have that choice of saying let's delay it to coming into New Zealand, which we could do with with DOHROMCORN. So we were very careful in making this decision because it's a decision that's not easily reversed. Agreed, but you could have sat there forever twiddling your thumbs and thinking, well, the next variant could be around the corner. The fact is at the time you got this advice, you didn't know Omicron was coming. Well, and the timeline is very clear. We didn't wait. We made the decision within a week of that memo being circulated and announced that the next day. The decision that subsequently came after the World Health Organization designated the new variant of concern, which was only two days after that to delay the border reopening, was still the right decision to make. And in fact, you'll find many of the people who were criticising the decision in November, subsequently endorsed the decision to delay the border reopening because of Omicron. And New Zealand is overall much better off because we did that. Yeah, but you can't say we saved all these lives we did the right thing because hindsight's a good thing. Look, we were very clear at the time, and we made this announcement of reconnecting New Zealanders. I think I'll give you the exact date. It was on the 24th of November. We made the decision around the timetable to reopen, and we were very clear at the time that that was a staged reopening, that it would start in January, and that would continue from there. In doing that, we knew that we were giving ourselves more time to make sure we got our vaccination rates up. And we were in public about that at the time. And also, we did say at the time that the timetable was designed that if a new variant emerged in that time, we would be able to do something about it. Here's what you said at the time. This was the 17th November at a press conference with alongside the Prime Minister Jacinda Adirn, where you spoke about cumulative risk. And this is important because remember in this document that was given to the Director-General on the 12th of November and then to you a week later, it said the risk posed by international arrivals transmitting COVID-19 is no longer higher than the domestic transmission risk of COVID-19. It also says that 90% of us were vaccinated with first dose, 81% had their second by this point. And it also said that the positive case numbers were between 0.2 and 0.3% of returnees before November 1st and that the system could handle them. This was you on November the 17th. But one of the things that we have to consider is cumulative risk. So even if we are dealing with 100 to 200 cases in the community in New Zealand today, the changes that we make at the border could significantly increase the number of people travelling across the border and even therefore if the positivity ratio stays about the same, so even if we're getting even 10 cases per thousand, if we're having 5 or 6,000 people per day coming into the country, that's another 50 or 60 cases potentially coming into the country and so we have to make sure that we're ready for that. Where did you get cumulative risk from? Well, look, that's absolutely correct. And that was, in fact, part of the discussion that came with the subsequent advice a week later when the government actually received. So you were talking about advice you hadn't received yet? In the context that we were dealing with at the time, not today's context. Now, today, when we're dealing with thousands of new cases a day, we're in a very different position then. We were dealing with still a relatively small number. It was in the early hundreds at the time, and potentially we would have been introducing hundreds of new cases across the border at that time. And so it was quite different to now. Now, the risk is absolutely different now. The whole thing is changed. New Zealand has COVID-19 circulating in the community. It was not circulating in the community in the widespread scale that it is now back when we were making these decisions. Well, there were 1,300 people with COVID or who were close contacts with COVID who were isolating at home on the 10th of November. And on that day, there was no one at the border with COVID, because everyone was double-vaxed and negative test. Well, and there would have been a couple of hundred people at the border that day. We're now getting 4,000 people across the border on the daily basis, and that number grows every day. Who are testing negative? Most are. But again, that's a reflection of the fact that the world's position has changed since then. Omicrom was right at its growth peak at the particular time that this was happening. You know, the world was experiencing a significant resurgence in COVID-19 cases. As the world has seen that that position has changed now, vaccination rates are higher around the rest of the world. Pre-departure testing is the system that we've put in place there is working very smoothly. So you can't consider any one thing in isolation. This was one particular piece of advice. The advice had already changed by the time the government made a decision a week later. Yes, because you went and got different advice, which we now know. But just before you go, Minister, I do want to ask just one final question. All said and done, you know, given what you knew, given what you know now, given what the pain and the misery, and we've heard about the 80% of people who went through MIQ, who said they suffer from mental health issues as a result, depression, anxiety. Do you want to say sorry? Well, first of all, it wasn't a question of getting different advice. The advice in the memo that you were talking about was internal Ministry of Health Advice that was assessing only the public health risk. It didn't provide guidance or advice on what we should do about that. And that advice arrived a week later. And that advice was a week later. And that advice was quite clear that we shouldn't move immediately, that we should have a staged reopening, which was what we announced the day after that. I have acknowledged all the way along in every public statement that I've made about MIQ that it has had a huge toll for many people who have been affected by it. The delay that we made just before Christmas, I acknowledged too, took away some certainty that people had been really looking forward to. They'd been making their plans, and then they had to delay those by another couple of months, and I acknowledge that that had a huge cost on people, particularly at that time of year. None of the decisions that we've made around the border have been made lightly. And in fact, what you see through the chain of written advice that we've received on this is that we did sweat those decisions. And we did make sure that we were making very robust decisions here. All right, Minister, we have to leave it there. We're running out of time. But we thank you very much for your time this morning. The COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hickens, at 11 away from 7. The document actually does address what should be done about it. It says we propose to develop policy options for implementing a shift and managed isolation and quarantine settings. We'll have more on this soon. And after the break, we hear the latest from across the ditch as election tensions escalate in Australia. And then remember Charlotte Ballas, the independent journalist who was trying to get back from Afghanistan to have her baby. Will we get her take on revelations that behind the scenes, public health advice, was that MIQ was unnecessary. This Anzac Day, trans-Tasman Titans clash.

Welcome back, everyone. This is AM and you're looking at cloudy Wellington this morning. Heading for a high of 21 degrees. Currently, it's taking 17 minutes from Island Bay into the city, 20 minutes into the city from 9-9. Traffic updates, rather this morning, brought to you by Battery Zone, your local battery expert. Australia has voiced its concerns about the Solomon Island signing a security pact with China. Its fared China will use the deal to increase its military presence in the Pacific. AM Australia correspondent Jason Morrison joins us now. Jason, it sounds like this deal is signed and sealed now. What's been the reaction there? It does. Late last night night the news came through, the deal had been done, not really in news because we knew it was sort of simmering along and has been for so long. This is shocking for Australia and this is a major diplomatic failure that we have allowed it to get to this level and have allowed China the crack to get in. And they can spit it however they like and we're in the middle of an election campaign so they will. But this is a failing of this government and it's a failing probably at the last 10 to 15 years of diplomatic administrations in this country to have allowed this on our doorstep in the region. And this affects New Zealand as well. I mean, China is getting ever so closer to our region with strategic intent. And if we want to spin it any way we want to, that is the truth of it. And to let this happen in a nation that really we should be doing all we possibly can to assist, and it appears we haven't at its time of need, and that's given someone else the shake to get in there. That's madness. And, you know, I have a feeling we'll be talking about this in 10 years' time about one of the big turning points of our region and it's happening right now and it's happening today. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardun also calling this gravely concerning. Is it going to have an impact on the election campaign? It sounds like at the moment it's just a whole lot of mudslinging. Look, it should. I mean, these are things you have federal governments for. If you think about it, national security is the number one. And the irony of a federal election campaign is that is what we probably won't be talking about. It'll be everything but that. And you're right. Elections have turned into really a character assassination game of both sides. I guess the problem that if you want the Labor Party, the opposition party looks at, even though they're miles ahead of the polls, they're up against someone who is great on the attack. If there's one thing Prime Minister Scott Morrison is brilliant at, and that's electioneering. I've known this bloke for 20 plus years, and I can tell you I have known him to be great in this domain. This is his thing, winning elections or being involved in the strategy of them and you're up against a guy who is the leader of the opposition who really that's not his thing. I mean if you've followed it at all with any general interest in Australian politics, you'll notice that he stumbled and bumble his way, the opposition leader through the last week and a half. you'll notice that he stumbled and bummed his way, the opposition leader, through the last week and a half. He went up against a guy who has a perfect approach to things when it comes to the campaign, and that'll be the game, and that's what we're seeing. But, you know, you ask me the question, is this going to be the issue in the campaign? It damn well should be, and it should be for the sake of the future of the country. But looking like it's not. AM Australia correspondent, Jason Morrison. Thanks very much for your time this morning. Those debates are going to be very, very exciting up, we'll look forward to those.

Coming up, the government took more than three months to scrap MIQ after being told it was no longer justified. The delay impacted tens of thousands of Kiwis, including journalist Charlotte Bellis, who was heavily pregnant at the time. She is with us in 10 minutes. The inflation monster is knocking at the door. Does the man tasked with tackling it need a bit of help? At 720, former Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash, an A&Z economist Finn Robinson debate. We also discuss concerns about an increase in mortgagee sales because of higher interest rates. We'll be joined by a property investor on this at 740. And later we head to Singapore, where the Prime Minister is drumming up business. We'll talk to our senior political reporter Amelia Wade at 10 past 8. Right now, time for news. Morena, good morning. It's two minutes past seven. The government is downplaying health advice from November that state had managed isolation for returning Kiwis could have been scrapped sooner. It took the ombudsman's involvement for the documents to be released after initial requests were turned down at the time. Minister Chris Hickens believes the advice wasn't final, and the Ministry of Health holds some responsibility for the delay. It was their document, not mine. I'm happy to go back and have a look at why that was. I don't think there was any great conspiracy to keep the information private there. As I indicated, the advice that actually came to the government came a week later, and we released the decisions from that the day after we got the advice. Nearly 230,000 people have been through MIQ since March 2020. Meanwhile, the National Party leader says he isn't surprised health officials found that MIQ wasn't justified and expects the government to make an apology. The risk isn't actually at the border anymore. There was actually very few people coming through that were in MIQ that were actually COVID positive at the time. And we were calling for it, I think, through a petition at the time as well, saying we've got to end this because there wasn't really a plan and there really wasn't any justification for MIQ. The Maritime Union is calling for regulations for port works similar to those in other industries. It comes after Estabodora's believed to have fallen to their death at the ports of Auckland on Tuesday. It's the fourth death involving the port or its operations in recent years. Maritime Union National Secretary Craig Harrison told AM there are no regulations for overworking. But what we haven't got is regulations that are enforceable under law. So if you can compare us, for instance, with the trucking industry where you have hours of work, licensing. So we need that sort of level of control brought into it, which is a pretty dangerous industry. Harrison is calling for the government to lead an inquiry into port safety. Hawks Bay Motorists are being advised to expect delays on Pocafai Road after an accident near the Chesterhope Bridge. A car towing a trailer crashed and brought down power lines around five this morning. The road will be closed for at least an hour. Motorists will need to take alternative routes. A controversial security pact between China and the Solomon Islands has been signed. The road will be closed for at least an hour. Motorists will need to take alternative routes. A controversial security pact between China and the Solomon Islands has been signed. China's foreign ministries confirmed that the two countries have agreed on the deal, which would pave the way for a Chinese naval base to be developed in the Pacific. The issue of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region is being discussed during the Prime Minister's trip to Singapore and Japan. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry says the deal will help maintain social order and safety in the island nation. Russian forces are making ground in Ukraine's eastern territories as the bloody battle for Donbass region continues. The East has been hit by more than 1,200 missile strikes in the last 24 hours. Ukrainian authorities say the city of Kremlinia has been taken and are now urging residents of Luhansk and Donetsk to evacuate. Meanwhile, the port city of Maripol is under continued fire with civilians trapped there calling the invasion a living nightmare. My youngest can't stop crying. He twitches in his sleep. He and the oldest one are starting to get depression. They miss a peaceful life. It's been really frightening lately. Frightening even to go out of the bunker to use the toilet. President Vladimir Zelensky says no matter how many Russian troops are brought in, Ukraine will not give up without a fight. In sport, Manchester United and Liverpool fans will lead a minute's applause as a tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo and his family. Ronaldo and partner Georgina Rodriguez announced on Tuesday that one of their newborn twins had passed away. In a statement, United says that family is more important than everything and Ronaldo is supporting his loved ones at this immensely difficult time. The applause will be held in the seventh minute to honour the football superstar who's missed the match to be with his family. The new boss of the New Zealand Olympic Committee hasn't ruled out making a bid to host the Commonwealth Games. This year's Birmingham Games will be Nikki Nicholl's first event in charge of the NSOC. She admits there's lots that needs to fall into place but says New Zealand could be in a position to host a major event in the future. It is expensive to run major events such as Commonwealth and Olympic Games and so we've got to find that right formula that brings the social and economic objectives as well as the sporting objectives and so having the opportunity to do it across the country would be something we'd love. That's the very latest for News Hub. It is six minutes past seven. Thank you very much, Bernardine. Lots of your feedback this morning on the issue of MIQ's and, you know, the lottery of misery, as some have termed it, which we will get to a little later in the programme, but we do have a lot to get through this morning. So we are going to our weather update now with William. Good morning, William. Morena, I'm coming at you from the beautiful botanical gardens. Never been here before. I'm on debut. And check out this beautiful sculpture here. Done by Fred Graham. He's 94 years young and he's still kicking around and giving it his absolute best. Yeah, we're at the beautiful botanical gardens, but let's check out the weather around the Motu. Tomorrow's weather brought to you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. There are some heavy rain matches across the country this morning to be aware of. Orange heavy rain morning in Tasman, western and fjoletland regions with high rainfall expected along with thunderstorms and large amounts of surface water. Heavy rain matches in Canterbury and Otago regions, also in Bola and Westland regions. Expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms. Now to the rest of your weather. A cloudy day in the lower south with showers developing in the afternoon. Ote Poti-dened in 20 degrees in Oumaru, a high of 18. To the west coast, heavy rain periods with light nor easterlies developing in the afternoon. Peel-Pahel-Tahee, Milford Sound, 19 degrees and Hokitika, 20. In Canabria, Mulbra, expects some morning cloud and evening cloud with possible showers in the afternoon. Tautauai Christchurch on 23 degrees, Te Waiharakeke, Glenham, a high of 24. Some morning cloud in the lower north, with north-easterly winds developing throughout. To Fanganui atara, Wellington, 21 degrees, and Faka Oriori, Marsden, a high of 25. Now to the central plateau, you can expect cloudy periods and showers developing later in the day. Taupor 20 degrees in Fanganui, a high of 27. To the east coast, expect high cloud coverage coupled with nor-easterly breezes and scattered showers. Tauranga 22 degrees in Rotorua, a high of 19. And to the top of Altearo, expect cloud coverage and some possible heavy showers in the morning. Expected to ease by the afternoon, though, Damaki Makota, Auckland and Kaua, both with a high of 24 degrees. We're going to be catching up with manager of the beautiful botanical gardens, Jack Hobbs, in about half a niles time. So don't go anywhere. He's going to tell us some great stuff. No, we're looking forward to it. We'll go and find you in the bush. William, thank you very much for that. It's just gone nine minutes after seven. We'll be back with William. Half-past. Now, the government is under fire for delaying a decision to scrap its controversial MIQ system. It comes after revelations that it received top health advice in November that MIQ was no longer justifiable. It wasn't until three months later that MIQ for returning Kiwis was ended. In the meantime, of course, tens of thousands of Kiwis were impacted and one of those Kiwis was journalist Charlotte Bellis who was pregnant, stuck in Afghanistan and had a very public battle to be allowed to return home. Charlotte joins us now live from Christchurch. Charlotte, first of all, welcome home, finally, and how are you doing? Good, good, yeah. We've only got a couple of weeks to go. We're due mid-May, so it can't down as well and truly on. And has your partner, he's a Belgium national, has he been able to return to New Zealand to be with you? Yeah, so we came in with MIQ in early March, and he was allowed as long as he was with me. So we both came in then, and MIQ was actually scrapped while we were in MIQ. So since then we've just been renovating a little house in Christchurch and settling in and preparing for a baby to come. Right. So you had battled for so long to get a spot in MIQ. You come back and while you're there, MIQ is scrapped. And now we find out that in November, the public health advice was actually that MIQ was no longer necessary. What is your view on the battle that you had to go through to now find out that that was the advice behind the scenes? It's really hard to wrap your head around because we've been, I guess, in the nitty-gritty of it for so long. And also at that time, I mean, I was trying to think back when I was reading this last night about how the health advice was mid-November. And then the government did actually announce that the phased reopening, I think it was from end of February for Kiwis, around that time. And at that time, we thought, okay, because we'd been playing the lottery to try to get back. We thought, okay, great. If it's going to be phase reopening from February, that's fine. We don't even need to do MIQ. New Zealand's going to open up and we'll just come back, and that's still the stuff's time to get back for the baby. So, yeah, I remember that time quite vividly as thinking, what a relief that they're going to scrap it. And then, of course, they closed it again. So, you know, it's hard. I've only read what has come out overnight, but I don't know what else was going on behind the scenes in terms of the phase reopening for February and then how they decided to rescind that again. There was so much confusion around that time of, you know, for people trying to make plans, and of course all the Kiwis that got stuck in Australia as well with, we'll open up, we won't open up up and what that meant for people abroad. Yeah, and this of course was before Christmas so there would have been a lot of people wanting to return home for various reasons. For yourself, had the borders open, had MIQ been scrapped around November instead of the delay and for three months later, what did that delay cost you? And I'm not talking about money, but in terms of the emotional and for three months later, what did that delay cost you? And I'm not talking about money, but in terms of the emotional toll on you. Yeah, I mean, I get emotional thinking about it now. It was a lot. Yeah, just the roller coaster of it and thinking, okay, we can come home. Actually, no, we can't come home and what do we do? And then the emotional toll in terms of when we thought, okay, we need to fight this, it's not right. And it's not logical anymore. Like if you've got Kiwis who are positive in New Zealand, who can just go home and self-isolate, but you've got Kiwis abroad who are testing negative and not even allowed to get on a plane, the logic of it, it just wasn't fit for purpose anymore. And when we said, okay, well, why don't we tell our story? And then at least there'll be a public debate about it. But we paid a huge, huge price for that. Because not only were you criticized by some people for using your platform to speak out, but you ended up in a war of words with the COVID-19 minister. True, yeah. I think, yeah, and there was a lot of misinformation, a lot of things that came out that weren't correct. And also, you know, a lot of people, and unless you were in the MIQ system, unless you're a Kiwi abroad, you think a million people, unless you had kind of played the lottery yourself and tried to get home or been one of those people who needed an emergency spot, it was very hard to understand the mechanics of it and what was involved on a paperwork level. And what the, I guess the response and the tone of the response was like from the MIQ officials or the health ministry or the government itself as to, you know, we were treated very much like the enemy and vilified often. Do you feel that your owed compensation or owes an apology? It's, yeah, I don't really want to comment about that specifically. I think that there's so many Hewis of Raw. Yes, I think there just needs to be some understanding of, when I came back and after I thought about it and how it was always, you know, the team of 5 million in New Zealand. And I thought, God, it would have made such a difference to say, you know, we're a team of 6 million, actually. There's a million Kiwis abroad. And yes, 5 million did an amazing job in New Zealand to keep everyone safe, but so did a million Kiwis overseas who sacrificed so much because they thought, you know what, I will sacrifice coming home and having those freedoms and being out here on my own because I had my job. And other pregnant women like the South would have not been able to come back and into MIQ over that time too. Yeah. But I mean, a lot of people sacrificed a lot and it was overseas specifically. And it was never really appreciated, I think, by the government. And we actually were all a team together. It's just we didn't happen to be in the country and we were trying to do our part. So probably hard for you to talk about yourself, but do you think those Kiwis erode an apology? I think there's been very little from the government in terms of there's been the occasional and thanks for the Kiwis abroad as opposed to, you know what you guys did a hell of a lot. So some acknowledgement. Independent Kiwi journalist Charlotte Bellas, thank you very much for joining us this morning and best of luck with the birth of your baby girl very soon. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. She's very heavily pregnant and she's good to go. 17 minutes after 7 now, it's interesting listening to Charlotte's very heavily pregnant, and she's good to go. 17 minutes after seven now, it's interesting listening to Charlotte, isn't it? Because there was this massive divide between the Kiwis that were here, and we're seeing emails from them now, who said, keep those borders closed. I don't want those. And there were really disgusting words used. I don't want those Kiwis who are infected and, you know, filled with Delta coming near my house. We've done so well here in New Zealand. And it was a real them and us, a real separation. The same thing happened with the vaccines, you know, with the mandates and it got, you know, and whatever for your reasons, blah, blah, blah. But there was this ugly division in New Zealand. And I think when Charlotte was talking, I think everyone in the room, camera guys in everyone was thinking, yeah, that's right. Man, that was ugly, wasn't it? So let's move on from that. But it may take some healing, as we just heard. 18 after 7 now. Up next. Inflation, inflation, inflation. We're all feeling it. It's going to get worse. We've got a panel to discuss it next. Tonight on three, it's parental guidance before an extreme version of Tugger War on all-new S-A-S-A-S Australia.

It's tipped to reach record levels when the official data is released tomorrow, confirming many of our fares. It comes as Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr admits the bank isn't in a good place and suggests a changed approach to government spending, government spending the world over. For more on this, former Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash and A&Z economist Finn Robinson. Good morning. Good morning. Great to have you both on the show. Love a good panel on inflation. Don, we'll start with you. Adrian Orr speaking to all governments about fiscal spending and about being clear with their communication. What's he saying? Well, he is saying something that governors have said for a long time monetary policy needs mates. And if fiscal policy is very stimulatory, as it has been in New Zealand, as it is in the United States, monetary policy has to work harder. And that means interest rates will be higher than they otherwise would be. So this is the Reserve Bank Governor shifting the interest rate lever and Grant Robertson, the one who can spend all the cash, the fiscal side of things. That's right. They need to work as a team. Yeah. And Adrian is saying, I'm going to have to increase that official cash rate more because of the extent of government spending stimulus. Yeah. Finn, this is something that the government hasn't really wanted to acknowledge or in an overt way. But this is pretty clear. Do you think that Adrian Orr is talking to our government, or as Grant Robertson has suggested, more generally to all governments? Well, I think, I don't put words in his mouth, but I think that fiscal stimulus around the world has been really strong, and that has led economies to be a lot stronger than expected going into the pandemic. But now, with economies being overheated like that, I think they're very much thinking, well, maybe now is the time where you start to think about, well, where's the best spending to happen? And, you know, Adrian, or the governor's clearly worried about how inflationary the economy is right now. So I think he's thinking, well, maybe there's time to spend money more wisely, or at least target it where you can, which is something you can't do with monetary policy, but you can with fiscal. Right. Don, you've always been an advocate of spending money more wisely. And the budget is coming up. So that's what we're talking about here, isn't it? Yes, that's right. And I mean, New Zealand and the US. The US is in a similar situation. US has had very aggressive fiscal policy. New Zealand's had very aggressive fiscal policy. And as a consequence, our inflation rate, as in the US, is much higher than, for example, in Australia or Singapore, Japan. Other countries have much lower inflation despite the international factors which affect all of us than we do. Because we spent more during the pandemic. We have. And of course initially that was entirely appropriate. No one doubts that we had to have a lot of fiscal and monetary stimulus when the pandemic first broke. The challenge now is to wind that back in a way which doesn't put so much pressure on monetary policy. Finn, do you agree with that? We're amongst the highest spenders in the world during the pandemic and now, and are we feeling that in our pockets? Well, we were particularly a high spending with the wage subsidy, for example, but we got pretty good bang for buck with that because we kept employment relationships intact we didn't see as significant as significant of an increase in unemployment as we would have otherwise and I think now what you're just saying is the result of what's been a pretty successful policy response is that now the economy is a lot more a lot stronger than we expected and so now yeah basically you need to think about well how do you how do you control that inflation pulse without derailing the economic recovery? Because you can't have your cake and eat it too, can you? I mean, you can't stop going to work, you know, shut down factories, etc. And then take on debt, lots of debt, to pay the bills and expect there will be no consequence of that. No such thing as a free lunch. That's right. Okay, so what do we do now? What does the government do now, do you think? Finn, what's the solution? Or the Reserve Bank? Well, for the Reserve Bank, the policy response is pretty clear, which is they need to keep on raising interest rates. You know, they've had the foot on the accelerator for the last couple of years with super low interest rates and buying assets. And now for them, they need to take the foot off the accelerator and possibly squeeze the brakes, at least until inflation starts to slow down. And it's difficult for the government because on the one hand, the economy is overheating. Inflation is really strong. We think it will print at 7.4% tomorrow. But at the same time, there are people who are really struggling. So there are sectors around the country who, for example, tourism. You've spent two years without your peak international tourism season. So there's a balance there where you've got to think about where are we spending the money best. And perhaps early on in the pandemic the answer was just to get the money out wherever you could. And now it's sort of more targeted spending would probably be the best approach. And I think that's certainly what's on their radar. Don, would you agree with that? And where should we target? Well, I'm not going to be precise on that point, but Finn's right. There does need to be more targeted government spending. I mean, more targeting of government spending. We don't need more government spending. On the contrary, we should wind that back a bit. How much? Well, I'm not going to put a number on it. But clearly, what Adrian is saying, the government is saying, the more government spends, the harder my task will be, which means the high interest rates will be, the higher mortgage rates will be. So one way or the other, we have to cool this economy down. You can either do it by cutting back on government spending or you can do it by cranking out monetary policy. And in fact, in the moment, both are needed. Adrianne or saying, my lever is working, but it's hurting people, so you need to help me with yours. Well, he's saying if you don't, mortgage rates will be even higher than otherwise. And we don't want that, do we? Not people with the mortgage, anyway. Thank you both so much for your time this morning. We really appreciate you both being in the studio. It is 27 after 7. That's former Reserve Bank Governor, Dr Don Brash, and also Finn Robinson, the ANZ economist, with us this morning. It is coming up to Huff Pass. News next.

A fresh wave of MIQ criticism is flying the government's way from tens of thousands of Kiwis. Official documents released on Tuesday state, managed isolation for returning Kiwis could have been scrapped in November, advice the government was slow to act on. For Kiwi journalist Charlotte Bellas, who was pregnant in Afghanistan at the time, the revelation brings back tough memories. I get emotional things about it now. Just the roller coaster of it and thinking, okay, we can come home. Actually, no, we can't come home and what do we do? But COVID-19 response minister, Chris Hibkins, told AM the advice wasn't final, saying that the Ministry of Health should take some of the blame for the delay in its release. Apologies, no audio on that. Police are concerned poor weather could hamper the search for a missing fishermen off the east coast near Apotheki. An assessment of the conditions will be undertaken this morning to decide if police, coast guard and the Air Force should resume their efforts for a fourth day. Members of the public are still being asked to keep an eye on for items of interest, including a white chili bin, wooden oars and a yellow life jacket along the shore between Toreri and Makatu. A concerning security pact between China and Solomon Islands has been signed off. China's foreign ministries confirmed the two countries have agreed on the deal which could pave the way for a Chinese naval base in the Pacific. A spokesperson for the foreign ministry says the deal will help maintain social order and safety in the island nation. Approved by the governments of China and Solomon Islands on behalf of both governments, we have formally signed a framework agreement on security cooperation. The issue of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region is being discussed during Prime Minister, Jacinda Adirn's trip to Singapore and Japan. Boris Johnson has been met with jeers and booze in his first appearance before the British Parliament since being fined for breaking lockdown rules. The Prime Minister has issued his second apology and asked the country for forgiveness, following the infringement notice he received for attending an illegal function at Downing Street. He claims that he was unaware that a gathering in the Cabinet room, just before a meeting on COVID strategy, was in breach of the rules. Despite this, he says there was no excuse for his behaviour. I take this opportunity on the first available sitting day to repeat my whole-hearted apology to the house. As soon as I received the notice, I acknowledge the hurt and the anger. Johnson acknowledges that the British people deserve better from their prime minister. Actor Johnny Depp has taken the stand in his $50 million defamation trial against his ex-wife, Amber Hurd. The lawsuit follows an opinion piece, Hurd wrote for the Washington Post in which she called herself a victim of domestic violence. Tep denies any abuse and says the words are categorically untrue. They were not based in any species of truth. It was a complete shock that it would, it just didn't need to go in that direction. Hurd's team has until this point portrayed Depp as an abusive partner prone to drug and alcohol binges. In sport, Liverpool has made the perfect start to their Premier League encounter with arch-rivals Manchester United, taking a 2-0 lead inside the first half.

The Highlanders are looking forward to the chance to reset this season as the New Zealand side's head across the Tasman for the first time this weekend. Super Rugby Pacific is heading to Melbourne with the magic round seeing all sides play at Army Park or Amy Park this weekend. Highlanders, they face a tough task taking on the top-ranked Australian side of the Brumbies. But Kiwi Prob, Ethan DeGroot, is excited for the challenge. We've been building nicely. We just need to pull it together for 80 and there's a lot of things out there we're missing opportunities-wise and we're not pulling trigger but I suppose it is a bit of a reset for us to hook in and play the Aussies. Yeah, they'll still be hurting from their one point loss in the dying minutes to the canes. Good luck to and that's the very latest from News. It is 24 to 8. Thanks very much, Bernardine. People are actually really divided on whether MIQ should have been scrapped back in November, which was when this memo was released from the Director of Public Health, Dr Caroline McElnay, to the Ministry of Health. Ellen has written in saying, well, would you have preferred to have Omicron in the country or MIQ? I support the government on their decision. And Kirstie says they did the right thing to look after Kiwis that live in New Zealand permanently before others overseas. The timing of what happened after this report is also quite important because we're saying this morning, why weren't these experts' advice just followed to the letter? But in fairness fairness this document does actually point to further work needing to be done saying that although the rate of positive cases coming into the country through the border was only at 0.2 or 0.3% if you open the borders that would be different you've got letting a whole lot more people in. So it does say that further modelling is required. And it says that the borders should be looked at being closed within the first quarter of, sorry, opened in the first quarter of 2022, which is what has happened. Yeah, but months later, right? I think that the thing here is that at the time, and you'll remember this, because the frustrating thing for Kiwis at the time was that, especially those in Auckland who were in lockdown, was that there was no clarity. There didn't seem to be a clear plan of what was going to happen. And yet they kept telling us that there was a master plan, there was a grand plan, and to just be patient and to just wait, and when the time was ready, it would all be implemented. What this clearly, I think, demonstrates is, is it a government that was obfuscating and was, you know, malicious in trying to keep MIQ in place? I don't think so. But what this shows is that there was no clear and ready plan to get us out of EMIQ. But if that's the case, what's wrong with saying there's no plan? We're investigating. Well, this government's always had a problem with admitting that it perhaps doesn't know at times what it's doing. Feedback. Am I right or am I right? I mean, they did it with the borders. They did it with the testing at the borders. They did it with the vaccine rollout. I mean, if you don't know something, just say you don't know. I think we'd be all right with that, right? It's a worldwide pandemic. Who knows what's around the corner? Yeah. Let's go around the corner, though, to William at the Botanic Gardens. A beautiful spot in Tamakimakato, William. Atomari, good morning Yes, you can really feel the Wairo here How beautiful is it?

Mate, 45 years you've been here before the botanic gardens started. What did it look like out there? Well, out there, there were cattle, there were sheep. It was divine. There weren't very many visitors, of course, because we weren't officially open, but it was a farm. Wow. Mate, what are the special things about the botanic gardens? What's so special? Well, I think we've got beautiful gardens. We've got something for everyone. We've got wonderful art, such as our beloved butterfly right here. It's a nice of the start, son. She's got there. She has. Very elegant. Yeah, beautiful. And, of course, people can come here. They can select the plants. They want to grow at home because we don't spray our plants, no insecticide, no fungicide. So what you see here is what you get. And of course, they're labelled. So you can go to the garden centre and you can buy what you want. Wow, it's amazing. There'll be people at home that are massive garden enthusiasts. What can you pass on? What's knowledge can you give them? Autumn's here. So what are some flavors you can give them at home? Well, okay. So autumn is the best time to plant most things. Anything that is not frost tender, now is the time to put it in the ground. So if it's a tree or a shrub, it'll establish over the winter, you know, nice moist soils, and it'll be established by next spring. But also now is the time to plant your veggies. So get all your cool, you know, cool-loving veggies like your cabbages and your lettuces and all that kind of thing into the garden right now and your annuals, poppies, pansies, that type of thing. So perfect time to plant. Oh, beautiful, mate. And you look super young, mate. So it's obviously quite therapeutic and, you know, I was just saying I could really feel the witerwa around here. So it must make you young, mate. You're looking bloody awesome. Thank you for the time. Cheers, Lord. The amazing manager, Jack Hobbs there of the Botanic Gardens. Great moment. Brilliant, William. Thank you. And if you're young, mate, you're looking bloody awesome. Thank you for the time. Cheers, Lord. The amazing manager, Jack Hobbs there of the Botanic Gardens. Brilliant, William. Thank you.

On this day, 252 years ago, Lieutenant James Cook claimed the eastern portion of Australia, naming it New South Wales. On this day in 1951, a Romanian surgeon replaced a human organ for the first time using a section of the stomach to bypass the esophagus. 12 years ago today the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing 11 people and causing the largest accidental marine oil spill in history. And on this day 36 years ago, Michael Jordan landed a record 63 points in an NBA playoff game, a record that still stands today. That was this day in history for the 20th of April. Thank you for watching. It is 11 minutes away from 8 o'clock now. There are concerns that mortgagee sales are set to spike as higher interest rates put pressure on household budgets, but also developers' backpockets too. So what are the early signs that are causing worries? Joining us now is the Auckland Property Investors Association's former president, David Whitburn. David, good morning. Good morning, Ryan. Let's start with developments, because mortgagee sales generally are actually okay. It's never okay, but okay at the moment, though we are looking at the interest rate hikes with an eye of worry. But there's been a couple of developments in Auckland. There's the Pamura development, Sunny Nook Central Development, of 15 townhouses that was put up for mortgage auction in March. Do you expect, as costs start to increase for developers, that we might see more of these mortgage sales? Absolutely. I mean, the data from CoreLogic in the last quarter showed just six single figures for mortgagee sales. However, the writing's starting to become on the wall. Now, there are more pressures. We have a cost of living crisis, and developers are not immune to this. Been facing unprecedented challenges in procuring construction labour with tight immigration settings, construction materials, making sure that we can get resource consents quickly and building consents quickly enough and then concerns that lenders are having in relation to the strength of pre-sales. So as the quarters and months roll on, I think we are going to see, unfortunately, more developers, I guess, hit the wall. So if you are looking to buy a property, maybe your first property in a development, should you be a little worried about a developer's ability to deliver? With an experienced developers, that would be something that's an issue. There are numerous developers, including extremely well-heeled developers that have got a track record of performance that have never failed. And this can be through many cycles, including a much tougher time through 2008 to 2010. And that shouldn't cause a big cause of a concern. But there are some developers with shaky track records that are out there and some new developers that haven't experienced anything other than a property market boom. So when the chips are down and when the tide's going up, they get caught a little bit short. But I don't think that most first-time owners and indeed investors that are now moving into new builds should be that worried yet. But it is something to watch as these interest rates start to buy it. What are some of the signs that you look for and a good developer versus somebody who may fall prey to a situation, the perfect storm as it's being described, that we find ourselves in now? Absolutely. There's no substitute for a proven track record experience. Getting runs on the board. They're often just a simple search of Google. You can go and find out a bit about a developer and what's there. It's only if they're hiding behind accountants using blind trusts or some curious structures like that, that would cause some good reason for concealment. But there's also no substitute for some good legal advice. That's to make sure that the development agreements, the pre-sale agreements aren't two one-sided and a fair and balance. But the main one is track record. Is there any requirement, any legal obligation for a developer to run their numbers on a project before they go and start pre-selling sections or whatever it might be townhouses to the public? There's actually no legal requirement to do that. However, it does come down to common sense, but it's also controlled by lending. If you're not going to run your numbers, you're highly unlikely to qualify for finance because the lender has a lot of money vested in it, and they may make a bad decision, which could hurt the developer quite badly. There is some criticism that's leveled at some developers that sell developments when they do not have a resource consent in place. And that's something that I do appreciate has been lobbied to various governments of different colours and persuasions. So that's something that may need to change as time goes on if there are increased numbers of developments failing. Oh, that's interesting. So you can sell a development without having a resource consent for the development yet? That's right. Yes, you can. Interesting. All right. Hey, thank you very much for your time this morning. We've really enjoyed talking to you. Auckland Property Investors Association, former president, David Whitburn, with us at six minutes away from 8 o'clock.

What's Until next moment Oh my mom and welcome and welcome back thanks for joining us without my little channel girl we've got and welcome back thanks for joining us on AM this morning My little channel grew up in the morning. Horky, Mayano, and welcome back. Thanks for joining us on AM this morning. We're looking at Auckland today. You're heading for a high of 24 gusty northeasterlies, taking 28 minutes into the city from Browns Bay and 38 from Half Moon Bay. Traffic updates, thanks to our partner, Battery Zone, your local battery experts to-day. And that means it's time now to check in with our reporters in Auckland. Tia, we've been speaking a lot here on AM about ram raids and you've got the latest figures. The ram raids happening across Auckland, the number is getting really high, but the age of the people committing the crime is actually really low. Police data revealed 88 percent of people committing ram raids are under the age of 20. Most are actually under the age of 17s. They are children. Suburbs like Tamaki are experiencing ram raids almost every day in liquor stores and dairies are often the number one target. Police advice to the likes of liquor stores and dairies is to, if you can, install bollards in the front of your store to prevent cars from driving in. And thanks very much. Tia, let's go to Christchurch with Mitch. Mitch Redman. There are some special tours around the city. Yeah, good morning, Mel. Next weekend, the Open Christchurch architectural festival is taking place which will allow cantabs to get-close and exclusive look at some of the city's sites. And no doubt top of the list will be a tour around the Christchurch Cathedral, which for the best part of 11 years has been off-limits entirely for the public. Unfortunately, nobody will be allowed inside the cathedral. Not even the workers have managed to get in there yet, but it will be a chance to go beyond the barrier, which has been blocking the view of the cathedral. Not even the workers have managed to get in there yet, but it will be a chance to go beyond the barrier, which has been blocking the view of the cathedral since those quakes. Now, the tour will be led by those working on the project, which will no doubt offer plenty of information on just how much work is required to get the cathedral back open by 2027. But to anybody keen to go and have a look next weekend, head to open Christchurch, sorry, open ch 2027. But to anybody came to go and have a look next weekend, head to Open Christchurch, sorry, open chicha.nz, where you can register and no doubt those spots will fill up pretty quickly. Wonderful. Mitch, thank you very much and thank you to you, Tia, our AM reporters around the country. All right, it has just gone 8 o'clock and this is AM. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It is Wednesday the 20th of April. This is AM just ahead. We cross to Singapore. We're going to get the latest on the PM's Offensive there in her first international trip since the pandemic. Right now. We're both saying the same thing. They say it's good when you finish each other's sentences, but not speak at the same time. Let's read it at the same time. Three, two, one. Time for the news. Team effort. Atomario, good morning. It's one minute past eight. A fresh wave of MIQ criticism is flying the government's way from tens of thousands of Kiwis. Official documents released on Tuesday, state managed isolation for returning Kiwis could have been scrapped in November. Advice the government was slow to act on. For Kiwi journalist Charlotte Bellis, who was pregnant in Afghanistan at the time, the revelation brings back tough memories. I get emotional things about it now. Just the roller coaster of it and thinking, okay, we can come home. Actually, you know, we can't come home and what do we do? COVID-19 response minister Chris Hickens told AM the advice wasn't final and that the Ministry of Health should take some of the blame for the delay in its release. It was their document not mine. I'm happy to go back and have a look at why that was. I don't think there was any great conspiracy to keep the information private there. As I indicated, the advice that actually came to the government came a week later and we released the decisions from that the day after we got the advice. The Maritime Union says a lack of safety standards and regulations is contributing to a high rate of accidents and deaths at our ports. It comes after, as Steve Adore is believed to have fallen to their death at the ports of Auckland on Tuesday. It's the fourth death involving the port or its operations in recent years. Maritime Union National Secretary Craig Harrison told AM an investigation is required to make sure workers are kept safe. Unheard of for workers to work up to 70 hours in a seven-day period. So it requires that level of investigation to pull back and maybe a national standard or some codes of practice that are enforceable to rein it back into where it is. Harrison is calling for the government to lead an inquiry into port safety. Regular ferry commuters from Auckland's Gulf Harbour will have to take the bus today as trips are cancelled due to the weather. Winds of up to 30 kilometres an hour are expected to hit the shoreline where the ferry dogs making it too dangerous to operate. Inflation is expected to have another sharp increase when the official figures are released tomorrow. Former Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash says higher interest rates and tighter government spending are required to bring inflation under control. One way or the other we have to cool this economy down. You can either do it by cutting back on government spending or you can do it by cranking out monetary policy. And in fact, in the moment, both are needed. The United States is accusing Russia of pulling troops out of Syria to fight its war in Ukraine. Ukraine's eastern territories have been hit by more than 1,200 missile strikes in the last 24 hours. Authorities say the city of Kremlin has been taken and are now urging residents of Luhansk and Donetsk to evacuate. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby says U.S. intelligence indicates Russia is throwing everything it has at its second wave of warfare. We know that the Russians have tried to recruit foreign fighters, particularly out of Syria. The Russians themselves said they were going to recruit 16,000 Syrians. We don't know whether they actually achieved that goal or how close they got to it and how many foreign fighters there might be in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Greece has seized a Russian oil tanker off the island of Evia as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. In sport, Liverpool are on their way to the top of the Premier League table after dominating the first half of their clash against Man United, taking a 2-0 lead at the break. It took the hosts just five minutes to get themselves on the score sheet with the Reds cutting United's defence open with ease as Louise Diaz converted from close range. Liverpool then doubled their lead through Mohammed Salat who took a brilliant pass on his stride before slotting the ball home. Despite their rocky form, the Wellington Phoenix are confident of finishing the season on a high to reach the A-League finals. The next have two wins from their last five games and have the worst defensive record in the competition. However, striker Joshua Saterios looking at the positives with a clash against Western Sydney at Eden Park on Sunday. We're already in good spirits. We have good mentality going into the Wonders in Auckland. And yeah, we're a team that keeps believing and we never give up. That's the mentality that Ufi and the coaches-off have been stored into us. Former Kiwi's half to Mighty Martins set for a remarkable return to the NRL after a brain bleed forced him to retire two years ago. Martin has previously had stints at the Panthers and Cowboys playing in the 2017 grand final for North Queensland. In 2019 it was discovered he had a small bleed on his brain, forcing him to end his career early. After getting the all clear from the donkey, he played for Wycotele in last year's NPC before being snapped up by the Brisbane Broncos. He's been named at fullback for their game against the Bulldogs on Friday night. That's the very latest for Newsap. It is six past eight. Thanks very much, Bernardine. Have you heard about this woman in the US? Her name is Taylor Humphrey. And she makes a living out of recommending baby names to parents. Yes, I've heard about this one. $1,500. It starts at. It goes up to $10,000. And you may ask, what on earth is she doing? Well, she does give a very detailed questionnaire to parents and she goes back and looks at genealogical records and tries to find old names. But that's a lot of money. It's a lot of money, but I suppose it's something you want to get right, isn't it? I mean, you don't want to... There are lots of names that we won't say that if you add them to the wrong last name can be embarrassing for a child. That's what Google's for. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out first names and last names don't always go. What are we paying Babs Humphrey? What was she getting $1,500? Well, she even has been paid by one mother for convincing her to keep a name. So the little girl's name was Eila and the mother was concerned that people would mispronounce it. So this Taylor Humphrey was compensated for convincing the mother to keep the name. What, to call the kid June? Because there was no confusion over that. That's ridiculous. Yeah, that is ridiculous. But we want to ask you this morning, because we'd love your feedback. Have you ever changed your baby's name? Feedback at amshow.co.n.z. Have you ever had a change of heart? Feedback at amshow.co.com. And changed change your child's name. Be it officially or otherwise. We'd love to hear from you and we'd love to know why this morning. I'll buy you a B. What, Brian? Well, don't do that to me. Okay. Because there is a big difference, isn't there, between a Brian. There you go. And a Ryan. Do you know what I mean? You've never thought of change in your name.

We have some placeholders. Before I officially change it, I just want to be short. I love it. I don't love it. What did she change it to? Why do they always do this? Blame it on Chloe.

William Edward is quite different from Swifty and Xavier, isn't it? William, thank you very much.

This is AM. Great to have your company. The Prime Minister is turning on the Kiwi Razzle-Dazzle in Singapore for her first overseas visit since the pandemic started. So how is the charm offensive going? Joining us now with the latest is senior political reporter Amelia Wade. Amelia, thank you very much for joining us live from Singapore. I know you haven't had a chance to speak with the Prime Minister yet about the MIQ revelation this morning, but how much do you think that is going to overshadow talks with her today? Yeah, we won't get that chance to ask the Prime Minister about that delayed advice and sort of the justification for keeping MIQ in place longer than those public health experts wanted. So we'll get to ask her about it this afternoon. I'm sure it will be raised in that press conference, but there is a really big sort of program here, and the big focus of that today is sustainable aviation. She'll be out at the port. She's going to the airport as well to make those big announcements. So while there will be questions about that domestically, internationally, the focus here really is on sort of climate change. You know, yesterday we saw at the joint press conference that Prime Minister Lee and Jacinda Ardurn added sort of climate change. You know, yesterday we saw at the joint press conference that Prime Minister Lee and Jacinda Ardern added sort of what they're calling a fifth pillar to their partnership. And that is about the rebuilding back from COVID with a climate focus and a green economy. So that is really going to be the sort of international focus of today. And I'm sure the Prime Minister will be happy for it to be the focus for her today. I want to ask you as a senior political reporter for News Hub, you're obviously sitting in a lot of those post-cabinet press conferences and one o'clock briefings. So do you remember back in November what was said about public health advice at the time and whether it was the case that they said MIQ could be dropped or whether it was that they were saying that it needed still to be a transition into a new setting, a new traffic light setting? Yeah, there were certainly a lot of questions asked by us, even at NewsHub, about sort of what the justification was for MIQ when we were seeing so many domestic cases of Delta, especially in that Auckland boundary. I think the timing of this is really interesting. So that memo was dated the 12th of November. And then on the 24th of November the government released its massive sort of reconnecting New Zealand plan. But you'll also remember then at that time the Auckland boundary was in place and that was the real focus for the government to try get that lifted. So that was going to be the first phase in that reconnecting plan to lift the boundary and then a month later open up our borders to the Australians, to people coming from Australia sort of a month later in January. I think it seems like the feeling was there that they wanted to sort of test the waters to see what it was like to sort of unleash, I guess if you will, sort of the Auckland Delta outbreak, which it had been holding back with that border, and then see what the impact of that was across New Zealand over that summer before reopening in January. But you'll also remember back in that time, sort of when the emergence of Omicron came, the government almost reverse engineered the argument to keep MIQ in place, saying, you know, it was exactly this reason that we did keep MIQ in place longer, but there were similarly questions at that time, especially about sort of why people couldn't return to Auckland and then maybe stay there before heading out to the rest of New Zealand. So Omicron arrived and it was a kind of hindsight decision. You covered MIQ extensively, so no doubt we will hear more from you on the senior political reporter Amelia Wade. Thanks for joining us live from Singapore this morning. Hope you're enjoying the heap, Amelia. Oh, it's so humid there, isn't it? It's muggy in Singapore, absolutely. Interesting, the word there, reverse engineered. You know, I think that's a bit of that going on. Hey, very quickly, just one of your emails. And Lucy's saying, hurry up, Brian. Get on with it. This is from Kim. She says, fantastic show, as always. I used to want the name Sol for if I had a son. Some pronounce it's Saul, some pronounce it's soul. Anyway, soul is what the name she wanted. Until a friend helpfully pointed out, what? So when the kid goes to school, he'll get called ass. Soul? Asshole. Assal. Yeah, it got taken off the list. Have a great day, everyone. Pam says her dad changed his name, was meant to be called Salborn Hamilton Croft. He's now Jock Croft. There you go. 21 minutes after eight more of these soon. After the break, our panel is here.

League legend, Sir Graham Lowe, and mental health advocate, Jazz Thornton, with us this morning. Good morning. Good morning. I see you've got comfortable shoes on. Yeah, look, I'm going straight from here to dancing, so I'm wearing my sneakers with my dress. So jazz is on dancing with the stars. It's going to be one of the big stars of the show. You're going to win it, aren't you? Oh, oh, look, I hope so, but there are very, very talented people on this year, so who knows? People always say it's a lot of work. How many hours are you doing? Yesterday I did 12, but that's because we had like a big group rehearsal at night as well, but we're doing like at minimum five hours a day every day. And how's it going for you, Graham? The dancing. Oh, I'm going real good. The dancing. Are you much of a dancer? No, no. I think I am, but my son's a brilliant dancer. One of my twin boys, he's 18. He's a brilliant dancer. But if I could be a fraction as good as he can, I'd be over the moon. He's actually going to be on the show. Yeah, he's in the opening part of it. So, you know, we're really, really proud and looking forward to it. And I know how, you know, the commitment and conditioning and practice these dances do is just, it's insane. Jack used to dance, practice five days a week, three hours a time, five days a week. Wow. It's just insane. Jess, how are you finding that? Yeah, I'm covered in bruises. You can see the ones on my leg, so I'm very tired. It is super fun, though, so I think, like, it makes it a little bit easier that you're looking forward to every day, but it is absolutely exhausting. I don't think I've had so many, like, massages all the time. I'm just going out and, like, booking myself, because my body is just like, oh. And, yeah, but it is super, super fun. Have you seen the other competitors had a sneak peek and know who's kind of, you know, the ones to try and beat? Oh, I mean, our studio is really fun in that we have like little show and tells. So we just like show each other our dancers and everyone is doing really well. I train a lot with Brody Kane and she's bossing it. She's going to hate me for saying that but she is bossing it. Eric Murray one to watch, I will say that. But I think everyone, everyone I'm like oh flip, it's going to be a hard competition. But you're lucky because you're dancing with Brad and he's just brilliant, isn't you? He is. He's very hard on me but he's very, very good and has got me spinning around and doing all things that I didn't know I could do. Well, we've been left spinning a little bit this morning after these revelations about the MIQ system, right, with the Ministry of Health coming out in November saying, we don't, it's not necessary anymore. Now, obviously, in hindsight, probably a good thing we had it. But at the time, I mean, the government was standing by it and those people were really suffering, you know, dying loved ones and whatnot. What do you think about it, Lowy? You were just listening to what's happened this morning. If you were on the other side of it and you were one of the people trying to get in it, it's just heartbreaking. You can't imagine what it would be like. But, you know, I think to me, I think we've only seen a little bit of what was made available or what the recommendations were. So I don't I can't see a government completely misleading the public over something. I mean, they're dead ducks if they've done that. But I just think there might be a little bit more involved than what's actually been released. Would it be nice if they released more stuff, you know, as they're going, so we can kind of see why they're doing things? They're politicians at the end of the day. You know, they hold the baby in one hand and take the lollipop out with the other. So that's just what they do. That's a great analogy, isn't it? Jess, do you think we should have known that this advice was out there, or is it fair enough to keep it at an official level? I feel like it, I think knowing probably would have made it harder. I did MIQ in January, and it was rough. I had a health thing happen when I was in the States and had to come back and was very, very lucky to have been able to come back. But I think hearing the stories of everyone trying to get in, if you knew that actually it might not have been the case, you already had people that were trying to kind of get out of the system by catching flights. So I think Fiji or something and then trying to come back and then just refusing to leave. And so I think the knowledge of that without the context of actually why maybe would have caused more outrage and people trying to fluke the system maybe. But as someone who was in MIQ, it was not the best time. I documented on TikTok and millions of people watching my food. But I was in a room with no aircon, the window didn't open, and it's not good for your mental health. So if it actually could have stopped in November, then, you know, but hey, we're here now. We're kind of moved on, haven't you? We're just like, forget about this horrible period. Let's just dance. Just dance, dance away. Hey, thank you both so much for coming on the show. Good to see you as always. We'll get your tap shoes on next time. Yes. Hey, League legend, Sir Graham Lowe and mental health advocate, Jazz Thornton, this morning. It's time now for the news. Morning, good morning, it's 831. The government's downplaying health advice from November that stated, managed isolation for returning Kiwis could have been scrapped sooner. It took involvement from the ombudsman for the documents to be released after initial requests were turned down at the time. Minister Chris Hedkins believes the advice wasn't final, and the Ministry of Health holds some responsibility for the delay. It was their document, not mine. I'm happy to go back and have a look at why that was. I don't think there was any great conspiracy to keep the information private there. As I indicated, the advice that actually came to the government came a week later, and we released the decisions from that the day after we got the advice. Nearly 230,000 people have been through MIQ since March 2020. Meanwhile, the National Party leader says he isn't surprised health officials found that MIQ wasn't justified and expects the government to make an apology. The risk isn't actually at the border anymore. There was actually very few people coming through that were in MIQ that were actually COVID positive at the time. And we were calling for it, I think, through a petition at the time as well, saying we've got to end this. Because there wasn't really a plan and there really wasn't any justification for MIQ. Police are concerned poor weather could hamper the search for missing fishermen off the east coast near Apotheki. An assessment of the conditions will be undertaken this morning to decide if police, Coast Guard and the Air Force should resume their efforts for a fourth day. Members of the public are still being asked to keep an eye out for items of interest including a white chili bin, wooden oars and a yellow life jacket along the shore between Toreri and Makatu. A concerning security pact between China and the Solomon Islands has been signed. China's Foreign Ministry has confirmed that the two countries have agreed on the deal, which could pave the way for a Chinese naval base to be developed in the Pacific. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry says the deal will help maintain social order and safety in the island nation. The issue of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region is being discussed during Prime Minister Jacinda Adern's trip to Singapore and Japan. Well, we did discuss developments in the Pacific region and particularly China's growing interests in the region. We are not familiar with the details of the agreement, so we're not able to comment upon that. A person is dead after police fired on protesters in Sri Lanka amid historic protests. Police fired live ammunition in an attempt to disperse the protesters killing one. Sri Lanka is facing one of its worst ever economic downturns that has seen prolonged par cuts and food shortages. They're now seeking financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund. Protesters say there's nothing left to do, but take to the streets. We can't make ends meet. We have no electricity. We don't have gas. The price of rice has skyrocketed. We can't make ends meat. So we have no choice. We took to the streets to throw this government out. Authorities have conceded that fuel, power, food and medicines have been running low for weeks, asking the public for patience. In sport, Liverpool are close to climbing back to the top of the Premier League table as they lead arch-rivals, Manchester United 3-0. Luis Diaz fired the home side ahead before Mohamed Salah ended his gold round for the Reds with a brilliant strike. Sadio Manet then put the game to bed for the hosts who hold a three-gold advantage with less than 20 minutes to play. Hurricanes winger Julian Severe is hopeful of an all-black's recall but admits there's still a lot that needs to happen before he dons the jersey again. The 31-year-old has been one of the Kane's top players this season, cementing himself as a key starter in the side. While he'd welcome the chance to run out again for the All Black Severe isn't getting ahead of himself in the race to earn a spot in Ian Foster squad. 100%. That's definitely something in my head anyway, but I've been saying that, like, there's still a long way to go. I know the talent among the A-Bs there is quite huge. Tyson Fury has reaffirmed his desire to retire after he faces mandatory challenger, Dillen White, at Wembley Stadium. At a public workout, the heavyweight box confirmed that this weekend's bout would be his last fight and he'll finally hang up the gloves. Fury's opponent White was no show at their training with the 34-year-old reportedly still at his base in Portugal. Harry Stiles fans, listen up. He's coming back to Altiero. Oh, there is a Chicello with her show. They'll hit to Auckland's Mountsmart Stadium next year in March. It's part of a stadium tour with stops in Australia as well as hear tickets go on sale next Wednesday. That is the very latest from News Hub it's 25 to 9. We should go. Team bonding. Ben, I was just going to say, do you reckon? You'll be up for it. Oh yeah. Ryan would be up in the Mosh pit? Yeah, I would be. If you were keen, I'd be keen. Do you know I really miss this Shania Twain? Yes. Wasn't she great? She was. Does she have a house here? Was it Shania Twain or one of the other? Is it Queensland? He was down in Wonika, I think it was. Yeah. Gorgeous and talented, like the package. Hey, imagine. Sorry. Imagine if she, because she has a house here, if she showed up at Harry's concert. That would be because she did in Coachella, and we're talking about that a little bit later on. Has anyone seen Shania Twain? We could go and stay at her place. Before the... Before the concerts. That would be good team bonding, wouldn't it? Team bonding, team bonding. We'd get a little number. We could be a little his warm-up act. We could be the Coachella of Mount Smart Stadium. Yeah, I don't think we'd be as excited. People won't be as excited if we just walk on the stage. I'm afraid. Great idea. Maybe William, though. William, they'd be excited if you walked on the stage at Harry's concert, I'm sure you'd do a bit of a backup dance for him. William, you feel like a woman? Man, I feel like a woman. They wouldn't be excited whatsoever, but we did go to Coachella back in 2019, me and Taylor, and it's an amazing event. And when I saw Nads or Nadia Lim, she lives just under where Shania Twain's area is down there in Queenstown. So when I went there for lunch, she said, this is all Shania Twain's area. And we met on Dancing with the Stars as well, me and Nat. So I heard Jazz was there. She's ready to go. So she's going to make a lot of friends doing that. It's going to be awesome. Yeah, forgot about the you and the dancing, well, I mean, I shouldn't forget because you dance for us most days. But I forgot you were on the show. Any advice, any advice for them? Oh, have heaps of fun and express yourself. And yeah, that's what I would say. Have heaps of fun. Get out there and, yeah, have fun. That was the main thing for me. It was grueling, like jazz was just saying. It was really gruelinging but just have fun is the best smile heaps and enjoy enjoy the moments that you're on there and like you've got to you've got to yeah absolutely all right we're the time yeah well guys check it out we're in the we're in the we're in the botanic gardens and i'm in the children's area as we speak and this is Maui, the mythical maze of Maui right here. So I've got a quick story to tell you. Maui, he turned into a keridu, hit up in a tree because he thought his mother was up to no good. So he hit up in a tree looking down and he saw his mother kiss another man and the man, he threw a purridi berry at the gentleman and then the gentleman threw it back up to him in the tree, and he fell out of the tree and transformed, formed back into Maui, and then he noticed that it was actually his father, so he was wrong in that instance. So that's a good little story for you guys to just think about that. Don't go snooping around, because you're probably long. Let's head to the weather around the Motu. Tomorrow's weather brought to you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. There are some heavy rain watches across the country this morning to be aware of. Orange, heavy rainwater in Tasman, Western and Fioland regions, with high rainfall expected along with thunderstorms and large amounts of surface water. Heavy rain watches in Canterbury and Otago regions, also in Bullen, western regions, expect periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms. Now to the rest of your weather. A cloudy day in the lower south with showers developing in the afternoon. Orte-Boti-Danid in 20 degrees and Oamaru, a high of 18. To the west coast, heavy rain in periods with light nor easterlies developing in the afternoon, Ote-Poti-Denide in 20 degrees in Oamaru, a high of 18. To the west coast, heavy rain in periods with light, North Easterly is developing in the afternoon. Peopoeia, Milford-Saur, 19 degrees and Hokitika, 20. In Canabria, Mowbra, expects some morning and evening cloud with possible showers in the afternoon. To Otautahi Christchurch on 23 degrees, Te'wai-Harake-Belem, a high of 24. So morning cloud in the lower north, with no easterly winds developing throughout, Te Fangunui-Atara-Walington, 21 degrees, and Faka Orii, mastered in a high of 25. Now to the central plateau, you can expect cloudy periods and showers developing later in the day. Taupo 20 degrees in Fungaui, a high of 27. Wow! To the East Coast, expect high cloud coverage coupled with northeasterly breezes and scattered showers, Tauranga 22 degrees and Rotorua, a high of 19. And to the top of our beautiful country, Altearoa, expect cloud coverage with some possible heavy showers in the morning, expected to ease by the afternoon, Damaki Makoto, Auckland and Kaitaya, both with a high of 24. You guys, check out the jungle. We're still in the children's go. We move from Maui to the jungle now, and this is just awesome play area for kids. Like, we are in the school holidays. Let's get the devices out of the children's hands. Get out there and walk, well-being walks. What about that? Get a picnic. Hey William, just watch out. Just look above you, above that jungle sign. Oh. There's a wee monkey there. A little monkey there. It's got its eye on you. William, thanks very much. Yeah, I can see that actually. It's a very cool part of the Botanic Gardens, that Children's Garden. Head there if you're looking for something to do over the school holidays. Oh, you've been there and seen it. Because I was thinking, wow, you've got good eyes. Well, I saw it there too. Come on time he's picking out my kids. I was too busy reading some emails, which we'll read a couple of now. This is from people who've changed their kids' names, changed their baby's names, as the Kardashians have apparently done. And lots of people have done it. We've had loads and loads of people say that they've changed their baby's names. Jane says, yes, it took six weeks to name our son. We called him Theo, and I still have Theo on his doctor's notes during his way in, but on the sixth week, we changed his name to Barton. Six weeks is quite a long time to get to get used to a name. I reckon it would be kind of weird to change halfway through. You know you never change a horse midstream. This is from Ray Ray says my daughter was to be called Constance with a backup name of Megan right up to the time of her entering the world it was Constance, Constance, it was constantly constant and then at the very moment she literally emerged from Mum, from the womb that very second we both said, Megan. How weird. There was something about her right in that moment that screamed Megan, probably literally screamed to Megan. And it was Jesus himself, who anointed her Megan. Thank you so much for sending in your feedback. It's 18 minutes to nine and after the break and increase in the official cash rate has seen interest rates follow suit.

We are looking at pictures of Nelson where there's a heavy rain warning for the region from 8pm tonight. Traffic is all flowing freely in the area, taking 12 minutes into the city from the airport. Traffic updates the thanks to our partner battery zone, your local battery experts. Well, the cost of living interest rates and the official cash rate are all obviously on people's minds at the moment. So how can Kiwis deal with these increases to adapt and deal with the property market? Here to tell us more is our property apprentice founder and CFO Debbie Robbins. Debbie, good morning. Good morning. All right. So what should we be doing if we are looking to get into the property market? We're seeing everything go up. You know, most economists predicting the OCR, for example, will peak at three to three and a half by 2024. What should we do to plan for this stuff? Yeah, a lot of economists have actually predicted but now it's going to increase to that peak earlier than 2024. Like some of the economists over the last couple of days have come out and said that we could reach that peak before the end of this year. So, you know, that's a bit horrifying when you see how quickly interest rates are increasing. Now, something interesting to note is that the interest rate and savings accounts don't seem to be increasing at the same rate as mortgage interest rates. So I think the people that will get hit hardest by this will be the people who already have a mortgage that's coming up for renewal over the next 12 months because they will have got used to paying their mortgage at a lower interest rate. And so it'll be quite a shock to come off like a 2% or 2.5% interest rate and having to refix at 5.5% or 6%. Yeah, absolutely. So people in that position should obviously get some advice about how to go about doing that. Yeah, absolutely. And there's lots of things that a mortgage advisor can help you with. So talk to an independent mortgage advisor because they can help you work out. If you've got savings, for example, then you might be able to have an offset account to help you pay off your mortgage faster before the interest rates increase. It might be worth you while to break your interest rate that you've got and refix for a longer period, albeit at a higher interest rate, and it might actually still work in favour. So, you know, mortgage advisors can crunch all those numbers for you and give you some really good guidance. I think something else that's really worth considering is instead of having your entire mortgage on one fixed interest rate, you can split it up to spread your risk. You know, so have part of it expiring in 12 months, part of it expiring in two years, mobile part expiring in three years, just for example. Okay, so your mortgage advisor can look at your overall position and discuss all of those different options with you and find one that suits you best. I mean, at the end of the day, most people will cut back on their spending in order to continue to pay their mortgage. You know, that's human. We all need a roof over our heads, right? But with the inflation, the way that it is, it is going to be tough for a lot of people. So, you know, talk to your mortgage advisor sooner rather than later. Don't leave it until you're struggling to pay your mortgage. Get on top of it sooner rather than later because potentially you might even be able to switch to an interest-only mortgage for a period of time. Yeah, it's interesting you're talking about, you know, because it does seem like a drastic measure to pay the fee and get out and pay it off. And then, you know, it does sound like a drastic move. But as you say, in the long run, it could actually be cheaper for you. Debbie, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We really appreciate it as always.

It is five minutes from nine. Trans-Tasman Travel is back on, and that means our Kiwi Musos are back in business. Some of New Zealand's best acts have jumped right across the ditch, performing in front of thousands. And to give us the rundown is holiday records, co-founder Ben Wallace. Ben, good morning, and it's a very good morning for our Kiwi Musos over in Australia and all of the expats who are going to go and get to see them. But do you expect locals will go and see them? Will it kind of grow their audience? I think, without a doubt the way we can listen to music is so widely spread now that Australian markets are a massive for New Zealand and that I think it's almost a phoma they haven't been exposed to it in so long that they'll be seating to go to gigs just like we are back here. And here is a clip of 660 performing in Brisbane over the weekend showing that indeed people are getting out. Awesome. It would just be so good to be able to see them there, especially for those Kiwi fans who haven't been able to have a taste of New Zealand for quite some time. Streaming is obviously quite important in terms of revenue, but is concerts really where they're making money? Absolutely. I mean, streaming's actually not that great for a lot of artists. I mean, 0.1% it's really good. But live gigs are where it's at, especially because they get merch stalls, vinyl record sales and stuff go up with that too. So it's a massive, massive part. And it's really good for punters because it means bands have to tour, which means there's loads of concerts as well. And, of course, one of the biggest concerts in the world right now is Coachella, with a bit of a surprise for Harry Stiles fans. Yeah, it was, yeah, joined by Shania Twain. I mean, there's always surprise acts and things that pop up at Coachella, but that was one of the more surprising things from the weekend for sure. Let's have a look at it. And of course, Harry Stiles announcing this morning that he will also be heading to New Zealand for a concert later this year, which will get lots of people very excited. But he performs again at Coachella this weekend, right? It's so popular they have to break it up over two weekends. Yeah, that's right. They always split it over two weekends. So it's the same line-up as well. I think it's just the sheer volume of people wanting to go. But I'm not sure you see Shina Tewain twice. I think they's just a sheer volume of people wanting to go. But I'm not sure you see Shania Twain twice. I think they change up their surprise act, so who knows what's in store for the weekend tours. Do you think there will be a surprise? Oh, for sure. I mean, these, like the Harry Stiles, can pull in anyone at any time. True, true. Okay, well, we'll have to look out for that one. Holiday Records co-founder Ben, thanks for your time this morning. Kind of funny that maybe he did it on purpose tonight, Twain, because he, you know, he's, what is he's gender fluid or something, or he wears women's clothing, and she sings the song, Man, I Feel Like a Woman. Ah, I don't know what was the link. Did not think that deep. You know how he wears dresses and stuff to the awards? It's Gryffindor. I love his style. I love what he wears. I love a man who can rock sequins, nail polish, and still be manly as well. He's just rocking the whole vibe. I love it. Get your husband in that, one of those sequins numbers. Fill your boats. I would wear it, though. It was pretty cool. Now, what is the official line on whether you stop a horse midstream or stop a horse mid-race? Well, the thing is you had... Horses were crossing streams before they were racing, weren't they? From an 1864 speech by Abraham Lincoln in reply to a delegation from Delaware, an old Dutch farmer once remarked to a companion that it was not best to swap horses when crossing streams. So the saying is, don't swap a horse midstream, not don't swap a horse mid-race. Now you all know. You're welcome. And there you go. Thanks very much for joining us on AM this morning. We're back, of course, with AM early with Fern from 5.30 tomorrow. See tomorrow."}
