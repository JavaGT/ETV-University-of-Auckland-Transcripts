How Auckland University is defending their right to study. Ki-a, good evening. TVNZ is launching an independent review of its recruitment policies after the sudden resignation of its new breakfast host, Kamal Santa Maria. The state broadcaster's decision follows allegations of misconduct by Santa Maria against a female colleague. Nicole Bremner is across developments and joins us now live. Kiyora, Nicole, what else is TVNZ saying? Yes, Kiyota, Simon. Well, TVNZ's chief executive, Simon Power, declined to our interview request, but this afternoon released a statement outlining the independent review. It will look at all the company's recruitment processes and comes just three days after the resignation of Kamal Santomerea amid allegations of misconduct. The former Al Jazeera presenter had been at TVNZ for just over a month. What other details do we know about the review, Nicole? Well, Mr Powell said he believes recruitment policy had not been followed or applied consistently and that a senior employment lawyer Margaret Robbins will conduct the review and recommendations will be shared with staff once the review is fully completed. We also sought comment today from Broadcasting Minister Chris Farfoy. He wasn't available this afternoon, but he told media this morning that robust employment processes at TVNZ is a good safeguard. A tricky time for staff, Nicole, lots of questions from outside and from within the newsroom. Yes, Simon, you know, it's been a really difficult time investigating and reporting something so close to all of us in the newsroom. But we are continuing to investigate the story. We are continuing to work hard on it because it's really important that we get to the bottom of what's happened here. Mr Power has told staff this afternoon that the company takes any questionable behavior extremely seriously, and it's their number one priority to support people who come forward. That said, he also said many lessons have been learned at TVNZ over the past few days. In Tamaki Makoto, Nicole Bremner, thank you. It's a Pacific pushback against China's plans to influence security in the region. Beijing is still brokering economic deals on its multi-island tour, but they're short of the far-reaching pact feared by the West. China's high-level delegation is tonight in Tonga. Our Pacific correspondent Barbara Dreva reports. China's island hopping around the Pacific getting the royal treatment in Tonga. Our Pacific correspondent Barbara Draver reports. China's island hopping around the Pacific getting the royal treatment in Tonga. Beijing hoping this day brings better luck after failing to secure the region's endorsement of its controversial plan to get heavily involved in Pacific Affairs from security to fisheries. Of course, there are some concerns on some specific issues. And we have agreed that these two documents we will be discussed afterwards. While the welcome is warm, China is unlikely to get Tonga's agreement on security matters. In an exclusive interview with One News, its foreign minister made the kingdom's position clear. It won't act alone when regional issues are at stake. The main issue here is that if a security agreement has an impact wider than your national interest, you know, it impacts the region, then maybe, you know, that issue should be discussed. That's likely to have been the foreign minister's stance at yesterday's a virtual meeting between China and Pacific foreign ministers. If the People's Republic of China came to Tonga and said, we'd like to do this security deal, we can provide you support. Military, police, whatever, would you sign it? It would really depend on what the situation is in Tonga and what our needs. So careful assessment of those needs would have to be taken. Tonga has its own defence force and, like Fiji, fiercely guards its independence. Despite signing some agreements with China, Fiji is no walkover. Last year, it gave a military and security training hub contract to Australia over China, which also tended for it. And Australia is also to fund a new Navy base there. Traditional allegiances are still strong, but the regional alliance even stronger. That's the thing we've got to remember, is that the Pacific Island Forum enables the Pacific to lead an agenda in their interests. No firm date has been set for the Pacific Leaders Forum with the region's future on the line. Barbara Dreveh, One News. And China's Pacific push will be a big focus in our Prime Minister's meetings at the White House tomorrow morning. All eyes will be on whether President Joe Biden will ask Jacinda Arden to change stance on our biggest trade partner. Here's our US correspondent Anna Burns-Franc. From stage show to world stage, this US tour has been a three-pronged attack, tourism, trade and politics. Selling our Tearoa and our produce to a massive market. Talks with top figures on key issues like climate change, and tomorrow morning, face-to-face diplomacy at the highest of all levels. There'll be a number of issues on the agenda, as you can imagine, but really top of mind for us, alongside, obviously, the war in Ukraine, is the situation in our region. That's primarily China's big Pacific push, and the US position is clear. We will remain focused on the most serious long-term challenge to the international order, and that's posed by the People's Republic of China. To counter China in the Pacific, Jacinda Ardurn says the focus needs to be long-term cash investments, but if asked too, would she take a stronger stance against Beijing? Regardless of political party or the shade of government, New Zealand has been absolutely solid on maintaining our independent foreign policy. And this global trade expert says she'll be mindful of what China gives us that America doesn't. They won't give us the FTA that we've wanted for a long time. They left TPP. They've invited us into this Indo-Pacific framework which we're participating in, but we still have to have a mind from where the wealth of New Zealand comes from, and it comes from trade globally and trade with China. And with no US free trade deal on the table, Jacinda Ardern is tempering expectations. Tomorrow is not about announceables. It's not about new initiatives. It actually is about that relationship, but I already consider it to be a strong one. Along with President Biden, Jacinda Ardern will also meet Vice President Kamala Harris, top diplomat Anthony Blinken, and Biden's Indo-Pacific envoy, Kurt Campbell, a Pacific Engagement powerhouse and a strong signal of tomorrow's primary focus. And Anna's joining us now from Washington, D.C., ahead of those White House meetings. Kiyoda, Anna, what will our Prime Minister hope to get out of that meeting with President Biden? Kiyoda, good evening, Simon. Well, first of all, this is FaceTime. Very important FaceTime after all this time. It's been eight years since a New Zealand Prime Minister's been invited to the White House, and this sort of diplomacy is invaluable. But of course, what about tangible outcomes? Well, this was a trade trip, and the Prime Minister will want to bring trade up with the US President, but it won't be that CPTPPA that the New Zealand government wants the US to rejoin. It's just not in US interest to rejoin that pact. That was the Trump administration that pulled out. Instead, the Biden administrations launched this Indo-Pacific alliance, but that doesn't actually offer us any free trade. Experts we've spoken to suggest that Jacinda Ardern should actually be asking for one quite specific thing, and that is for our steel and aluminium export tariffs to the United States to be removed. Those tariffs were imposed by the former Trump administration, but both Japan and Australia have managed to have them lifted. New Zealand might be able to do that too if Jacinda Ardurne can make a personal request of President Biden. That would, of course, be a nice win out of this meeting, but also a nice way to wrap up what was, of course, a trade-focused trip. In Washington, D.C., Anna Burns-Franc, thank you very much. Labor has launched an attack ad targeting national leader Christopher Luxon. The social media post came out last night in the wake of the One News Kantar public poll showing a dip for Labor. Here's political editor, Jessica Muchmachai. Labor's attack ad hit last night amidst a dip in the one news poll. Is Labor getting jittery around his performance? No, not at all. I think it's important as part of what we do to hold the opposition to account. We produce many, many social media posts and around the budget dozens of positive posts about what we're doing in the budget. But from time to time, we're going to raise issues and concerns about the opposition. I got no idea. I actually haven't seen them. The criticism, no new policies. Do not worry about us and our policy. We're going to be just fine. And when we go to the election in 18 months' time you'll see a complete set of policy. The Prime Minister may be overseas but her ministers got the memo echoing her response. You know, this is a really tough period. Right now, Kiwis are doing it tough. It is tough. You know, are doing it pretty tough. The latest poll numbers show we could see a hung parliament. Given that the two blocks in Parliament what we traditionally call the left block and the right block have 60 seats each, it means neither of those blocks have an absolute majority. And in the House of Representatives, to progress anything, you need an absolute majority. You've got a situation where the Greens into Party Māori are unlikely to be part of a formal coalition that includes Act. But for the right policy wins, he is also the option of confidence in supply, something we've become used to under MMP. They're all hypothetical. Polls raise questions about political futures. Will you be hanging around in politics if you lose next year? I love it, and I love all of you. It's about whether the voters love them back. Jessica Much McCai, One News. A murder trial is underway for three men accused of killing an Auckland grandmother. The Crown alleges Falala Yongi, Viliami Yongi and Manu Yongi shot her through the window of her house only weeks after two of them shot her to her son. Logan Church was at the High Court. Two brothers and their cousin, accused of taking the life of a 57-year-old woman, described as a much-loved grandmother. This case involves the most serious of allegations. The Crown says Meliame Fissi Ihoi was in her lounge in the early hours of January 15, 2020, when she heard a disturbance outside the window. As Mrs Fissie Ehoi faced out into the dark, one of those men shot her in the face with a shotgun at close range. And she died instantly. The victim's husband and children were asleep. Neighbours alerted police after hearing the gunshots and a car speeding away. Perhaps even more tragically, Mrs Fissie Ehoey wasn't even the killer's target that night. She was murdered with a bullet that was intended for her son. The prosecution says that's because her son had a falling out with two of the defendants after a deal trading a gun for methamphetamine fell over. That's led to a violent confrontation only weeks before the alleged murder. What started is a firearms deal gone wrong, escalated to a shooting, and then ultimately to murder. While we can name the accused, we can't identify them at the stage. Only one defence lawyer made an opening address. He urged the jury to be cautious. You can't just throw a blanket over them, over those three people there, and treat them as a job lot. It's expected the courts will hear from more than 80 witnesses over the next five weeks. Logan Church, One News. Two of Gloria Vale's senior leaders have quit their positions as the West Coast commune starts to implement change. In a statement, a Gloria Vale spokesman says says, fervent steadfast failed to handle employment issues during his time as the community's financial controller, while faithful pilgrim failed to protect children in his care while principal of Gloria Vail Christian school. The spokesman says the resignations were part of Gloria Vail's commitment to change. Last week, Gloria Vail apologized for failing to protect victims of labor exploitation and sexual abuse. Māori medical students say they're fed up with racist abuse from other students and the public. They say messages accuse them of unfairly gaining places in Auckland University's medical school, but the school says it needs to address the terrible inequity suffered by Māori and Pasifika in health. Isabel Prasad with this story. Growing up, Blaze Watercourt didn't see many Māori doctors which inspired her to become one. But her studies at Auckland University have been difficult because of racist abuse. People were telling me that I got in easy and that people are way smarter than me and I'm not going to be a good doctor because I don't have the grades. The comments she's received in lectures and online target her entry into the Māori and Pacifica admissions scheme. The remarks include Māori are handed everything from the taxpayer. Another describes Māori with the derogatory term Hori and says they should stay in their place. One person said just because Māori aren't as smart doesn't mean it's our fault. Yeah, it really shattered my confidence and maybe think, like, oh, do I belong here? Another Māori students had a similar experience. It'll happen every other day. It really just threw us off at the beginning, but now we've gotten used to it, which is not great. Like, I don't think we should be getting used to receiving racist comments on the daily. We put these concerns to the university. My initial reaction is disappointment, but when I hear the tone and flavour of those comments, it's more like shock and horror. We do not accept that that's a view that should be held, but we do accept that that sentiment is a result of this highly competitive selection process. But the university says getting into medical school isn't just about good grades and it's important doctors reflect the communities they serve, which is why 30% of entries are dedicated to Māori and Pacific students. There is a massive shortage. There is terrible inequity in health in New Zealand around Maori and Pacific. The new Māori Health Authority supports the university's approach. The way that the institutions have worked throughout the last 182 years is that it has favoured some parts of our community more than others. And therefore this is just kind of trying to rewrite the balance of that. While medicine students are taught about inequities, some say more education is needed. It's not as in-depth I feel as needed. It really just touches on the surface. The students hope speaking out about the abuse may lead to a change in attitudes. Isabel Prasad, one news. Surgery has been deferred at Christchurch Hospital today and more delays are expected, with occupancy at 112%. Canterbury DHB is experiencing high levels of staff sickness combined with a number of people presenting to ED so unwell they're admitted for care. It's apologised to those whose surgery will be postponed this week, but says it's the only way to continue to provide safe care where needed. This time last year, occupancy was around 90%. Another hospital has earthquake-prone buildings, this time in Bay of Plenty. Tauranga Hospital identified the four buildings through seismic testing. Sam Kelway explains the plan for them now. Tauranga Hospital has joined a growing list of quake-prone infrastructure with four of its buildings below code. They are at the heart of the hospital, and so the majority of our patients and visitors are in those particular areas. Areas include the kitchen and offices, the main ward and the theatre block. Thousands of people pass through each week, but the DHB insists it's safe. There's no risk of us needing to close Tauranga Hospital because I know people have asked me, are we going to have to close as Hurt of closed? We're not in the same situation as Hurt. So the hospital will remain open. The assessment says that they're not imminent risk of collapse or anything, but they're below the building standard. The DHB has 12 years to raise the earthquake ratings, currently below 20% to above 34%. Seismic testing at the hospital revealed one area where there was a serious safety concern. Strengthening work was completed last year to ensure it was safe for staff and contractors. We know there is a significant need across our hospital network to upgrade and renew buildings, and we're doing the best we can to make sure that we have a program of work to do that. But seismic risk is only part of the problem. We wouldn't want to invest literally hundreds of million dollars in purely seismically upgrading a building that actually we've substantially outgrown. So we're thinking very carefully and working with the Ministry of Health around a substantial investment. The preferred option to build a new clinical services block to address both seismic requirements and the growing demand for hospital care in the region. Sam Callaway, one news.

That's the finding of a report by the Productivity Commissioner looking at the impact of immigration on our economy. Corazon Miller has more. The digital world touches almost every corner of our lives, evolving so quickly, there are more jobs than the industry can fill. It's growing at about 7.5% per year, which means roughly 4,000 or 5,000 new jobs created every year. Future growth is dependent on migrants, who have skills we don't teach here. With COVID, we haven't been able to bring in the migrants, and these tech companies just have set up shops overseas and have basically shifted out of New Zealand. The pandemic highlighted our reliance in migrants across agriculture, health, hospitality and construction. New Zealand is a country, have always experienced outward flows of New Zealanders, so we need some migrants to come back and I suppose fill the gap there. New Zealand is struggling to house our growing population, but the Productivity Commission says restricting immigration is not the answer. In terms of creating jobs and in terms of wages and productivity, migrants contribute positively. The Commission's made 24 recommendations, urging the government to create a more transparent, strategic policy keeping infrastructure growth in mind. So we've got immigration policy and settings being set ad hoc without looking at the training that we're doing and looking at the core drivers of whether they're skill shortages or not. The government's recently announced a rebalancing of immigration, focusing on bringing in more high-paid workers in areas of need. We need to send the message that we're not just open for business, but we want them to come in. And part of that is some of the policy around making it easier for people. Or face losing skilled people to greener pastures elsewhere. Corazon Miller, One News. Russian forces are advancing into the largest city in the Donbass region, which is still under Ukrainian control. Several Donetsk is a key target in Russia's attempt to take control of the country's east. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen sent this report from the frontline town of Bakhmut. Life was never easy in Dombas. At least it was familiar. Now the war is getting closer to their care home. And it's time to go. This was never easy in Dombas. At least it was familiar. Now the war is getting closer to their care home. And it's time to go. These women have no families to support them. One of the Ukrainian volunteers said the Russian soldiers are worse than animals. We can't leave these women behind. They're taking them west out of Dombas, away from the Russian advance. Some powerful American-made howitzers have just arrived, but not enough to stop the Russian advance into Severinetsk. Ukraine's generals must decide how many more troops to sacrifice in what could be a losing battle for this part of Dombas. A fighting retreat to more defensible positions looks likely if the Russian offensive doesn't stall. New trench networks well back from the existing front line are ready. Kramatostk, one of the Dombast towns that must be on the Russian target list, is about 15 minutes drive that way. The rest of Ukraine is there. This might all simply be just in case a contingency plan, but if the Russians do blast their way through, they're going to need it. Maxim Lutsik's unit was ordered to retreat closer to Bahmoud after weeks of heavy fighting. He's one of thousands of Ukrainian volunteers. Putin understands only the language of bullets, blood, war crimes. The killing here has brought the big nuclear armed powers closer to confrontation than since the height of the Cold War. Millions are refugees. A wider war is a clear risk. More destruction, hunger, poverty, and more funerals are a certainty. War is the bringer of grief and change.

A recent uptick in anti-Maii sentiment is raising concern with experts. They say disinformation groups have pivoted following the anti-mandate protests to issues like co-governance. And it comes as some politicians notice a rise in online abuse, as Deputy Political Editor, Mikey Sherman explains. Placards on race issues not an uncommon sight at many protests and some of the sentiments now being spread more widely. We've been monitoring specifically a rise in anti-Mari sentiment for over a year now. But most recently in the last six weeks, there has been a significant increase. This expert says following the anti-mandate protest at Parliament, disinformation groups have shifted focus. We did expect that there would be an uptick in racism, and we have seen that. It's particularly around ideas of co-governance, around notions of heapua, the Māori Health Authority. Labor Minister Nana Maha Mahuta who has fronted a lot of these issues posted a comment she received recently calling her the N-word. We wouldn't tolerate it for our young people. I won't tolerate it. And these nameless, faceless, keep of worries should be held to account. The Minister in charge of the Māori Health Authority says he's blocked over a thousand people online. I've been called, you know, a n-h-h-hap. I have been called by our own people a coupapa and a traitor. It's not just Māori MPs, National's Christopher Luxen, used Tereo Māori to pay tribute to the Lake Joe Hawke and received a spate of negative comments, including You Just Lost My Vote and Speak English for F's sake, so sick of Māori stuff. For me personally, I want to learn Tarea Māori. I have a lesson every Monday. The Human Rights Commission says it's noted a spike in recent comments on co-governance. We have a big part to play in helping our communities understand what co-governance is. There is real division building in the country around an understanding and interpretation of co-governance. Others say MPs are part of the problem. Who are behaving in ways that they know are stirring up racist sentiment. Sentiment that appears to be increasing across New Zealand. Mikey Sherman, One News. We're about to get a glimpse of the Queen as we've never seen her before. A documentary full of unseen private home movies has been released narrated by the monarch herself. The extraordinary look into Her Majesty's life is part of her platinum jubilee celebrations as Channel 9's Ely Walsh reports like many families my parents wanted to keep a record of our precious moments together from a little girl to the 25 year old woman who became our queen I always enjoyed capturing family moments private photos can often show the fun behind the formality. It's a rare insight using her home videos and her narration to show what's always really mattered to Her Majesty. Faith, family and friendship have been not only a constant for me, but a source of personal comfort. The Queen allowed programme makers to pour over 400 hours of home videos, taking viewers through the first 30 years of her life, before adulthood, before her father became ill, before she experienced the weight of the crown, a time when she was young, free, and falling in love. That mischievous inquiring Twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him. There's never-beforcing vision of a then-princess and her prince on their wedding day to delivering one of her first humble speeches upon becoming the backbone of Britain. I declare before you all, with my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and to the service of our great imperial family. The documentary has been broadcast to honour the upcoming platinum Jubilee to celebrate not only a monarch, but a daughter, a wife, mother and grandmother. One of the joys of living a long life is watching one's children, then grandchildren. And Elizabeth, the Unseen Queen, we'll screen here on TVNZ1 at 8 on Saturday night as part of the Platinum Jubilee.

It's chat, shall we? Wednesday, our food gurus are recreating another Kiwi classic. You definitely took the coating to that next, like fancy level. All new snack masters, Wednesday, 7.30 on 2. One News Sport is brought to you by mobile. Get more fuel economy with mobile synergy fuels. They'll get you where you need to go. Hocky minor. Welcome back to Sport and the Black Caps have had a special welcome to London, two days out from their highly anticipated first test against England. It comes as their 15-man squad for the series was named overnight. No surprises, though key bowler Trent Bolt has been ruled unlikely to play the opener. Europe correspondent Daniel Faitawa has been with the team. A home away from home. The black caps gathered for a special welcome in the heart of London. Great to be back at New Zealand House. Last year we unfortunately weren't able to come here but I guess to be over this side of the world and feel our home is pretty special. Special too for around 150 Kiwi expats and cricket fans. I think they probably head into the series of favourites and right and so. The reigning world champions obviously they've got a bit of work to do. The squad given a day off despite their shock loss in a warm-up game over the weekend, and at a wet Lord's cricket ground, another blow. News Trent Bolt and Henry Nichols may miss the first test. It's unlikely that Henry will play. Obviously with the COVID, that just put him back another week or so from where we were wanting. But he is progressing really well. I think at the moment he's an unlikely starter. So we will hold Michael Bracel here as extra cover. Earlier in the day, England's new test cricket era began. Kiwi-born duo, Skipper Ben Stokes and newly appointed coach Brendan McCullin seeing getting down to business at practice, an opportunity relished by this batsman, who knows it's a tough road ahead. The scrap's so hard. The skill levels are up there and we know that we're in for an absolute dog fight, to be honest with you, because that's exactly what they do each and every time. Back at NZ House, more pressing concerns. One black cap using a quick Q&A to ask about New Zealand citizenship. It's the hardest thing to get a black passport with someone in here can help me here. All fun and games. Till Thursday, Daniel Feintow, One News, London. For the past few years, the so-called next generation of tennis has been battling to break through against an established core of stars. But now an even younger group of newcomers has emerged and they are seriously threatening to upstage them with another teen making waves at Roland Garros. It's the biggest win of Holger-un's life. A teenager carving a slice of history into the clay of Roland Garros. Holger-Ewn becoming the first Danish man to reach the quarterfinals here. His opponent last year's finalist and world number four Stefano Sitzipas. I have an unbelievable feeling right now. I mean, I was so nervous at the end but the crowd was amazing for me, the whole match, the whole tournament. So I'm so grateful, I'm so happy to be playing on this course. You guys are amazing. And he got the crowd on side early. It's fantastic. What a point from Eun-Urna. Everyone on Chaturreate appreciating that effort from the 19-year-old. Wicked passing ground strokes paired with a number of wily drop shots. That's another stunner. The youngster digging in on the dirt as he teased and tormented Sitsipas. Insane tennis. Loving every moment is the 19 year old. The men's draws been devoid of major upsets so far. This one a clear signal that Carlos Alcaraz isn't the only one here living the teenage dream. At the other end of the scale, Marin Chillich showed veterans can also crash the party. In a battle of the Giants, it was the Croatians swatting aside Daniel Medvedev in straight sets. Chilich wins it. He rolls back the ears. A day for the old dogs and fresh faces, cruising to the quarterfinals. An intriguing battle awaits in Netball's premiership after the pulse snatched top spot off the Mystics last night. The central side with a dominant 51 to 43 win over the tactics in Christchurch to set up a crucial showdown with the Northerners in their last regular season game. The Mystics scrambling to prepare a team with COVID taking out their mid-court and Grace and Wecki still coming back from injury. People have forgotten how strong the mystic side were leading up to a couple of weeks ago and we had already secured a finals birth before we got COVID and before Grace's injury. There's been a lot of narrative and focus on what we don't have but I believe in what we have here. The winner of Friday's game will host the grand final, while the loser will face the stars in an elimination playoffs. New Zealand's squash team at this year's Commonwealth Games will feature the familiar faces of Paul Cole and Joelle King, but also some new talent hoping to follow their lead. Of the seven players named, Four will be attending their first games, including Abby Palmer, and brothers Luamba and Temwa Chilishi, who will be playing doubles together. A nice change from lining up against each other. Being each other pretty similar amount of times, I mean, I'm definitely a little bit bitter, but he'll probably say the same thing. Having Gold Coast medal winners like King and Cole is a huge boost for the newbies as they prepare for such a big event. Other than probably world number one. It's pretty high. It's pretty high, yeah. It's definitely the pinnacle in terms of making a team for our sport because we're not an Olympic sport. Kiwis won four squash medals in 2018, including two goals. When Wayne Smith took over his head coach of the Black Ferns, he made it clear that just months out from the World Cup, the status quo had to go. What you might not know is one of those changes had already started and is now an embedded part of being in camp. Jordan Oppet explains. It's rough and tough and awfully competitive. Once one person raises the bar and, you know, does a big hit, then everyone feels like they have to lift as well. I've been knocked over a couple of times, I'll tell you that. And it's Wayne Smith's idea. I grew up as a coach, not following the herd. I'm a bit weird, I think, as a coach. People who tell me I was weird. And so, yeah, we do a lot of things differently. I like a lot of game-based learning, and I like to ask questions for self-awareness rather than just instruct. Introducing dojo, a form of martial arts. A few years ago, we did eight weeks of jihitsu, like sole jihitsu, which has been really good for like body contact, but the dojo is more rugby specific, so it brings in that tack clean, the clean out, ball into contact, all that kind of stuff, you're kind of narrowing down into a micro of a skill. The soft surfaces a chance to hone in on technique and work on contact conditioning. He wants us to keep the ball alive in our game plans so just lots of keeping the ball alive, making sure our combat's really well executed. It's a real safe environment to come and really smash each other. So, yeah, it's been really cool, something different. And the Black Ferns are already seeing changes. I think they're more confident in the contact area, and we'll build that right through the tournament. We're up against some pretty big teams, teams that have been working for a long time in the gym, and so we've got to be able to equal that if not beat it. His first test, quite literally, humming in just six days' time. Jordan Oppet, one news. When Lydia Coe won the Pupuke Club Championships at the age of 11, it was the start of something pretty special in New Zealand Gulf. Now, 10-year-old Sarah Lee has followed in those exact footsteps, though her win might be even more impressive. And as Guy Havelte reports, that's not where the similarities between the two end. Sarah Lee has big goals in golf. I want to become LPGA and play in tournaments around the world. Sound like someone else we know? Well, there's a reason why you may be reminded of Lydia Coe when you hear the 10-year-old talk or see her swing a club. Because the similarities to her idol are uncanny. Sarah winning the Poo-Pookie Club champs in the weekend by a mere 39 shots. The same tournament co-won when she was 11, at times Sarah wasn't even alive. When Guy told me if you win this tournament you'll have your name gold on like a board and then I went to Papuuki and I saw Lady O'Re Co's name and I got really excited to play this competition. That was kind of very unheard of to have an 11 year old in the club champs let alone winning it. Yep that face will be familiar to those who have followed the career of Co as well. Her old coach Guy Wilson is taking Sarah on the same journey. You don't want to be over. I think the passion that comes through when she's playing golf, the smile and the way that she gets into practice does remind me a lot about Lydia. And the formula for helping to not only be good at golf but continue to enjoy it is fairly simple. We've got to keep it fun, got to keep it interesting, got to play little games, got to win, got to laugh and got to keep pushing her. Practice hard, that's basically it. The talented youngster with so many shades of a hero she's yet to meet. No, never, but I really want to meet her one day. It's far too early to truly call her the next Lydia Coe, but there's little doubt Sarah Lee wants to follow in her footsteps. Guy have out one news. Yeah, you heard it here first. Ten years old. Oh my word. Beautifully spoken, amazing swing. Amazing looking talent, isn't she? Looking forward to hearing many more stories. Thank you very much, Chris.

Just take, for instance, today. Take a look at the scenes here. Gorgeous looking style today. Frank Manning, thank you for this. North Shore of Auckland. Lovely looking start. But contrast that. Go back to the weather maps with some heavier showers. Look at this. Showers spilling their way across the Alps. Further south as well. It was rainbows, singles, and even doubles. One band of rain going away. After that cleared through, we had fine-looking weather. The next one is bearing down. And you see how these things have hooks. That shows upper energy. The thing winding up. That one is the one coming in tonight. Quick radar check. It was zooming close. You can see the main boundary there. That's got a lot of lightning, some heavy downpours. Pretty squawly winds, too. You can just see the leading edge there. And I'll show you how this thing looks right now. Heads up tonight. You can see the main area there, moving into parts of Northland. Heads up Taranaki, Northland, Auckland, probably about 10 to about midnight or so, and much of the West Coast. So watch for that. Heavy, squally winds. Those watch, of course, for some risk for some damage. Coastal funnels as well as that thing churns through. Lots of blotches of yellow and orange. Rain warnings to the West Coast. Wind, strong and severe gales from the far north towards Taranaki and as well to parts of Crook Strait. There's a bit of everything thrown in this mix. That's tonight. Push the main front through. Boom. That comes through. As I say, heads up overnight midnight. That'll barrel its way through. Then we get all this engine room. Squally showers, particularly from Wicato's southwards to the West Coast. Rain, that's going to pile in. Notice not as much rain to eastern it. It's more likely a boundary of rain. You say, when does it quieten down? Probably by the weekend. So that's the band of rain tonight. It's more likely overnight rain to North and then showers, then you're back to sunshine tomorrow. So if you sleep in late, you go, where was it? 20 degrees, Auckland, same thing. Tie stuff down, it'll be squally probably around midnight, 21 degrees. Early showers, then you're fine. Most of the more likely one or two. Hamilton being further south could see some more showers after the overnight rain, 19 or 20, and a similar sort of thing for the Bay of Plenty's central plateau. That's the rain. Then notice how the blue kind of fills, and particularly for places like Tokoroa, Topo, and Tamerui, as that stuff comes in for the afternoon really gets going. So there's a bit of that, too, with some pretty strong gusty winds, Toranga as well. Overnight rain, a few showers in the morning, and then otherwise, OK, bright spells, pretty gusty with those west-northwest winds. Overnight rain here for the East Coast. Early showers, then you're fine. 21, 22 degrees, yeah, with that pretty warm western or west direction. Heads up for Pastor Taranaki, strong squawly rain overnight. And then this trough here, that comes in probably into the afternoon. I mention those strong squawly winds. Watch for those around the coast. That's down to the lower North Island, too. So it'll be a bit of a wild sort of day. Wellington watch for that risk for some strong squally winds, maybe some thunder close to town too. You may even hear a rumble as that churns through. Hang on to your hats and further south through Teuipunamu, much of the south outer rain it is heavy to the west coast too that will work its way through west port you really be in the thick of it through the course of the day rain really piling its way in overnight rain for christchurch then otherwise fine 18 degrees if you can believe at top temperature today was 23 wasn't christchurch wasn't the east of the north island it was the needoniedon Airport, 23 degrees, 10 degrees above. There's your rain, heavy, squawly, thundry to the west coast. Overnight rain further east, then fine, then dry. Queensland, we continue with the showers overnight. More through the day, 14 degrees for you with that gusty old wind. To the rest of the far south, you can see the squawley showers too. More likely one or two for the overnight to sparse the south, and then otherwise dry, 15 degrees. And as I just mentioned, Denedden today, 23 degrees of the airport, 10 degrees above. You've got 17 tomorrow. Overnight rain through the day tomorrow. It's otherwise dry. Get into Thursday. Put the color on. Three to six meter swells. West Coast heads up lower North Island into early Thursday. Friday, that's heavy swells to the West Coast. When is this thing going away? Snow level of thousand meters or lower to the far south. But guess what? It does quieten down by the weekend. But there's a pretty wild weather coming our way next couple of days. Goodbye autumn. Hello winter. Thank you very much for that, Dan."}
