The next move for nurses, they are refusing to vote on the government's pay offer after years of negotiation. And now the clouds have parted we tour the area's hardest hit by Cyclone Fili. Thank you, all, Katoa, good evening. Newsab can reveal mayors are seeking advice from lawyers over a surprise clause in their Three Waters' compensation contract, banning them from criticising the reforms. The opposition's calling it a gag order, but the government says it's no such thing. Political reporter, Amelia Wade, has this exclusive story. Three waters, the controversial reforms to fix New Zealand's aging pipes and clean up are dirty water. But councils say the government's done a dirty on them over the deal. The amount of money that we're talking about is just peanuts compared to the total value of communities' assets in Three Waters infrastructure. The government's starting to splash the Three Waters cash. Applications open to councils this week for the first $500 million slice of the $2 billion funding pie. It's called the Better Off package. It's to support local government to look towards other areas of obligations that have been unable to fund because they've been constrained by their balance sheet. The agreement has Manawatu Mayor Helen Warboys who heads up a group of 32 mayors opposing the reforms, lawyering up. And of course the first thing we're doing is getting some legal advice around that. Especially as in the deal is what's been slammed as a gag order. It states councils who get the cash must not at any time do anything which could have an adverse effect on the reputation, good standing or goodwill of the Department of Internal Affairs or the government. Does that extend to, well, if you sign this agreement, our council no longer can push back against opposing the reform model. You know, there's those kind of implications there. If you do take the money, then you're sure can't criticise the government. That doesn't feel right. It does feel like a gag order. In a statement, the Department of Internal Affairs told News Hub no clause in the funding agreement prevents or prohibits any council from publicly expressing its own views. It is a common and prudent clause in public funding documents as a safeguard to protect against the misuse of public funds. I think you only need to look at how the debates transpired over the last four years to know that this has been a very active debate. The Minister promising this is no gag order. Hiora, Amelia, so is three waters dead in the water? Well, Mike, the government says that this clause is frequently used in public funding contracts and promises it won't be used to gag councils. But even the threat of it has mayors reaching for their lawyers' numbers, especially given that Three Waters is probably the most contentious piece of work the government is trying to get through. Manuatu Mayor Helen Warboys told me that this mess is the opposite of transparent, especially coming from the government which swore to be the most transparent yet. The Newsop understands that there was meant to be an assurance about this clause in a letter which went out to Mears, but for whatever reason that has disappeared. But when you're telling councils to hand over their water assets, you better make sure everything is watertight. Amelia Wade live from Parliament to Nacquay. New Zealand Nurses' organisation is refusing to take an historic pay equity offer to its members for a vote. It comes after backlash from the workforce that the new pay rates wouldn't be backdated to 2019, which nurses say was agreed to in earlier deals. Ashley Yates has more. It's been a long, arduous battle. And the fight over pay equity isn't about to end anytime soon. A vote on the deal's been cancelled by the nurses' union. The components that relate to backdating in that proposal from the DHBs are contrary to the Equal Pay Act. Legal advice that was sought after mounting backlash from nurses. That's because a condition to backdate new salary grades to 2019 agreed to by nurses was scrapped. The U-turned by the union leaving the minister concerned. It is very unusual for a union to relitigate terms of settlement that they have already signed up to. Andrew Little front-footed the situation, holding a media conference before the union told its members. They notified me last night and said that they were going to let their members know this morning. We wanted to make sure our members had the full facts in front of them. Despite this, some nurses say they're relieved. I think it shows a lot of recognition on their part that nurses were unhappy and that they're listening to us. Instead of full back pay, a lump sum payment of up to $10,000 was offered. But that leaves Michaela Judson and her colleagues in Wellington Hospital's ICU out of pocket. From what I've heard from a lot of nurses, especially in my department, they're owed, you know, between $20,000 to $30,000. There are limits, and I have to say that in relation to this pay deal, there is no more funding to put into it. The government says it would add more than $520 million to the health payroll. The offer lifts paychecks by up to $16,000 to correct gender-based undervaluation. My expectation is that the parties to this pay equity agreement stand by what they've agreed to. We'll be asking our members to vote on whether or not they want us to refer the case directly to the Employment Relations Authority. Another vote, but not the one the government was expecting. Okay, Ashley, what will happen next for nurses? Sam nurses could still decide to go through the ratification process and vote on whether to accept the original offer or not. The union has told me that this vote could take place in two weeks' time. As for getting back around the table, the union says if there's a chance to bargain, they are standing by, ready and waiting. However, it's not known if and when that will happen. Ashley, ten aque. The sun has come out from behind the clouds of cyclone Fili. It's left a trail of destruction across Wairo and Tairaferi Gisbon. Shannon Redstalls visited the Ruikituri Valley, left with just one way in and one way out. A road to nowhere. The Ruikituri Bridge buckled and bent after weeks of relentless rain. When you don't have sunshine for 11 days, you know, it takes its toll. Nuku Hadfield lives in the valley and took Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allen for a drive to survey the damage. Really genuinely interested in see what's going on? and took emergency management minister Kiri Allen for a drive to survey the damage. Really genuinely interested in see, but what's going on? Relentless heavy rain has changed the landscape in parts of rural Wairoa. At the end of March, it rained here for 11 days in a row, so Cyclone Fili just added insult to injury. Some of these slips could happen now, even though the rain stopped, the soles are so wet that we could have a slip just out of the blue. Across the two regions, residents woke to dozens of closed roads and thousands were without power. As predicted, isolated communities were cut off or reduced to just one access. Really isolated. And if, you know, you might be all right for three to four days, but it's when it starts to get out to one to two weeks. After seeing the extent of the damage, Minister Allen announced $100,000 for the Wairoa Meral Relief Fund. This community is really hurting. This is a huge confidence boost to them. It's going to be weeks before people can even walk across this bridge again. From here to get to Wairo town, it's going to take you about 20 minutes. From here to get to Wairo Town in absence of this bridge, it's going to take you about an hour and a half. But for now, people are just grateful to have the power on and the sun shining. Shannon Redstone News Hub. The parents of a teenager attacked in a violent schoolyard incident captured on video. Are furious no one intervened or called for help. Auckland police are investigating last Friday's alleged assault at Papatoi Toy High School, which left the 13-year-old victim traumatised and unable to return to school. Karen Rutherford has more. The concussion rod and Rachel's child endured is hard to see. What is obvious in this video taken last Friday lunchtime on Papatoi Toi High's top field is just how powerful the punches were that allegedly caused his injuries. I just felt so sad for my boy because of how he was alone in that moment and no one really came forward. There was no one who stepped in, no one tried to stop it, no one ran for help. The Year 9 boy accepts he made hurtful remarks to a female classmate earlier in the day. The alleged attack by a year 11 came at lunchtime as a dozen teachers patrolled the high school's campus. That particular incident occurred out of eyesight line. And of course when people engage in those sorts of activities, they're trying to find a place where no one can see them. And so, yeah, particularly nasty. And instantly we feel for the person who is the victim in this situation. Police now have the video in the area commander for counties Monaco says his officers are investigating and will take follow-up action. They'll be interviewing all parties involved in the incident. The school says it had no idea of the attack until the boy's father notified them on Monday before going to police. They're responsible for his care when I drop him off at school. And those kids, they're seniors, they're all seniors, all of them standing over and looking and not doing nothing. Unacceptable. Principal Vaughan Coillo also heads the secondary principals' association. All of them standing over and looking and not doing nothing, unacceptable. Principal Vaughan Kuyo also heads the secondary principal's association and says, while it's no excuse, schools nationally are seeing more violence since the pandemic. A decision on disciplinary action in this case, he says, won't be taken lightly. I would consider this instance to be at the upper end of that range of tools. And for bystanders everywhere, a message from a mum. People need to feel like they can speak up, that they can stand up, that this is not okay. In any shape or form. Karen Rutherford, NewsHub. Outgoing and outspoken Labor MP, Lewisa Wall, has just delivered a fiery, valedictory speech in her last day at Parliament. Political editor, General Lynch, joins us now live in Jenna. Louisa Wall, has just delivered a fiery valedictory speech in her last day at Parliament. Political editor, Jenna Lynch, joins us now live in Jenna. Louisa Wall has chosen to go out swinging. Yeah, it was very much a will-she-won-wive ahead of this speech. Lewisa Wall has not pulled a single punch this week, accusing the Prime Minister of holding a decade-long grudge against her and wanting her gone. Valedictories are normally a chance for MPs to reflect on their time in this place to celebrate their successes, of which Lewis Will had many, most notably of course, giving New Zealand same-sex marriage, but Wool chose to keep firing all the way out the door, taking aim once more at the selection process that saw her lose her seat at the last election and one last dig at the Labour leadership. When I was forced out of my electorate in 2020 by the unconstitutional actions of the party President Claire Zabo and some members of council, I was devastated. And it is as a result of that corrupt process that I'm standing to deliver my valedictory statement today. But I want to be very clear that this was not entirely my choice. Being in a team where there is no appetite for your contribution is not healthy. Now, Wall is able to use words like corrupt under the cloak of parliamentary privilege in this house, and this was her last opportunity to do. So I've heard from Labor Party President Claire Zabo, who says that that selection process was in accordance with the Constitution and that she wishes Wall well on her future endeavors. Wall had one lasting in her tale for her caucus colleagues as well, saying that her one regret in leaving this place was that Labor as a party and as a government did not have the courage to officially confirm the status of Māori as the Indigenous people of New Zealand. She says her caucus never backed her on that, and in fact even made her withdraw a bill from the ballot that would have addressed it before the 2020 election. So with that mic drop, Lewis the Wall is officially out. Our political editor, General Lynch, life from Parliament. Jenna, thank you. Now we're into the orange setting. And New Zealand is dropping the requirement to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test to fly. The airline says 125,000 people are booked to travel within the country over the Easter weekend. It's also dropping its no jab, no flight rule for international travelers from the 1st of May. Meanwhile, there were just over 9,000 new community cases reported today. 519 people are in hospital with COVID, including 24 who are in intensive care. And sadly, another 16 people with COVID, including 24 who are in intensive care. And sadly, another 16 people with COVID have died. All were over the age of 60. Omicron has had an impact on cancer services with the Cancer Control Agency, saying it's found a drop in diagnoses. The number of those diagnosed with cancer has fallen by 2% overall, but for Māori, it was a 17% drop and a 22% drop in surgeries. Chief Executive Professor Diana Safati says the agency will be monitoring numbers closely. What we've seen in the first two months of this year is some disruption to cancer services. One thing we are concerned about though is the disruption seems to be bigger for Māori than for non-Mari, and that's the first time we've seen that so that is something that we're looking at really closely. Professor Safari is encouraging people to see their GP if they have any unusual symptoms. The world's biggest Kappa Haka Festival Te Matatini celebrates 50 years today and to mark the occasion organisers have created an album with 50 Wyata, a book and content with key people who have been involved since 1972. The launch comes just days after Tematini confirmed its next national competition will happen next year, from February 21st to the 25th at Auckland's Na Anahai at Eden Park Eden Park. Heather is here now with today's weather, which is ending a bit calmer than it started. Absolutely. Cyclone Philly has finally gone, leaving a sunny and gorgeous afternoon for the East Coast, but not before dumping 200 millimetres of rain on the East Cape since this time last night. It was a chilly and frosty morning for some. Lewis Passa Manipori woke to minus two degrees. Now, will it be an excellent Easter forecast? I'll tell you after sports. Oh, we will find out later.

Okie Mae Anur, welcome back. Backwards, archaic and punitive. That's how Easter trading laws are being described. Just as New Zealand opens up to Aussies and welcomes fewer restrictions under the orange traffic light setting, another set of restrictions comes into play. Keisha Brownlee reports. Christchurch's Riverside Market is rolling out all the stops to welcome its customers this Easter. It's classed as a tourist destination, so it's open for trading, with the exception of three bars that are restricted by the Shop Trading Hours Act. We have asked if we included some food in their offerings, whether they could open, but we've unfortunately been told they can't even though they're inside the market building with all the takeaway offerings. It's a law Labour MP Karen McNulty is trying to change. Any other day of the year, the alcohol is licensed on the basis of health, but on Easter it's licensed on the basis of religion, and that doesn't make sense to me. McNulty says the restrictions encourage stockpiling. You shouldn't have to buy a roast meal just to have a pint on Easter Sunday. Under the Shop Trading Hours Act on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, most shops have to close. Unless they meet a set of conditions, they have an area exemption or their local council has adopted an Easter trading policy. Sort of like one step forward, two steps back. You know, you've got these two public holidays with these punitive, archaic rules that are in place after they've already been putting up with plenty of rules over this terrible COVID time. Rules are something people are growing tired of. If employers want to open and they've got employees that are willing to work, then they should be have the option, yeah. I think that all shots should be open any time over Easter because it's probably in this day and age they need the income and they need the work. Retail New Zealand says it doesn't make sense to ban shopping on Easter Sunday because it isn't actually a public holiday. It's not a ban on working. So there are shops that will have their teams in store doing stock take or other work on Sunday. It's just that they're not allowed to open the doors to the public. They can do that on Monday. Kasha Brownlee, News Hub. The Easter holiday road toll period began just a few hours ago, with authorities hoping there won't be a repeat of last year's mayhem. Nine people died on our roads over Easter in 2021. This year there's an added complication with the closure tonight of one of the busiest stretches of motorway in the country. Adam Hollingworth joins us now live from Auckland's Spaghetti Junction, Adam. Mike, yes, State Highway 1 will be closed northbound out of Auckland at 10.30 tonight. It will reopen to traffic one lane during the day tomorrow, but will again close tomorrow night. The reason is that there is a bridge joint on the Nelson Street overpass which needs replacing. Waka Kotahi says there's no immediate threat, but the work does need to be done straight away. Leave Adam there. Thank you, Adam. I'm not sure what happened there, but we will find out and make sure that he's okay. In other news, a Russian flagship battlecruiser has exploded and the crew forced to abandon ship. Ukraine says it was the result of a missile strike while the Russians say a fire broke out in the ammunition room. The ship pictured by satellite a few days ago as the Moskva, the same ship that was told in no uncertain terms to F off when it tried to seize a Ukrainian island at the start of the invasion. Meanwhile, Russia has shown what it says is video of Ukrainian troops surrendering in the battle for the port city of Maripol. But as Europe correspondent Lisa Ed Raymer reports, the propaganda battlefront is raging. Marched out of Maripol with their arms raised, Russia claims this is the moment more than a thousand Ukrainian Marines surrendered, the end of a battle at the heart of this war. The Russian footage is so far unverified. Maripol's mayor says they are fighting on, but the Ukrainian unit warned the world earlier this week that it was preparing for a final fight that without weapons would either end in death or capture. Kiev has been parading its own captive. Pro-Russian politician and friend of Putin's Viktor Medvedevich has been caught disguising himself as a Ukrainian soldier. Russia says the photo is a fake. This video, however, covered in BBC branding we know is not real. It has been circulating online and shown on Russian state TV and reports Ukraine attacked its own civilians. The British broadcaster has warned people not to trust it. The propaganda machine moving as quickly as the Russian troops are towards the border. New satellite images show an ominous build-up to the east of Ukraine. President Zelensky knows what is coming and he is pleading for more weapons before it does. Freedom must be armed better than tyranny. Western countries have everything to make it happen. The final victory over the tyranny and the number of people saved depends on them. Armed Ukraine now to defend freedom. President Biden has responded with an $800 million package, money to match his decision to officially label the war a genocide. Another mass grave was uncovered in Butcher today. It's these horrors that have forced Russia's neutral neighbours to rethink their own security. Finland and Sweden now looking to join NATO. Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine. And neutrality is rapidly losing its place in a war-ravaged world. In London, Leasette Raymond Newsop. We were talking before about Easter traffic congestion. We had a bit of pedestrian congestion there too with our reporter Adam Hollingworth. We're going to cross back now to Adam. Adam, we hope you're okay. Yes. And can you tell us what's going on with the other traffic over Easter weekend? Yes, Mike and Sam's state Highway 1 will be closed to traffic northbound out of Auckland at 10.30 tonight. It will be reopened to one lane of traffic during the day tomorrow, but will again close tomorrow night. Waka Katahi are saying that there is a bridge joint on the Nelson Street overpass which needs replacing. Waukotahi says there's no immediate risk, but they do need to do the work immediately. And that's why the police in Auckland are telling people to steer clear of central Auckland during this weekend. But the message in general from the police is to be patient. When people get congested, they become impatient. What we want is for people to be very calm when they're driving their vehicle on the roads this Easter period. Because when we know that when people become impatient, they make really bad decisions. And it's the bad decisions that are getting people killed and seriously injured on our roads every day of the week. And nine people died on the roads last Easter. That was a record of 11 years. We've since moved to Orange, which means there are more cars on the roads last Easter. That was a record of 11 years. We've since moved to Orange, which means there are more cars on the road. And we've also launched the road to zero. That's a campaign to reduce the road toll to zero by 2050. And for those reasons alone, they do not want a repeat of last year. And so, as you can see behind me, the traffic is building up. But the message from police is be patient, take care and plan your journey. Our reporter Adam Hollingworth there in central Auckland. Thank you so much Adam. Well, Noreles on later with sport and netball is embracing the move to orange. That's right, Mike.

Dancing with the stars Premier Sunday April 24 on 3 and 3 now The Transport Accident Investigation Commission's released a report into what could have been a catastrophic mid-air collision that we've never known about till now. In March 2019, two Air New Zealand dash 8s were fewer than two minutes away from crashing into one another on their descent into the capital. It's unclear how many passengers were on board. The pilot of the second dash 8 was told to follow the first dash eight for its landing, but instead mistook another plane in Airbus A320 for the aircraft it was meant to be following, putting itself on a collision course. But the crisis was averted. Pilots got an activation of an alert system in the cockpit that told them there was a danger and it came in both cockpits at the same time and both the pilots took the exact actions they needed to take to avoid the collision. The media mix-up highlighted a number of serious safety concerns which the transport watchdogs says Air New Zealand and air traffic control have since addressed. If you often suffer from headaches or migraines, a new study has found you're far from alone. Scientists in Norway have found more than half the world's population experienced headache disorders in the last year, and it's the leading cause of disability for those under 50. Kethaki Masalamani reports. There's a lot that can set one off. A little bit of stress. Not being hydrated enough. Hormonal migraines. Studying long hours and just getting really tight on my neck and shoulders. Maybe too much to drink. Norwegian scientists assist 357 studies between 1961 and 2020, which looked at evidence of the global prevalence of headache disorders. They found 46% of adult populations have an active headache disorder. 11% experience migraines, 42% tension-type headaches, and 3% experience chronic daily headaches. Headaches and migraines are an invisible condition, so it is easy for people to brush it under the carpet and think that it's normal. Migraines are often hereditary. The World Health Organisation has identified them among the 10 most disabling conditions, ranking it higher for females. Because while 17% of women experience migraines, that drops to 8.6% for men. Generally, you don't get headaches? Rarely. Not often, no. Not a lot, no. Auckland DHB neurologist Dr Rosamund Hill says while milder headaches can often be solved with a bit of kai in water. She says Kiwis tend to brush off severe migraines when they should be asking their GPs for help. Often the cause of headache and migraine can be treated. Because too much relief too can lead to, you guessed it, a headache. Kepki Masalamini News Hub. The man police arrested for the New York subway shootings called him themselves on the crime stopper's hotline. As Channel 7's David Boywood reports, when they got his location, he'd gone, but not far. Without incident, police swarm on 62-year-old Frank James, leading him away in handcuffs not far from the scene of yesterday's attack. My fellow New Yorkers, we got him. We got him. James charged with a federal terrorism offences now staring down life behind bars for his alleged masterminding of this attack. We were able to shrink his world quickly. There was nowhere left for him to run. Prosecutors say after detonating smoke bombs, James fired 33 rounds from his Glock before fleeing across the platform and boarding another train to escape. I wanted to kill people. I wanted to why she would die right in front of my f*** face immediately.

Make every day exceptional with the new Suzuki Bolano and News Hub Sport. It's been a frustrating couple of weeks, but things are slowly returning to normal for the A&Z Premiership. The move to the orange light setting means that on Saturday, the Canterbury Tactics will host the first indoor sporting event in front of crowds. But the challenges are far from over for our domestic netball teams. Gordon Finlayter has more. For the first time this season, the ANZ Premiership is preparing for fans. Over the last few years, we've maxed out the stadium, so that is music to our ears. And for other reasons than just having a home crowd to cheer them on. We'll really help the teams financially. It'll make a big difference. They'll be able to support their partners in the way that was intended for the season. We were staring down some quite negative-looking figures. What you would lose if you didn't have the crowds, it's quite a lot of money. So I guess for the whole netball going forward, it's massive news. Saturday's match against the Northern Stars will be the tactics first in almost three weeks, after several players tested positive following their last game against the magic. And for several sick players, more time on the bench means less time to impress Silverfern's selectors ahead of the Commonwealth Games. I think my symptoms pushed myself back a little bit and I wasn't able to fit the two 90 minutes in before we could play this weekend. It just reminds us that every opportunity that you do get, you need to put it all out there because you don't know when your next one's going to come. A concept of the tactics are all too familiar with. It's going to be a little bit of a jigsaw puzzle. I'll be in the crowd, hopefully making some noise. And hopefully there will be plenty of others doing the same as the competition looks to recoup at least some of its losses. Gordon Fintlater, Newsop. Black Cap swing bowler Tim Southie has reigned supreme at the New Zealand Cricket Awards. He's won the Sir Richard Hadley Medal for the first time, thanks to his consistency throughout the summer, at home and abroad, in red and white ball cricket. He claimed 36 wickets highlighted by a six-wicket bag against England at Lords in June, and five wickets in the World Test Championship final. Well, there was plenty of emotion in this morning's Champions League quarter finals, with Manchester City's nill all draw with Atlago Madrid marred by ugly scenes on full-time. The two sides came to blows nearing the 19-minute mark after a foul on Phil Foden before footage emerged of an ugly altercation in the tunnel after the match. It wasn't something city manager Pep Guadiola was prepared to discuss as his side sealed a semi-final clash with Rail Madrid on aggregates. When he went down the tunnel, was that beer you had thrown on you? I didn't talk about reference. The action was, everyone saw the action and that's all. So nothing to say. There was far less drama at Anfield where Liverpool booked a semi-final showdown with Villa Real after a three-all-drawer against Benfica sent the Reds through on aggregate. This time tomorrow night, the Wellington Phoenix will be home. Although they'll be missing youngsters Sam Sutton, who tested positive for COVID-19 before last night's 1-0 win over Perth. But for the most part, the Knicks are headed back to the capital with wind in their sails. The sales have dropped everything to see Ollie play at home for the first time in nearly a year. Well, we were supposed to be going to the Bay of Islands for our Easter holiday and as soon as Phoenix said they were coming home we're like, no, we're going to Wellington. But perhaps the thing they've missed most about the next goalkeeper. Well, it tells a lot of yarns so you've got to filter that. But filling that void for the last week is injured Captain Alex Rufor. He doesn't cook. He doesn't do much. Very well, man. He's a pleasure to have. Recovering with the sales after an ACL reconstruction, and with five sons already, what difference does another make. I mean, I don't know if they'd want another son, but I think for this week I have been, so I'm really grateful. I'm just really excited to see the boys again and hopefully they put on a good show for the crowd and just hopefully you get the W. Also back in Auckland receiving treatment for an ankle injury, midfielder Clayton Lewis. Even for me I get to go see my family which is quite nice but yeah the main reason for everyone coming back is obviously we've got a job to do on Sunday so hopefully the crowd comes out. And a record-breaking one at that, to better last season's homecoming, where more than 24,000 loyal fans turned out to show their support. I get quite nervous watching the games, to be honest. It's quite hard, especially being a goalkeeper. But no, it's awesome seeing him do this thing. They'll get to see that on Sunday in the capital and then in Auckland. It's nice to get the boys back over here and we'll support them and just be good to see him as well. And we'll be happy for him to leave again after a couple. And hopefully taking six points back to Aussie with them. Well, it's no surprise that snowboard sensations, Zoe Sadowski-Sinit, has ended her competitive season on the podium, this time securing bronze in the natural selection finals in Alaska. The 21-year-old held a narrow lead after her first run on the remote Alaskan backcountry, navigating a tricky course with ease. And despite an impressive start on run, two fools mentioned one of the two spots in the final. Lovely from three. That was very few. Oh no, and going down at the very bottom. I mean, part of this could just be, this is a long run. It's not without an element of exhaustion. The bronze is Sadowski-Sinit's eighth podium from eight events this season, including two Winter Olympic medals. Finally tonight, Chiefs midfielder Alex Nankerville has reached a significant milestone in his career. But rather than keeping his prized 50-game playing jersey, he's put it up for auction to support cure kids. And as Natasha Payne reports, there's a heartfelt reason why. Alex Nankerville is grinning because he couldn't be happier to give this away. And it's all because of someone he's never met. My oldest brother, William, he passed away at the start of 996. He had neuroblastoma, which is a form of cancer. William was only four years old. After chemo and an eight-hour surgery, he was in remission. But within a year the cancer returned, and this time it was terminal. He died just five weeks later. Although the brothers never met in person, they have a special connection. William passed away in January, 1996, and I was born nine months later, so my mum thinks I'm kind of like a gift from him. As he grew older, the 25-year-old realized how hard it must have been for his parents to lose their first child. So in 2019, he became an ambassador for Cure Kids. So, despite his 50th cat being special, he decided to sell it to raise not only money, but also awareness. Just getting their name out there so people can help. But no matter the price tag on the jersey come tomorrow morning, William will never stop being his younger brother's inspiration. Knowing that I had an older brother who kind of didn't really get the opportunity to live, that kind of motivates me to do the best I can. And with his momentum at the moment, who knows what jerseys in Ankenille will be wearing and auctioning off next. Natasha Payne, News Hub. And guys, that auction closes at 9.30 tomorrow morning and last I checked it was already at $1,200. So great stuff. Oh, it's fantastic. I'm sure it's going to go up a lot from there. That's true. It may we feel a little bit tearing. Oh, all right. It may not quite be up there with Neil Armstrong telling NASA the eagle has landed on the moon. But a kebab splashed down off the coast of Turkey after a bid to become the first of its kind in space. The owner of a kebab restaurant decided to mark the anniversary of the first human to reach space Uri Gagarin in 1961. The kebab was launched by helium balloon and got to 38 kilometres high before the balloon popped and the dish parachuted back down. The launch crew joked it may have been set back by aliens because it was too spicy. Electric vehicles are the talk of the New York International Auto Show, which opens to the public in a few hours' time. There's a dedicated test track for visitors who want to try the latest technology. And as CBS's Chris Van Cleave reports, even one of America's most fearsome gas guzzlers is going green. The Hummer is back and leaving its 10 miles per gallon legacy in the dust. This 1,000 horsepower monster is all electric. It's just the next step. You know, it's the dust. This 1,000 horsepower monster is all electric. It's just the next step. You know, it's the future. Ingo Hagman already has an old military Humvee and was among the first to get the 2022 GMC Hummer EV. I spend about $13,400 a month in gas and it's just very high. It's a small mortgage payment. The Gulf War made the Humvee a household name. And 30 years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger used his star power to help turn it into an unapologetic SUV that could go just about anywhere. GM added the H2 and smaller H3 before surging gas prices and the Great Recession halted production. The Ford F150 has been the nation's best-selling vehicle for decades. Its all-electric lightning debuts this spring. Last month, Cadillac began production of its first electric SUV, the Lyric. At upstart Rivian's new mid-size pickup, won Motor Trends 2020 truck of the year. Dozens of other new EVs will hit the streets over the next few years. We're coming to the point soon. We're driving an electric car is the only financially sensible thing to do. As gas prices climb, online searches for EVs are surging up 173% last month. Fifty-five percent of gas-powered car owners say they're considering going electric. GMC already has 65,000 reservations for the new Hummer, despite a price tag topping six figures. Okay, so we break hard, and now we floor it. You could say, it's going fast, like zero to 60 in three seconds fast. Oh, wow, you feel that. Excellent. 70% of those ordering the Hummer EV are new to electrics, including Ingo Hagman. You've gone green. Do you think you'd ever go back? Honestly, I don't see a reason to go back. Unapologetically, plugging into a future free from guzzling gas. Coming up next, we have News Hub weather, and it was cold this morning for some. Is it going to be a repeat for Good Friday, Heather? Well, it looks like it. A little chilly to start Easter and the long weekend. Hamilton will wait to four degrees, Waiuru on zero. Frost expected for Tomerunui and Masterton 2, and fog for Queenstown and Alexandra. I'll have full details next, and then there's a bit of a scandal on the project.

Your motorsport here on three. Tomorrow's weather, bad for Swanies, great for making power. At Rudion, we only generate power from wind, water and sun. Kiyoro, welcome back. Easter weekend is almost here and I know many have fingers crossed for fine weather and for tomorrow at least it's looking good. This is the sort of weather map you want to see. We've got high pressure parked up over the country coming in off the Tasman and that delivers calm and fine weather tomorrow for most. The exception is a trough and cold front approaching from the south and that will move across the South Island on Saturday morning. So looking mainly fine for Tewaiponamu, the South Island. There will be cloudy periods up the West Coast, Canterbury and Kaikolra tomorrow and showers for Fjordland. But other than that, nice and clear. Norwesterlies do pick up a little in the afternoon for the deep south. Fine tonight for Teika Amawi, the North Island, with southerly winds for the top half. Tomorrow it's so clear in the morning that there may be areas of frost. Isolated showers pop up in the Bay of Plenty 2 with light winds for the whole island. So Good Friday looks just that in the north. Good. It's a little chilly in the morning. 4 degrees for Hamilton but warms with the sun with light winds. 22 degrees, the high for Kaitaya. A beautiful morning here too with fine skies and light winds. Cloud develops in the afternoon along the coast with the potential for a shower or two with highs of 20 degrees. Finally, some sunshine and calm days for the East Coast, but check out that morning low. Masterton can expect a frost. The winds stay light for all here too. Taumirunui will also wait to a frost with mainly fine weather for all. Cloud develops in the evening with light winds. Palmer North warms to 19 degrees. Crossing Temoana, Orokawa Cook Strait and apart from some morning cloud, the West Coast will have a lovely day ahead. The cloud clears with light winds and highs just under the 20 mark. A cooler start to the day for the east of the island with some morning cloud, but it warms and the cloud disappears in the afternoon with nor easterlies developing. And morning cloud, expected for some here with possible fog for Queenstown and Alexandra. Winds pick up after lunch, but the cloud clears with highs in the late tings. So, Otepoti, Dunedin will be fine tonight and fine tomorrow. There may be some fog inland, which lifts northerlys developing in the afternoon. Another chilly morning, but not frosty here. There will be pockets of cloud, but it clears throughout the day with no easterlees developing. Now, the capital will also be fine tomorrow with northerlies and a high of 20 for the Hutt Valley. Cloud will develop heading into the evening. A fine night and fine Friday for the-Mato Maui Hawks Bay. Enjoy the kind of weather as it will be calm too, only light winds and a high of 18 for Napier. Mainly fine for Tauranga, the morning certainly is the sunnier part of the day. There is cloud developing in the afternoon that could deliver the odd shower. It's fine for Keri-Roa Hamilton too with light winds. A cooler start with four degrees but warming nicely to 21 for the Waikato District. Tamaki Makoto, Auckland will also wait to fine weather, light winds across the day, and a region-wide high of 21 degrees. Now, across the Tasman, and showers continue for Brisbane and Kens, but it's dry for Sydney, Shows also expected in Tasmania. And sunny for Fiji, Nui and Tonga with showers elsewhere. New Caledonia will be quite wet, with rain settling in. So looking down the Easter track, and Saturday is okay, but a wet and windy couple of days are expected for Fungare from Sunday, thanks to an approaching front, showers spread elsewhere on Easter Monday. Again, Saturday looks good here, but showers return to the East Coast on Saturday and tracked to Tauronga on Monday. Windy for Wellington on Saturday, then showers on Sunday. Monday looks great for all here though. Shows in the west and east on Saturday, but gradually clearing for Greymouth, isolated showers on Sunday for Kikoda, with clear skies for all next week. And heavy rain on Saturday for the deep south with showers, but it all blows over and the second half of Easter is looking lovely. So finally tonight, a big thanks to 12-year-old Kaden for sending this through. A beautiful sunset last night in the Waikato. Oh, and hopefully the Easter bunny brings him lots of chocolate. He deserves it. Thank you very much, Heather. And that is News Hub Live at 6 for today. Rebecca Wright will have more news on News Hub Live at 8 on Eden and the NewsHub Late Teams here at 1030. I'm Samantha Hayes. I'm Mike McRoberts and have a safe and happy Easter. Now on the project."}
