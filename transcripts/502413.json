New crimes and new police powers are raft of changes to tackle gang violence are on the way. The cars, the bikes and the bling all set to be seized, but will it make our streets safer? The superpower and the Pacific. Kamala Harris heads a US charm offensive to the region, admitting America's drop the ball and promises to do better. But who's listening in? And the electric commute goes into overdrive. Thanks to Kiwi ingenuity, transforming diesel buses to green ones in a southern hemisphere first. How your ride to work could change. No-Mai, hi-em-i, welcome to One News. Aiming to hit gangs where it hurts them. a raft of new law changes has been announced. They target guns, vehicles and cash with tougher penalties to be imposed on gang activity. Drive-by shootings will carry a harsher penalty with a new offense created carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison for discharging a gun with intent to intimidate. Police will also get more powers to search gang members' property during a time of gang conflict. Motorbikes and cars will be able to be impounded for a wider range of offenses to help police tackle convoys. There's also a new power to seize cash up to $10,000 when found in suspicious circumstances. And rules around the trade of high-end luxury items like boats and jewelry will be tightened, prohibiting cash sales. Political editor Jessica Much McCai has reaction. The spoils of gang life. Something the government is vowing to disrupt. We're going after guns, vehicles and cash. The new law changes will mean people won't be able to buy a car, boat or expensive jewels with cash. It'll be easier to impound cars and simpler to seize large stacks of cash. Basically, we want to hit the gangs and the offenders where it's going to hurt. Jail time for drive-by shootings will go from six months to five years. But there's nothing on outlawing gang patches or forcing gang members to show receipts for unexplained wealth. This is a meaningful change. The ability to quickly get in and disrupt across gangs that are warring with each other is going to make a big difference for us. But the mongrel mob told one news today. This is about politics. He has to appease Middle New Zealand. So, you know, this is just a response to Labor falling in the polls, and it's nothing concrete. It's not going to change anything as we see it on the ground. According to the police database, there were 4,400 gang members at the beginning of 2016. That's gone up to 7,700 in April this year. In my lifetime, I can't ever remember the amount of lawlessness that we're currently experiencing as a country. A police intelligence report released to One News show there are 14 licensed premises in central Auckland alone that have gang links where gang members launder money or hand over drugs. I just think that the gangs now operate an environment where they feel that they can, for example, take over public spaces for a patching ceremony. It's the first proper outing for the new police and justice ministers, and they're wanting to send the message they're doing something about gangs. But some experts say it's just fluff and a knee-jerk reaction to increased gang warfare. The government says it won't happen overnight, but these changes will make a difference. Jessica Muchmukai, 1 News. The battle against inflation is heating up with house and food prices on the rise. The Reserve Bank is making what moves it can to rein in the economy, lifting the OCR again today. It's now at 2.5% after a 50 basis point rise, the sixth consecutive hike in a row. It comes as Real Estate Institute figures out today show more signs of a rapidly slowing housing market. While the median house price was up just 4.2% annually in June, the number of house sales are the lowest since 2010, just over 4.5,000 in the year to June. That's a 38% drop on the previous 12 months. Houses are also taking longer to sell. It's now on average 44 days compared to 31 days this time last year. And inflation is continuing to bite into food bills. Stats nz figures show the cost of food is up 6.6%. The increasing cost of groceries such as milk, yogurt and potato chips, the biggest driver. This support the idea that we're going to see a fairly high inflation figure for the June year. So we're expecting 7.1% annual CPI inflation. So fingers crossed, that will be the peak. But it's probably going to be a slow decline inflation over the next couple of years. All right, Katie Bradford's with us now to talk this through. So Katie, why is the Reserve Bank decided to raise the OCR now and by those 50 basis points? Well, Simon, it's all about that word. We're all starting to really hate inflation. It's trying to get inflation under control. This is the third double hike like this we've seen this year. We can probably expect another supersized hike and for those rates to keep going up this year. As you heard from Nick Tuffley there, it's all about inflation. We are expecting the latest inflation figures out on Monday. All the predictions are that it'll be around 7.1% up from the current 6.9. And there are all those global and domestic factors we know about at play there. If you look at what's going on around the world in the UK, inflation's well over 9%. The US is expected to hit just under 9%. So what the Reserve Bank is doing here is acting aggressively. They're trying to stop inflation and betting in. So what happens from here? And tell us a bit more about those other factors that will influence the inflation track. Well, the economy is starting to slow. The Reserve Bank won't have an impact immediately. It will take some time. In the meantime, unemployment remains low. That helps. That keeps the economy going. But we're seeing all those other problems in the labour market. The Reserve Bank today talked about the wave of COVID at the moment, those winter flus and its seasonal illnesses. They're affecting workplaces all over the country. That's starting to impact, plus the numbers of people going overseas. So those may create some short-term problems as well. And what about that other pillar of the economy, the effect on mortgage rates and the housing market? Well, interest rates, a lot of those were already embedded in. This decision was expected today. No one is surprised by it. In fact, there's a lot of competition in the market. Banks are desperate for customers at the moment. And in some cases, we've seen interest rates go down this week. Those house prices have fallen through the floor, really. The market will keep dropping. The Reserve Bank says it's bringing it back down to more sustainable levels. The big question for the Reserve Bank now going forward for the rest of the year is it doesn't want to be too aggressive. It's going hard. It's going fast. It's going early. But if it goes too hard and too fast, that's its balancing act. That's its balancing act. It's really got to work out. Katie, thanks very much for the analysis. We're here for you. That's the message US Vice President Kamala Harris had for Pacific leaders at the regional meeting in Fiji. She backed it up with a multi-million dollar investment promise and sent the assistant secretary of state. But also listening to her speech was Chinese intelligence, underlying the issue that America is not the only big player around. Pacific correspondent Barbara Drever joins us live shortly. First, her report. The United States making its presence known in an unprecedented fashion keen to ensure Pacific leaders know who their real friends are. At a time when we see bad actors seeking to undermine the rules-based order, we must stand united. We must remind ourselves that upholding a system of laws, institutions and common understandings. Well, this is how we ensure stability and indeed prosperity around the world. And it's no secret who the US sees as the bad actors. Before the meeting gets underway, a Chinese intelligence officer stands with the media. After being confronted, he's removed to the back of the room, joining another unaccredited Chinese official. It's for host to determine the way that meetings operate, for them to set the expectation of who's able to access meetings. And once those expectations are set, it's upon us all to follow. The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State's been sent into Fiji to double down on the vice presidents, we are one message. Well, we're a Pacific nation, so I think we think of ourselves as part of this community. And we understand that countries here will work with other countries. We expect that. But we're, I think, determined to be a great partner in the region. Pacific leaders, while keen to see a more engaged United States, also determined to stand together as a region. Some have waxed and waned, but what is constant is that the Pacific charts its own course. And even when there is pressure on that course, that ultimately just means that it's more important than ever that we come together. The US has announced a 60 million US dollars a year for the region pending congressional approval. The Federation States of Micronesia President revealing to one news it's been quite the negotiation. It was going back and forth. There was a disparity in that position. And today it was a very big announcement that all of the Pacific Island countries were happy to receive. The US has been invited to speak here by Fiji, an unusual move showing America has won this round in the geopolitical battle against China. We recognize that in recent years, the Pacific Islands may not have received the diplomatic attention and support that you deserve. So today I am here to tell you directly, we are going to change that. A seismic shift at this Pacific Islands Forum, but it's early days as the region itself still grapples with unity. And Barbara's with us now live. Barb, as we saw, you've spoken with the US Assistant Secretary of State. What's her take on how united the region is? Oh, look, there's no getting away from the fact that Kiribus isn't here and of course the United States has their own reasons for being deeply disturbed at that given that Kiribus borders their territories and is close to military installations. However, what was interesting is the Assistant Secretary of State did tell me that Kiribus is keen to see them set up an embassy there. And they have been engaging with officials. And also the Kiribati is very much part of the Tuna Fisheries Agreement. And so that engagement is in stark contrast with what's happening here at the Pacific Forum, where leaders have not been able to contact President Tarnas Mammal despite all attempts. However, New Zealand and Australia, we're still trying to get in there. We've put in some money to put in a desalination plant, trying to engage those officials. And Kiribas faces a massive drought at the moment. So that desalination plant will be extremely useful to provide drinking water. But, you know, despite that, it's obvious that there is a very, very long way to go to get Kiribati to come back into the fold and it won't be happening anytime soon. And Kiribati isn't the only issue, of course. The Solomons, as we know, has been a problem signing that security agreement with China. Our Prime Minister made some moves on our front today? Yes, well, you know, face-to to face is everything in the Pacific and certainly a very successful bilateral meeting between Jacinda Adir and Prime Minister Manasseh Songavari. New Zealand, Jacinda Adirn did make sure, get the point across that New Zealand would be extremely concerned if the Solomon Islands encouraged anything that might prompt a military presence in the region. Manasseh Songavari said that he has no intention of doing that. It's not in the best interest of the Pacific or indeed the Solomon Islands. So the good ground was made on that. Also, New Zealand is going to extend its policing program in the Solomon Islands for another two years and put in $8.5 million. Now, tomorrow's the Leaders Forum, and that's where the real work will begin, and very frank talking as well. Live from the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, Barbara Dreva, thank you very much. One News understands the government will tomorrow announce changes to make it easier to access free rat tests and masks. It comes as COVID case numbers climb to more than 11 and a half thousand today. That's up from 10,000 this time last week. 29 people with COVID have died in the last five days, taking the seven-day rolling average to 19. However, the Prime Minister says the government's not considering moving the country back into the red traffic light setting. Two people are on the run after a brazen armed robbery at Auckland's Meadowbank Shopping Centre. Police say the pair entered Brownson's jewelers about 1 o'clock this afternoon with a gun, smashing glass cabinets with a hammer before fleeing in a car. No one was injured. A nearby store worker told one news she hit under a counter during the terrifying ordeal. Police are asking for anyone with information to come forward. A man's been charged with murder after a woman was fatally shot in West Auckland last night. Police were called to a house in Henderson about 9 o'clock after reports of gunfire. The woman was found with gunshot wounds. First aid was given, but she died at the scene. Police believe the man charged and the victim knew each other, and there's no risk to the public. The winter storm sweeping the country has turned deadly with police recovering a body from a flooded vehicle. The vehicle was swept away while trying to cross a Ford here at Silver Stream near Dunedin. Two occupants managed to escape, but it appears a third person was trapped inside. Their body recovered this morning. A road that connects travellers to the tourist hotspot of Queenstown is now open again. Heavy snowfall closed the state highway network from Ferry to Twysel yesterday, leaving many travellers trapped in Teckapur overnight. Here's Maddie Lloyd with today's developments. Once the storm stops, the clean-up begins. The aftermath of yesterday's relentless snow scattered along State Highway 8 in the Mackenzie District. You were driving in this yesterday. How did you find it? I was a bit greasy. I got stuck up the hill. I had to get towed out again this morning. This is only about the second time I've seen it this bad, but they do get snow in here a bit, but yeah. Even graders were getting into trouble. Others, using a bit of DIY. Like that snow shoveling was going to be part of your holiday? Not exactly. No, not partly. No, I am. We don't have a shovel. We weren't prepared for it. Many tourists were left stranded here in Tikipur overnight with the roads on either side shut. We're about to fall into the ditch, what he's just said. Let's call it there and drive into town, spend the night. Wait for it to get a bit sunnier. We were originally leaving yesterday. We ended up booking an extra night just because there was so much snow. After hours of work from ground crew, roads were cleared and the State Highway Network reopened. These Aussies back on route to Queenstown, a relief for local ski fields. Last week we had up to 50% of our guests on both mountains and Queenstown were Australians, which was exceptional. They used a lot of our services, buses, rentals, snow sports, and they go downtown and spend money, so great for our community as well. But those in South Canterbury are still struggling. Mountain huts had 50 centimetres across the whole mountain. It's closed today because we've got our patrol teams out, particularly clearing the snow, making sure it's safe and clearing the avalanches. It does make it challenging, but look at the families around. They're just having an absolute ball and we're in the snow business. We'll take the snow whenever we can get it. Spirits are high as the island gets reconnected and holiday travel resumes. Maddie Lloyd, One News. A double-decker bus transformed from diesel to 100% electric is being tested in Auckland this week. The conversion completed in a Masterton workshop as a southern hemisphere first. And as Laura James reports, it could see our public transport meet emissions targets ahead of time. The wheels on this bus going round and round, once powered by diesel, but no longer. These are the big ticket items, so that's your charging point. These black boxes here, here are the batteries. We can charge this bus in probably about 45 minutes. The double decker was three years old when transit decided to give it a makeover. This is the first sort of repair that's been done in the world. I know they're doing one in the UK at the moment. For us to get this up and going during COVID and our guys to do it in Mars. It's a pretty good feat, to be fair. We like to think of it as a big Lego set that's been reconfigured. The bus lives in Wellington where it's already been serving commuters. The bus would leave the depot about 5, 5.30 in the morning, come back to the depot maybe 1, 2 o'clock for an hour long charge and then go out to maybe midnight thereabouts, so 24-hour operation effectively. This week it's being tested on our biggest city's routes, a long journey to get here. So if you compare the trip that we were to do in a diesel bus of the same size, we've saved a ton of carbon. I think we spent about $200 charging, and diesel cost for this bus to get up here will be about $1,200. Transits plan now is to convert all 20 of Auckland's double-decker buses in the next two years. Once they've got the green light, they'll be able to pump one out every two weeks. The 20 are just those operated by transit. In total, Auckland has 200 double-deckers, all running on diesel and many of them relatively new. The reason this bus is here is because we are very interested and we are committed to transition the entire fleet to zero emissions. We anticipated we would have commercially viable double-decker electric bus from 2025 onwards. And here we are. We already have example. It just has to prove that can deliver we'd love to start tomorrow to be fair we've been waiting and we're geared up with the expertise and knowledge to make it happen a conversion costs just over four hundred thousand dollars which makes it competitive to building a new one and the big advantage here is that we're actually pulling a diesel off the road hoping to make diesel's history well ahead of the government's target to decarbonize the network by 2035.

No, my hawkey, my welcome back. Some overseas workers filling critical labour shortages will have few options to guarantee their future when a special one-off visa closes at the end of the month. More than 60,000 migrant workers have already been fast-tracked to residency through the process. Corazon Miller reports. They build our homes, bake our bread and care for our elderly. I organize activities for them. I make sure that they've got something to look forward to in a day. Giving them happy time and making sure that they're okay, giving them the care they need. These aged care workers are among the more than 200,000 that have applied for the one-off 2021 resident visa. Latest figures show most come from India, the Philippines, China and South Africa. They work in roles across health, construction, teaching and primary industries. So far, 60,000 have been approved. I was very happy I called my mom and then she cried and then, yeah, it was a good opportunity for me to study as well again, the engineering. It's like every immigrant's greatest miracle. But as this visa category closes, migrants would lose a key avenue to residency. They're facing massive uncertainty about their future of their life in Alchariwa, and they deserve some certainty about whether they'll be able to remain. Many sectors are struggling to fill vacancies without migrants. It would be challenging times across the aged care and healthcare sector if we didn't have our migrant workers here. There is a new work visa which fast tracks residency for those in hard-to-fill roles, but some like nurses and midwives don't meet the high school's threshold and must wait for at least two years. But others such as aged care workers and builders appear to only be eligible for temporary work visas. For those that missed out, there's no real pathways for them after if they're not in one of the high-paying or short-listed professions. Workers we need but are unable to keep here long term. Corazon Miller, one news. Unhinged and the craziest meeting of his presidency. That's how the mulling over of, quote, extreme ideas for Donald Trump to cling to power is being described. And even more has been revealed at the hearing into the capital riots. Kim Baker Wilson has details. An election result, Donald Trump refused to accept. And soon, others wouldn't accept it either, as the heart of American democracy was stormed. It submerged between those two events, there was afraid, unplanned, oval office gathering. The meeting that would last multiple hours and become hot-blooded and contentious. Called a heated and profane clash between Donald Trump's allies and White House advisors. Who traded personal insults, accusations of disloyalty to the president, and even challenges to physically fight. It was December 18. His supporters came armed with a draft executive order so voting machines could be seized. I was not happy to see the people in the old lives. One of them, Trump's campaign lawyer. Cipollone and Hirschman and whoever the other guy was showed nothing but contempt and disdain of the president. That's Pat Cipollone, the top White House lawyer who walked in on them. Have the federal government seized voting machines? It's a terrible idea for that. After the meeting, a Trump tweet. That would galvanize his followers unleash a political firestorm. Some of that played by the panel today. And now Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to descend on Washington, D.C. Calling on we, the people, to take action and to show our numbers. You're going to be a million plus geeked up armed Americans. And giving evidence someone who took part. You know, the president, you know, got everybody rowed up, told everybody head on down. So we basically just followed what he said. But this hearing ended with an explosive twist. After our last hearing, President Trump tried to call a witness in our investigation. Who that witness is, we don't know. The Justice Department has now been alluded. Kim Baker Wilson, One News. A cruise ship with at least 118 COVID cases on board has docked in Sydney. Despite the operator of the Coral Princess, saying significant COVID safety measures have been put in place, the vast majority who have tested positive are staff. Before disembarking, passengers had to return a negative rat test, with only those testing positive forced to isolate on board. Now, if you've tried to buy flowers recently and thought the price was a bit steep, you're not wrong. Florists say a shortage of blooms is behind the big increases, and they're being squeezed out of the market by larger retailers like supermarkets. Te Aniwa Hu Yanganui reports. Sid Hansen has been arranging and selling flowers for more than 40 years. This has been my life's work. It's been my passion. She recently shut up shop to run her business from home and she struggles with the rising cost of living and of flowers. Immediately post-lockdown, our very first flower auction, it's like 100% increases on some lines, which have now even been exceeded. The price of chrysanthemums at auction went from $12 a bunch to $20 in just a week. But almost every flower is at a premium. During the lockdowns, flower growers were prohibited from harvesting their crops. Those growers lost a lot of money in that process and it's made it difficult for them to continue on. Wholesalers like NZ Bloom import flowers for local florists and face price hikes there too. Prices now of imports are probably about 60% higher than what they were pre-COVID just because of the airfare costs. As a wholesaler, it's certainly limited the range of flowers that we can offer our florists. Competition on the auction floors also contributing to the shortage. We're finding the large supermarket buyers are increasingly swooping in and taking entire lines off the floor. With not enough flowers to go around, florists are losing out. The flower industry, we're really off the floor. With not enough flowers to go around, florists are losing out. The flower industry, we're really running the risk of consumers' gift-giving dollar being spent somewhere else and our flower industry just unraveling in front of us.

A world-famous motorcycle is back on display at Tepapa after being restored to its former glory. The Britain V-1-1000 was hand-built in a Christchurch garage and went on to break world records reaching up to 300 kilometres an hour. One News has been tracking its restoration for nearly a year, as Kate Nicol Williams reports. Dominating at home and overseas. The Britain V-1,000 bike left manufacturers like Ducati in the dust. dominating at home and overseas. The Britain V-1000 bike left manufacturers like Ducati in the Dust, described as a sculpture capable of 300 kilometres an hour. It's different, so people aren't just looking at another motorbike. It looks different, sounds different. Now the bike's been reassembled at Tepapa, after a fresh paint job. These pink fairings are fluorescent once once more as the late designer envisioned. I promised him that I'd be around to look after it and I'm just honouring that commitment. It's been a long time coming. It was 2016 when Bob Brooklyn first came to DePapa and was disappointed to see the bike in a faded state. Regular maintenance is now being discussed. It's not normally what we would do with collection objects, but we felt that in this case, because we had the blessing of the family and the Britain team who were there right from day one, we decided that it was appropriate in this case. The project started in August last year with a restoration team based in Christchurch. The motorcycle's bold colours were inspired by the starfish John Britain bought back from holiday. Bob Brooklyn was told to make it happen. I tried never to disappoint him, so yeah, we succeeded, and he was wrapped, and we went through all the bikes with that system. COVID-19 delayed the refit, but the stripped-down bike remained on display and proved popular. It's fantastic, being able to see, I guess, in naked form and probably just been able to appreciate the engineering a little bit more with the covers been off it. The team feel privileged to preserve one of the country's most famous bikes. Having met John many years ago, you know, he was an infectious guy and it's great to be able to carry on his dream. A dream more Kiwis can appreciate when the Britain goes back on display tomorrow. Kate Nicol Williams, One News. Last night we brought you this stunning image from the world's most advanced telescope. Now more extraordinary photos have been released by NASA, giving the deepest and most detailed view of the universe. The BBC's Rebecca Morel explains how the James Webb Space Telescope works. The beauty of our universe, as never seen before, captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. These are the cosmic cliffs of the Karena Nebula, amidst the dust, stars are being born. This is a new view of Stefan's Quintet, 300 million light years away where vast galaxies are caught in a celestial dance. And the deepest ever view of space, it's teeming with galaxies, some from just a few hundred million years after the dawn of the universe. To have worked on a mission for this long, to be able to finally see it come to fruition, to do what it's supposed to do is just, it's absolutely incredible. The images are amazing. The telescope blasted off last year on Christmas Day, and over the last six months, it's been getting ready for its mission. The James Webb Space Telescope is an engineering marvel. At its core is a six and a half meter wide mirror made up of 18 hexagonal segments, each perfectly aligned to act as a single surface. It also has a sun shield the size of a tennis court to protect it from the heat and light of the sun. The telescope will look back further in time than ever before, showing us the light from the very first stars to shine. We'll also be able to see how they came together to form the earliest galaxies. And it will study other planetary systems, revealing whether life could exist beyond our world. It's almost like a time machine. You're looking back into the far distant past. And so we can begin to answer those questions, such as how did the first galaxies and stars formed? I mean, the hope with this telescope is we see almost in real time, as it were, a history of the universe playing out. The telescope also captured this. 2,000 light years away, it's a star going through its death throes. In some strange way, you know, it's a pretty view of something decaying and dying. But we're able, again, to look at that material as it flows away from the star and understand something about the evolution of the star. But this is just the start for the telescope. Over the coming days and months, more and more images will be captured. Our knowledge of the universe and our place in it is about to be transformed. Incredible stuff. All right. Kim's here with sport now, as you can see, as Wellington gets ready to play host to its biggest sporting event in years. Yes, indeed. The All Blacks Island decider, how pumped are you? Well, Antonians certainly are reminiscent, some think, of the Lions Tour in 2017. So with so much at stake, we pick one of the great rugby brains ahead of the weekend's test. And remember this guy?

The city expecting its biggest sports crowd since 2017 for the All Blacks Ireland to side it this weekend. The showdown brings its challenges, though. Andrew Saville has been doing the rounds in the capital. It might only look like plastic and steel but these seats are gold. We're standing in the temporary seats which clearly means you are back. That's a great sign. For the first time since the Lions Test in FIFA World Cup playoff in 2017, a near 40,000 strong crowd will fill Sky Stadium. Ah, yes, pre-COVID glory days. And before we had a problem called staffing issues. Large amount of illness and some of those traditional workers from international students and backpackers that just aren't available to us in the current environment, your confident staffing numbers will be okay for the test. Yes, we are, yes. Riding the brisk, northerly breeze across the harbour to Oriental Bay, this man and his rugby brain are in overdrive. On the loose forwards, I'd definitely have Barrett at blindside flank. I'd play a centre at centre. I'm one for combinations. I know how important it is. Former All-Black Murray McSead still runs his International Rugby Academy back this weekend at full noise after extreme border challenges. Demand from overseas is enormous. That's about the only thing I'm happy with, Sav, actually. You can probably see the bags under my eyes. It's not my age. It's my sadness. What we have got, though, is a probably see the bags under my eyes. It's not my age. It's my sadness. What we have got, though, is a drop-off of New Zealand players, which is something we have to address. And I don't see that happening at the moment. The key shop window and All Black's victory would certainly help. There's only two things that can influence. One, the referee. And number two is mindset. A different mindset needed for fans on Saturday. We are suggesting that they get here 90 minutes before the match starts. There will be cues. The all blacks can't afford to be late either. Andrew Saville won news. From the Wimbledon semi-finals to the ASB classic. New Zealand raised Cameron Norrie has today been unveiled as the first marquee signing for next year's tournament in Auckland. The 26-year-old was knocked out of Wimbledon by eventual champion Novak Djokovic. And while he now plays under a British flag, he grew up in Auckland's East and the local event remains close to his heart. When I was a kid, I always went to the ASB Classic and watched all the players there and have photos of all the players. So that was where tennis all started for me and where they definitely inspired me to want to play at ATP events. Nori played in multiple editions of the classic before COVID, including a runner-up finish in 2019. New Zealand's Hockey World Cup campaign in Amsterdam is over, going down to favourites Germany in the quarterfinal. The Germans opened the scoring, numerous attempts that followed, saved by goalkeeper Brooke Roberts. Chances for New Zealand to equalise few and far between as finding the back of the goal proved difficult. Just over five minutes left in this one. Is this the moment? Where he winds up and shoots? Looking for reflection again and once again the German goal. Living a little bit of a charm life this time. A final attempt to level for New Zealand by subbing Roberts for an extra player proving no good, Germany with the 1-0 win. COVID has forced Kiwi rider George Bennett out of the Tour de France ahead of this morning's stage 10, where riders had a foot in the east of France for 148Ks but only had to lift their eyes off the top of the handlebars to get views of Italy and Switzerland just over the border. Mountains to climb and obstacles to negotiate on the way to Mont Blanc. Here's Jordan Oppet. Out of the rest day and into the mountains. Nearly 150Ks through some of the most idyllic and remote mountain passes in France. The stage was set. take it away riders. But on any given in the valley, but the kids collide into the morning. Oh my God, my town is coming alive. I'm coming home tonight. I know you're ready for the stars to fly. But on any given stage, you never know what's around the corner. Those of you're just joining us now, the Tour de France has been neutralised for a protest. A group of climate change activists had chained themselves together in the middle of the road. Just 36Ks out from the finish. The leading bunch is breakaway cut short, clocks on hold. We are waiting for authorisations to start again, okay? So please be patient, we're still waiting for authorisation from the police. Eventually the protesters were dragged off the road so the race could resume. The leading bunch allowed to re-establish the gap it had before. Then to the final obstacle, a 20-kilometer undulating grind all the way to the foothills of Mont Blanc. They cruise in towards the finish line. Nick Schultz hits it now. Schultz, the better climber. Magnus Court opens up the gas on the line. Oh, photograph! Magnus Court winning by a bike throw, if that. Just a stage ago, our featured photographer Harry Talbot snapped the Dane in the sky. Well, kind of, but after today, you'd have to say he really is on Cloud 9. Jordan Oppet, one news. Now, stop me if this is starting to sound familiar. Michael Bracewell, with a six, to win a one-dayer against Ireland. Yes, the all-rounder once again the hero in the blank cab's second ODI overnight and not just with the bat. His two for 26 helping restrict the hosts to 216 before a rather frazzled start to New Zealand's innings. And that's how they're going to go about it. Guptil is riddled first ball by Adair. Oh, he's gone as well. He's York first ball. Adair is going wild. Recovery coming in the form of Finn Allen and Tom Latham, who both hit half centuries, before Bracewell put the finishing touches on the chase, icing the three-wicket win. Inviting the big shot from Bracewell. And there it is, beautifully dispatched over Middow. Bracewell finishes 42 not out. He'd also finished with a second straight man of the match award as the black caps wrapped up the series with a game to spare. It's becoming the tour of Never Befores, Ireland dismissing the Moldi All Blacks at the Cakedin last night to again make history their first ever win over the side. An early set-piece try from the Maldi all-bl quickly equalled, the Irish taking advantage of slow reactions, four yellow cards and four tries apiece, a resurgence led by Ruben Love for the Māori coming too late. The island has managed to clear the ball of the kick, and he's picked up by Love, and off he goes, great run down the middle from Ruben Love. He split them open, Caligres is there in support. Lobs are passed back in fear a lot. What a try. Maori Rugby in its best. 30 to 24, the final score as Ireland continue a dominating run that leaves everything on the line come Saturday. One player we haven't seen feature in the All Blacks Ireland series so far, blockbusting winger Caleb Clark, a lingering hamstring injury hampering his full return to rugby. Just making the squad meant for some agonising moments, I sat down with him when the team first assembled in Auckland. Back in black, well, Lyluck at least. Caleb Clark's return to the All Black's environment can be summed up fairly simply. Just happy to be heremed up fairly simply. Just happy to be here now, you know. Because even after an impressive run in Super Rugby this year, the Blues Winger was no guarantee to be in the squad. Handstring issues sidelining him at the end of the season, while an ill-fated stint with sevens means he hasn't played for the A-Bs since November 2020. So we'll let him paint the picture of squad naming day. Warning, it's a roller coaster. We're in the blues meeting room thingy. And then we would always like chair on every blues player that got cord out. And so before me was Finley and when Finley's name got cord out, we were like, yeah, yeah, what I do, yeah. Lost in those chairs, the next name, his. So I'm like sitting in the corner, like, oh, I didn't make it. And I was like sitting next to Roger and like Roger got a name, and I was like, yeah. So I didn't make it. Eventually, he was shown a hard copy. So I'm reading and I'm like, I made it, I remember it. And Rogers next to me he goes, oh gee, you made it? And I went, get off me, I'm going to cry. I'm going to cry. Happy tears for a return despite the frustrations of a long recovery from injury. I never really had an injury so significant where for my position we have to run fast and sort of that's how I did it. So it sort of played a little bit with my mind because I want to push it but then I don't want to get injured again. And this time around, the winger who made such a remarkable impression in the early stages of his All Black's career reckons he's grown up a bit. I was a bit of a kid the first time I made it and All Blacks wasn't the main focus for me this year. My main focus was just to have fun and be with my friends, enjoy rugby again. And I think that's what made me feel like what got me back in a way. An attitude that's got him this far and that he's hoping will eventually lead to that long-awaited return in black. Be good to have him back at some stage. Big day tomorrow. Team naming Thursday for this all-important test this weekend. We'll be right across it. No, I bet we will. Thank you very much, Kim.

Hello, for kids on school holidays, wondering when you're going to get a bit of a break as far as the weather's concerned. Hang in there. We get a little glimpse of high pressure over the course of this weekend, and next week, things are looking much better, but we do have another rainmaker working into the far north of the country, but for some of us today, quite a contrast. Wintery scenes, of course, down south, murky-looking scenes in places, other spots doing really well. Of course, some snow-capped peaks. Very common across parts of the south island and even further north. Moody-looking scenes as well with a decent looking star. Things are improving slowly. That system there, big boom-ranging shape, that's going away. But look at all this stuff brewing in the North Tasman Sea. Main reason why we're seeing stuff going on and just coming to life, the sea is so warm. It's like we're seeing stuff going on and just coming to life, the sea is so warm. It's like fuel. You bring some cold air across it, boom, the cloud comes to life. And when you put the streamlines, the jet stream, see that big bend? That's moisture and energy from the southern ocean. Meeting moisture from North Tasman Sea. Bring it together, mix it around three times. You have another rainmaker. That's the one moving into the far north. You can see how the cloud wisps out. That shows oomph into the atmosphere. What is going on? Next batch of watches are already there across the far north. Anywhere from 30 to 60 millimetres, eastern deranged of the Bay of Plenty heads up for that. This guy slowly going away. Brought another month's worth of rain, actually close to two months' worth of rain to Dunedin as it just sat there and spun its wheels. It's going to go away. Still some leftover showers. Snow level about 6 to 800 metres to the far south. Much of the South Island is fine. Notice through the day. That wet weather doesn't hang about. It spreads all the way down towards the central plateau. The darker bits, of course, heavy rain to many areas. Most of the meat and bones of this is probably going to be offshore, and it's more of a sheared system. What does that mean? A lot of it would probably north and east. And the south island, you'll be spared from that. That's going to go east. I'll show you why in just a second. So it's raincoats through the course of the afternoon of much of north. Yeah, that's how it sets up. Winds will be going more of that east-to-southeast direction, wet old end to the day for shore with those watches in place. Auckland, showers more likely rain for the afternoon, 17 degrees, pick up the wind, anywhere from 10 to 30 millimeters in many places. It's more likely a few spots could see 50 or 60. They have plenty. Central Plateau. Start off okay. Odd little shower, but it's more likely for the end of the day into the evening. That's where we bring in the heavy rain. You see that blob of color there, 13 to 16. Temperature-wise, Torrong, same sort of thing. The day is okay. Increase the cloud by the evening will bring in that rain and 17. Head further east, you aren't too bad for all the most. But Gisbon, you have a rain watch too. That's later in the day. For most, you're fine, you dry. There it is. Coming in at night, the spell of wet weather. It isn't too bad. The way it comes in, these are left over early showers, New Plymouth, down towards Levin. The day is increasing cloud for you, and that wet weather probably spreads to you probably overnight, but just the edge of it, Wellington, fine looking day. Bring some cloud in for the afternoon, get some wet weather into the course of the evening and the nighttime. Teuipunamu isn't a bad looking day. Up towards much of Nelson, towards Kaikora, looking fine. Few showers there west port, 13 degrees. Those are really in the first part of the day. Christchurchase, 12 degrees, you're okay, you're fine, you dry, scattered cloud. And that's the case further east, further west, one or two showers, Greymouth and Hooker Ticker, and looking at things further along, Queensland. Any showers are gone? 8 degrees, few, snow level, as I say, 6 to 800 metres, heads up, of course, for any little black spots on the roads at first. To the far south, still got a few showers. They do do thin themselves out it's not rain all day in vicargle there will be some drier spells here and there didn't need the same sort of thing showers are easing back get rid of those through the day so that lump of rain goes away we improve the day snow level 500 meters then we get to the weekend you're saying well where's the decent weather there it is high pressure trying to give us a glimpse of sorts, but that isn't too bad. That's a quieter day. It's going to be the cold frosty start, probably the coldest night of the week. But, of course, Wellington, guess what? Saturday night gets your extra lay as handy. Of course, Saturday at Wellington, as it looks, could have lighter winds. But we'll see. Way too early in the week for cheerleading, too. It is. We're saving that. Kiorna, much appreciated. All right, it's straight upstairs to Hillary and Jeremy with seven-shov."}
