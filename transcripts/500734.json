But we're back and we're rearing to go and a lot coming up on the show this morning, including New Zealand's great brain drain, the thousands of Kiwis considering a move overseas for better pay, better opportunities and cheaper cost of living as well. Plus Grant Robertson on the government's plans to make Alteirola attractive for skilled workers to come here after 7 o'clock this morning. Plus we are live to Ukraine for the latest as Russia bombards cities across the country. And then a little bit later on in the show I'm heading out to see how our athletes are shaping up just a hundred days out from the next big sporting event That would be the 22 Commonwealth Games coming up in Birmingham later this year 100 days 100 days So stick around for that Zion our sports department's coming out with me So he might make him do a few things Or what we're not about No no no No no Yeah Fair enough His limbs are a bit more something than mine Might make him do a few things.

Anyway, it has just gone 6 o'clock, so he's in Dera with her news. At the Maria, Prime Minister, Jacinda Dern, has touched down in Singapore to begin her first overseas trip since early 2020. A dozen Kiwi business delegates are also travelling with the Prime Minister, including the chief executives on Fontera and Auckland Airport. Singapore is New Zealand's fifth largest trading partner with over $6 billion last year. After two days there, Jacinda Adirn will then travel to Tokyo, where she will spend four days. We walk across live to Singapore later in the program. Now back here in Altheoro, police have finished examining the scene where a man was shot and killed on State Highway 3 on Saturday. A stretch of the highway near Taranaki reopened yesterday once vehicles involved were towed away. 22-year-old Carl's Price was driving in a convoy with one other car and rammed into a stationary police car when his associate was pulled over. Police still haven't revealed if Price was armed when the incident occurred. And the road toll has remained at three as Easter holidays come to a close. A 27-year-old died in a two-car crash on Friday night near Queenstown, while a milk tank driver died in South Canterbury on Saturday. Another person was killed in a fleeing driver incident in Auckland on Thursday. The official death reporting period ended at 6 a.m. Nine people died on the roads last Easter. And overseas, Russian bombardment across several cities in Ukraine has killed at least nine people. Seven of those civilian deaths were in the western city of Leviv after several Russian missile strikes. Moscow says more than 300 targets were hit across Ukraine overnight. The BBC's Dan Johnson reports from LeViv. This is the moment the conflict came closer to LeViv. Missile strikes out of the clear skies of a bright morning, hitting targets right in the city. I saw and heard some of the missiles myself, and I counted five explosions, five plumes of smoke. This is where one of the missiles hit. Local officials say it's a car garage, a tire-fitting workshop, where four people died. Valiya is 70. She lives just across the road. Our windows were shattered. Everybody was frightened. We did not know what to do. We started praying. We did not know whether to stay or whether to flee. We went out. All of us. We did not know what else to expect. The emergency response is still underway here, firefighters trying to put out ablaze. And they say this was a garage fitting tires to people's cars. What has happened in LeViv this morning has really underlined the nature of the threat here in this city, even hundreds of miles away from the fighting in the east. We're told that the missiles were fired from aircraft a long way away and that four targets were hit. Local officials say there were three strikes on military warehouses in addition to the garage. In total, seven people have died in Lviv this morning and at least 11 have been injured. What we see today in Ukraine is genocide, which is purposefully committed by the aggressor who kills civilians. Emergency teams are still at work and they're prepared for more grim discoveries. If anyone needed it, this was an early morning reminder that this country, all of it, is still at war and still under threat. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed Western countries have hurt their own economies with sanctions. Russia has been hit with financial and corporate sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine in February. President Putin spoke to top Russian financial leaders in a televised video call saying the sanctions have led to a deterioration of the economy in the West, while Russia's currency had strengthened. Now we can confidently declare that such policy with respect to Russia has failed. The strategy of economic blitzing proved unsuccessful. I mean rising inflation, unemployment and worsening of the economic dynamic in the United States and Europe and the devaluation of their savings. And now in sports news, Kiwi squash player Joelle King has claimed her second Manchester open title this morning. The world number five defeated her Commonwealth Games rival, England's Sarah Jane Perry, in straight games in just over 40 minutes. Read on. King, ladies and gentlemen. King won the inaugural event in 2019. She told one news a short time ago, winning the Manchester title means a lot to her. It's a pretty special one. I've been through some pretty rough patches with my squash, sort of struggling to find some form. And as of late, it's just picked up. So it's really nice. I've been close semifinal, semifinal, semifinal, to actually win and win a tournament that I've won before. It's pretty special. Go to while. Pressure has eased off Kiwis coach Michael Maguire for the time being as his West Tigers side claimed their first win of the NRL season against the Parramatta Eels. The Tigers led by 10 points at one stage before the Eels made a comeback, tied 20 all with just seconds remaining. Jackson Hastings sealed West the win with a long-range field goal. Well, if it has to, if it comes, it has to be here. For the win, Hastings. He's kicked it. He got it. He got it. Jackson Hastings wins the game. The Tigers winning 2120. So good. And finally, the trailer for Taika Wightzsche's latest film has been released, gathering millions of views in a matter of hours. A follow-up to his 2017 hit Thor Ragnarok. The story follows a title character who's dealing with the fallout from recent Avengers movies as he claims the superhero days are over, but he won't do it alone. He'll be joined by the Guardians of the Galaxy and, of course, Taika's signature humor. Just look into the eyes of the people that you love. Not me. Or love and thunder hits theaters this July. I love that. I was just listening. It's very taika. Like when you, if you watch the whole trailer through, and especially if you've seen Thor Ragdorok, it's just quintessential taika. Yeah, I actually enjoyed that piece one. Yeah, really good. To the second one that's coming out. Also looking forward to heading out and about this morning, well, when I say out and about, I'm heading over to the Millennium Institute, to hang out with some of our Commonwealth Games athletes 100 days, 100 days until Birmingham.

Oh, yeah, no, you too. Yeah, that too. I mean, if being a Commonwealth Games athlete yourself wasn't enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah, true. Well, she's got the lived experience. Yeah, yeah, that's right. How did that go? No, let's not talk about it, shall we? Ready? So, yeah, it's not still not. Tears and it's still raw, right? Just a little. Well, let's move on to the weather then. Let's take a look at how your day is going to look. It's a raw, right? Just a little. Well, let's move on to the weather then. Let's take a look at how your day is going to look, Fetja, it's a wet one. There's a heavy rain warning for Coromandel Peninsula this morning. And that rain could also hit north of Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. Also down south, you were in for some heavy rain overnight and tomorrow morning. And now to the north, this rain is pretty much everywhere here. If you're heading out this morning, you can expect a few showers, some possible heavy and thundery falls. 25 degrees is the height in Kaitai. It's still fairly warm. And it's looking similar through here further down as well. It's cloudy with occasional rainfall. Tauranga, you can expect some heavy falls and possible thunderstorms throughout the day. 21 degrees is your high. And crossing to the east coast, it's a cloudy day for Danubek and Masterton. The rest of you, you're in for some drizzle this morning. 21 degrees is a high if you're in Napier. And over to the west side, it's a pretty fine day here, actually. For Palmerston North, just high cloud for the rest of you. 20 degrees is a high for Wellington. A beautiful morning from Palmerston North all the way down to Wellington. And crossing the Cook Strait, it's a lovely, paki, fine day for Kaikouras. You will get some cloud rolling in this afternoon. But everyone else is going to have a gorgeous morning. Blenheim, your high is 24 degrees. And further south, this morning will be a bit foggy for you if you're in Canterbury, but that fog should lift for a nice fine day later on 21 degrees as a high for Alexandra. Pretty much a beautiful day for almost everybody. And in the deep south, here it's a bit of a mixed bag. And we do have some warnings, I think, on the west side as well. Fine in Queensland, Dunedin, cloudy with a few showers around Milford Sound and in Vicago. You're going to get some heavier rainfall overnight, though. 20 degrees is a high in gore. Thanks, Indira.

Last month, as the war in Ukraine was unfolding, we heard here on breakfast about an imminent global food crisis. With a crucial portion of the world's wheat stuck in Russia and Ukraine, prices went soaring. And it's now compounding the food shortage in East Africa. World Vision East Africa Regional Director Joseph Kamara is joining me this morning to explain and give us a bit of an update of how things actually are in East Africa. Morning, Joseph. Thank you so much for joining us. Can you, I guess, first of all, just describe how things are in East Africa, how urgent the situation is there? Good morning, May. Thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about the crisis in East Africa. As you know, East Africa has been experienced significant effects of droughts, back-to-back droughts for the last three cropping seasons that have resulted into massive food insecurity. Before that we had desert locus that we experienced about a year or more, and one have been ongoing devastated over 5,000 hectares of cropland. And then, of course, we have had conflict that have been underlying the situation in East Africa, causing 11 million people to be displaced as internally displaced within their countries. And then, of course, about 4 million people as refugees crossing from one country to another to seek refuge. So all those factors added together, plus, the after effects of COVID-19, which caused a meltdown of global supply chains, made it impossible for the region to recover. Such has gone down in the Arbisandas, as if that's not enough, the Russia-Ukraine crisis in SARS, driving all of a sudden fuel prices going high over the roof and of course the price of food also increasing. As you know, oil is the backbone of transport, food growing in rural areas and different places to be transported to market areas for access to other populations that I need. But of course, the problem of because of high global fuel prices, the cost has been transferred, passed on to the consumer. So transportation costs have made access to food becoming more difficult because of expensive. Food has become more expensive. But that's not all. The actual fuel is becoming a problem in this region, for example. I don't know if you've been to Kenya, those who know, the viewers who know Kenya would understand this better. Right now in Kenya, we are experiencing fuel crisis. We have to line up to get fuel. And sometimes you have to line up overnight to get fuel. I think it was the day before Easter, on Thursday before Good Friday, we're lining up the whole night to just get enough fuel for the rest of the week. So this is making it extremely difficult. This region imports 44% of its wheat from both Ukraine and Russia. So right from Djiboutis, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Eritrea, Burundi, we import all added together, 44% of wheat from Russia and Ukraine. And as you know, which military analyze most of the food we eat, for example, bread. And those who know the flat bread, recall chapati that is eaten widely in this region is made out of food. So that makes it quite challenging. That's not all. You know, Russia produces natural gas, and natural gas is one of the components that make up, they use to make fatlizers. So the price of fertilizers have gone high high and it's not going to be accessible. All the imports from Russia are into this region are not going to be available because of course of their prices. So we are not looking at recovery soon. This is going to be a long haul. Right now we have 31 million people facing a food crisis, serious food crisis. And of those about 9 million are one step to farming life conditions over almost 600,000 are in farming like conditions across the region so we have a serious crisis on our hands. Gosh Joseph it is a perfect storm of everything happening, isn't it? The conflict that's happening in Ukraine, there's been COVID-19, we're talking climate change, all of those things are having an impact on food security there in East Africa. I've got about a minute and a half left, Joseph. So I guess my final question to you is about the humanitarian response by the rest of the world. What is it? And this is two parts, I guess. One, what do governments around the world need to do? But also, down here in Altaeroa in New Zealand, if those who are watching want to help, how can they help? There are many, thank you. There are many ways to help. And I would say it's almost getting late. The window of opportunity to change this is closing. Very soon, unfortunately, we will start seeing people die. It's that bad. We already seen very, very bad images, but because of the Russia-Ukraine crisis that has dominated the news, the world is not going to get to see what's happening here. But that window is closing. There is no more time. We actually need to act now. World Vision has been mounting a humanitarian response to help provide food, provide water, health issues that emerge out of lack of water, address all those issues. But we don't have enough resources. The UN doesn't have enough resources. Russians that have been giving to refugees and other disgrace people are being cut because there is not enough food. Wildlife food program is in a huge shortage of resources to meet the needs. So we urgently need to act first and foremost with emergency assistance right now. Governments all over the world need to look at this as a crisis that we don't need to act first and foremost with emergency assistance right now. Governments all over the world need to look at this as a crisis that we don't need to regret after. So unfortunately, this is happening in the 21st century, today, 2022, when we are starting really badly starting to death. This shouldn't be happening. We need to ask now before I guess what. Joseph, I cannot thank you enough for being the voice for those who don't have a voice in this crisis. And I guess for those who are watching, if there is something that you want to do, head to the World Vision website to see what is actually required or how we can help. Joseph, thank you so much for your time this morning. Cannot thank you enough, Joseph Kamara, World Vision, East Africa, Regional Director. Thank you and take care. Thank you for being our work. And let's go now to Ukraine where Russian forces have launched a full-scale assault on the country, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south. Associated press reporter Philip Crowther is in Levevevevee, a city which had largely remained a safe place up until recently. Philip is with us now. Hi, Philip. What's the latest? Hi there. Well, the very latest is that we're actually hearing air raid sirens right now as we speak. So we might keep this a little bit shorter than usual. We heard those air raid sirens also relatively early this morning. And it was actually during that period of around an hour and a half, during which time we had to shelter as much as we possibly could before getting the all clear. It was during that time that those missile strikes actually happened just a few kilometers away from where we are right now. Those were four Russian missile strikes according to the Ukrainian authorities that hit three military targets here in the city of Leviv, but also one that clearly wasn't a military target. That was a car repair shop. We went to see it earlier today to see the destruction there of burnt out cars, burnt out buildings. And that is where seven people died earlier today. 11 people injured at least three of those still in critical condition, according to the local authorities. And this was a reminder as well for this city of Leviv, which is a relatively peaceful place, as strange as it sounds, and certainly feels like it, because it hasn't been attacked very often. Today was only the second time that we saw black plumes of smoke over this city for about an hour after those military targets and that car repair shop were hit. This would have come as a shock to people here, many of whom, many of the people we see and meet here, are actually people who have come to this relatively safe part of the country from eastern Ukraine, where, of course, things are a lot worse than they are here. Yes, Philip, I've been watching your Twitter posts, and you really appreciate the updates and the photos that you've been posting. They're really pretty devastating. There are still hundreds and thousands of families trying to leave Ukraine. Is there any update on whether there will be safe passages open for them to do so? Now, I'm afraid the news on that front is not good. We get an update on how many humanitarian corridors will be established every day. We get that from the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister and this morning there was that message that you don't want to read if corridors will be established every day. We get that from the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, and this morning there was that message that you don't want to read if you or a civilian wanting to get out of several cities, and it was simply that there would be no evacuation routes opened up during the next 24 hours because there was simply too much Russian shelling to many Russian attacks on those corridors. Remember that these evacuation routes, they only work with local ceasefires, only if Russia and Ukraine agree that they're not going to attack each other, and that just hasn't happened. And that's why there were no possibilities for civilians to get out in that way, at least. In the past, there have also been trains that have been able to get people out of cities in eastern Ukraine to places precisely like this one for people to feel safer. And here's hoping that there will be some open tomorrow. There has been a demand from the Ukrainian government, actually, for Russia to agree to humanitarian corridors tomorrow. Speaking of those trains, by the way, that get people to safety, while we're at that car repair shop, it actually stands at the top of an embankment, which leads to a train line. And while we were there, we saw a few trains pass through. One of them came from the city of Nipro and was just about to arrive here in Leviv. Nipro is a city just west of the Donbass region, where there is expected to be a large-scale Russian offensive any time now, essentially. So that train would have been pretty full of people who wanted to get to a safer place as well. And there they were going past the scene of another deadly Russian missile strike. Philip, we really appreciate your reports coming there from Lviv, and we do hope that you can stay safe in the meantime. Philip Crowe that Associated Press correspondent, thank you for joining us tonight. And this morning here in Aaltero, we will be right back with more in your 630 news.

Welcome back to breakfast. We've got in Dera and your 6.30 news coming up shortly. But before that, we wanted to hear from you because just after 7 o'clock this morning, we're talking the brain drain. And it's big. And there's a lot of people, of course, who are expected to head overseas in the next few months, especially those younger people who have put off obviously doing their OE and traveling overseas because of the pandemic over the last couple of years. It's funny, isn't it? Because when our border is closed at the beginning of the pandemic, everyone was talking about a brain gain and we had so many New Zealanders coming back to New Zealand with amazing skills. And now we're seeing people head out at the first chance. Totally. There's predictions that this coming brain drain could be at the levels seen in about 2011 when the big mining boom in Australia happens. So we wanted to hear from you. Are you planning on leaving in the next few months or year possibly? Where are you going to go? Why are you leaving? Let us know, breakfast at tvnz.com.n.z. We're chatting to a couple of people who have already made the decision to leave just after 7 o'clock. And then we'll be catching up with Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson just after 7 o'clock as well to talk about how we retain people here and what we need to do, especially with the high cost of living. But right now, it's just gone 6.30. Here is Endera with your news. Zhao Shang Hao. In her first international trip in two years, Prime Minister Justin Adirn has arrived in Singapore. Ms Adirn is travelling with a dozen Kiwi business delegates for trade talks, including the chief executives of Vontera and Auckland Airport. Singapore is New Zealand's fifth largest trading partner worth over $6 billion last year. After two days there, Jacinda Adirn will then travel to Tokyo where she'll spend four days. We'll cross live to Singapore later in the program. And the search will resume today for a missing fisherman off the coast of eastern Bay of Plenty. The man identified on social media as Jason Kowta did not return from a fishing trip and was reported to police on Sunday afternoon. It's believed he had a white chili bin, red tote tank, wooden oars and yellow life jacket on board his boat. Police are asking Bay of plenty residents from Torere in the east to Makitu in the west to report any of these items if they wash ashore to the 10-5 number. And overseas, Russia has intensified its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, missile strikes killing seven people in the western city of Lviv. They are the first civilian deaths to be reported from the city, which until now has remained largely untouched by Russian forces. Moscow claims more than 300 targets were hit in Ukraine overnight. Associated press correspondent Philip Crowther says air raid sirens are still continuing. Those were four Russian missile strikes according to the Ukrainian authorities that hit three military targets here in the city of Leviv, but also one that clearly wasn't a military target. That was a car repair shop. We went to see it earlier today to see the destruction there of burnt out cars, burnt out buildings. And that is where seven people died earlier today. Eleven people injured at least. Three of those still in critical condition, according to the local authorities. And Russia's invasion is threatening a global food crisis with Ukraine's wheat stocks targeted, preventing exports. Ukraine and Russia are responsible for nearly a third of the world's wheat exports. World Vision East Africa Regional Director Joseph Kamara says it's now compounding the food shortage in East Africa. Right now we have 31 million people facing a food crisis, serious food crisis and of those are about 9 million, one step to farming like conditions. Over almost 600,000 are in farming like conditions across the region. So we have a serious crisis on our hands. And now in sports news, the central pulse have delivered the magic, a crushing defeat in Rotorua. Accurate shooting from Alia Dunn and Tiana Mituaro, helping the pulse to a 13-goal victory over the Waikato Bay of Pentee sign. The 59-32 wins seized the pulse to third on the table. Thank for us. We were focusing on our critical moments this week and trying to be really specific in training and trying to get the most out of it. So I thought we did a really good job and I'm just proud of the girls just tonight's effort. And the Boston Marathon has returned after the pandemic forced a cancellation in 2020 and a delay in 2021.

And taking a look at your weather this morning, there is a heavy rain warning for Coromandel Peninsula this morning. That rain could also hit north of Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. Down south you're in for some heavy rain overnight and also tomorrow morning. Now to the north. Definitely today. Pack an umbrella if you're heading out this morning. You can expect a few showers. Some of those showers will be heavy and thundery. If you can see then, Fittiyanga, at 25 degrees is high in Kaitaya. Warm temps though. It's looking similar through here. You'll have cloud with the occasional rainfall. Tauranga, that will be heavier falls for you this morning. And you can expect some possible thunderstorms throughout the day. 21 degrees is your high. And crossing to the east coast. It's a cloudy day here for Danavik and Masterton. The rest of you will be in for a bit of drizzle this morning. At 21 degrees is a high if you're in Napier. And over to the west side. It's a bit better here. It's looking fine. It's a fine day south from Palmerston North. And just some high cloud for the rest of you, 20 degrees, is the high for Wellington. Beautiful morning there. And crossing the hook straight. It's pretty beautiful out here too. Fine day for Kaikoda. Some cloud rolling in this afternoon. 20, for the rest of you. Actually, 21 degrees is the high in Nelson. Kikoda, you're going to have a gorgeous day all round. 20 degrees is your high. And further south, if you're heading out this morning on the road in Canterbury, you will be seeing some fog there, and that should lift for a nice fine day later on 20 degrees as a high in Christchurch. A beautiful morning from Ashburton all the way down to Warmu, 19 degrees as high for all three cities. And in the deep south, it's picking mix here. It's fine in Queensland and Dunedin.

That's your Thursday night here on one. Welcome back to breakfast. Restrictions have loosened. COVID cases are dropping, and it feels like we might just about be in the clear of the Omicron outbreak. But in fear of speaking too soon, we thought we'd better check in with the experts. Here to share how we're tracking is COVID-19 modelling Altearo's Dionne O'Neill. Morena, Dian. How are you doing? Not too bad. We're just having a fascinating chat in the break because I just all of a sudden thought, you've obviously been spending a lot of the last two years doing COVID modeling. But we were talking about what it is that you guys used to do before COVID came along. Yeah, So before COVID, my research area was looking at networks and processes that happen on networks like spreading processes. And so I guess February 2020, I realized pretty quickly, look, if we can make a network that describes the interaction of New Zealanders and we can put a spreading process on it that looks kind of like the spread of COVID. Then we're in a good place to actually have a decent model of how we might expect things to play out with COVID spreading in Aotearoa. And here we are. And here we are. Two years later. Exactly. Did not think it was going to be a two-year job. No. I did not think it was going to be a job. It started off. It was my colleagues in the physics department basically covering my teaching in order to free up some time for me to do this. So how concerned were you when this Omicron wave came along? Because of course the modelling in terms of how we tracked in New Zealand was reasonably well, especially when you compare us to the rest of the world. But Omicron was a different beast, right? Yeah, and Omicron was scary because it's so much more transmissible than previous variants. And we'd banked a lot of our response, I guess, in terms of getting that protection from spread from vaccination. And Omicron, we learned pretty quickly was going to evade that vaccination protection, or at least with only two doses and with some waning thrown in the mix. We knew that the timing was about right for boosters to play a big role. And it really turned out it was really important that month or so when we managed to keep Omicron out of the country for a little bit longer so that we could get people boosted. And that probably helped a lot. That meant we had people who were recently vaccinated. And sure, Omicron does still try and evade that boosting vaccination a little bit, but not nearly as much as if you'd only had two doses and they were wane. So that was scary. And at that time, also, we didn't know so much about what the severity was going to look like. And on Omicron, we knew it was going to be mild relative to Delta. But when you've got really high case numbers, that can still turn into a lot of people going to hospital. Because I guess it's the thing, right? Modeling is not an exact science. In some regards, it's a little bit of crystal wallgazing. Of course, you're using best information that you have available to you, but a lot of it is just predicting what might happen. So what were you predicting when the Omicrona outbreak occurred? What were you thinking, how bad did you think it might get here? So we knew we were going to get tens of thousands of cases. It was going to look nothing like previous cases when we had Delta here. So, yeah, we knew tens of thousands of cases were on the cards. The bit that's really hard to predict is how people going to respond, what's their behavior going to be like? So with this network model we've got, we can say, well, if these businesses are closed and or these industries have worked from home or these schools are behaving in this way, we know what consequences that will have on cases. But we don't know what people are going to do in response to seeing case numbers hit 1,000 per day for the first time. And so if people see that and go, I've been told I'm Crohn's Miles, I don't care, I'm just going to carry on with my day-to-day life, then that makes it, that sends case numbers one way. And if they say a thousand cases a day and go, that seems terrible. I really want to adjust my behavior. I'm going to do a whole heap more than I'm required to. I'm going to actually keep myself safe, not just follow the minimum restrictions or the minimum protections, then that can send cases another way and slow things down. So that's the bit that's really tricky with modelling that. How are people going to respond to what's happening? I was looking at some of the predictions, the modelling that you did last year. Worst case scenario with 90% vaccination coverage of our total population predicted around 15,000 hospitalisations in 1,800 deaths. Best case was about 310 hospitalisations and 37 deaths. We've obviously fallen somewhere in the middle of that, right? Yeah, yeah. And things like deaths and hospitalisations, again, that really depends on who gets infected. So where those cases show up. So we know if you have this many thousand cases, if those cases are amongst people who are a lot more vulnerable, more of them are going to end up in hospital. If those hospitals are overcapacity and don't have a bed for those people, more of those potential hospitalisations can turn into death. So really details do matter around it's who's getting infected in what situations. If all of those cases are showing up in Auckland at the same time, compared to if they're spread around the country, that affects capacity. So how are we tracking, do you think? So we are tracking roughly like we'd expect with the modelling. In terms of hospitalisations and deaths, we do look roughly like what we'd expect, partly from modelling and partly from looking at other countries around the world. Yeah, part of it is people have been, and some of that's been a little bit lower than what it might have been. That's been people doing sort of more than the minimum. It's people being a little bit cautious. So people have been good, I think, about trying to reduce their risk, protect others around them. And at least until that shift from red to orange, there were people wearing masks and situations where it was recommended but not required. And sort of that general looking after those around you, and that has helped with things a bit. So we've come off a little bit better than we might have. Yeah, on the other hand, we're at a plateau now. COVID's not going away. No. Stick around in the community at about the level it's at, or at least in Auckland at the moment. Some other regions still taking some time to come down off those peaks to this sort of plateau. Yeah, and I guess the big thing is at the moment, you know, this whole messaging of we're open for business, we're accepting tourists now back into the country, we're in this orange setting, as you mentioned. So how concerned are you about where we could go as restrictions start to ease? Right, so a lot of that's going to depend on people's behaviour. So at the moment in Auckland, in terms of what our daily cases are, we look about as safe as we're going to get. So this is mostly looking at what's happened in similar places to Aoteiro overseas. We expect cases after that first wave plateau at about 1,000 cases per day, per million of population. So Auckland's down in that plateau now between 1,000 and 1,000 and 1,500,000. And once the rest of the country joins Auckland on that plateau you'll expect maybe 5,000 cases a day and we sit there until something changes and so that could be people changing their behaviour and deciding hey I'm really familiar with this I'm I don't need to wear a mask anymore didn't get sick last week won't get sick this week or I've had it once I'm not going to have COVID again for a while I'll yeah be a little bit more relaxed. The other things that will drive this will be coming into winter. Just like every other respiratory illness out there, like colds and flus that we're so familiar with, case numbers are going to go up in winter. Respiratory illness when they're stuck inside, it's cold and damp. And then the other thing that will play a factor in what happens from here is waning immunity. So just in the same way that our protection from vaccination, or with vaccination wanes, your protection that you've got from previous infection, that also wanes. And while we don't have much data on that yet, it hasn't been long enough to really see what that's going to do, we expect that's going to wane at a similar speed to what that vaccination protection is going to wane at. And so that means around that sort of maybe for that part, late winter, early spring, you've got some of that waning protection there. Maybe that's combined with that seasonal effect of winter, and maybe it's combined with people's behaviour and that relaxation. So that sends case numbers back up again. And so other places around the world are seeing second waves and third waves of when you've got COVID in the community. So I guess the big thing is vaccinations, of course, we've seen, and not getting too complacent, especially as we start to open back up again, right? Yeah, absolutely. So it's still that thing of particularly as well protecting the people around you. So you might say, hey, I'm young, I'm healthy, I'm relatively low risk, but you don't know what the person who you're going to infect is going to be like, what are their circumstances or what's the person who they subsequently infect? So it's that, yeah, looking after people when you can, stop the spread whenever you can. Great message. And we love it. Thank you so much for coming in, Dea.

The countdown to the Birmingham Commonwealth Games is officially on With 100 days to go Some of our top athletes are celebrating In Auckland's AUT Millennium this morning And also among them is our very own Commonwealth Star Superstar Jenny Mae And what in is us I'm not sure about star Or superstar the game star Superstar Jenny May and what in is us? I'm not sure about star or superstar and it was a few haircuts ago sorry I'm just getting in my cup of tea this morning but yeah we're here at AUT Millennium a big day here actually or big morning because some of the athletes are coming in and out of here as we celebrate 100 days until the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, which is the 21st edition of the Commonwealth Games. So just, Eiffa, 2002 was when I went to the Commonwealth Games. And we're not talking about what happened. We're not talking about what happened there, okay? But it was a privilege. And I guess the other part to this morning to note too is that a lot of these athletes selections haven't actually been done yet, so they're still to get through that entire process. Anyway, one of those athletes who debuted last year for hockey is Sam Hi-ho, who joins us the morning. Morena. Kiyara, how you going? Yeah, good, really good. So in terms of build-up towards this cometh, hang on, mate, so I'm just going to turn this music down. Sorry, this is what happens when you're out live. Okay, no, there we go. Anyway, Sam, sorry, Sam. Yeah, so how has the build-up been until this point? I mean, we're still 100 days out. So how are things been going? It's been really good. We've been focused pretty hard since the start of the year after selection camp on turning our eye towards Com Games and getting ready for selection for that and ready to perform at our best for that. So yeah, being pretty hectic, but I'm really starting to build up and hit our stride. Yeah, in terms of Commonwealth Games, I mean, I don't know. What are you? 22? 24. 24? Okay, so in terms of Commonwealth Games, it's always been, I mean, the Olympics, obviously the hockey is at the Olympics, you get your world champs. But in terms of Com Games, is that always or been something that you've aspired to head to? Yeah, absolutely. Com Games is huge, like such a massive privilege to be able to represent a country in any form, but at a major event like the Commonwealth Games would be an absolute privilege. Yeah. For sure. So in terms of the training then you talk about a selection camp. Is that been or is that coming up? Still coming up. The selection's kind of a process over quite a few months so we're just about to head into our North First South series so that'll be pretty competitive domestic comp with the team and also later on we're going to be having a series versus Aussie to kind of build up and help that selection process as well. In terms of the coaches I don't know what it's like in hockey, whether they have conversations with you about what you need to work on for selection, etc. Do you have those conversations? Yeah, absolutely. We have individual performance plans, so we meet pretty regularly with the coaches however often you want about what you need to work on, what your strengths are, what you want to focus on in your game, keeping touching base kind of weekly on what your focus points are, how you're going to work on that and how you're going to ultimately get selected for the Com Games. I mean, again, it's 100 days away. The games itself, that's the opening ceremony. But selection, when do you find out about that? The actual date hasn't been finalised yet, but I imagine it'll be sometime in June. Yeah. What does the family think? They're pretty excited. Everyone's got to book their tickets pretty early, I guess. They're going to get pretty booked out, so they've booked hoping. So, yeah, but they're pretty proud and excited that I'm even in the mix. So, yeah. Very cool. And have you been to Birmingham before? Has any of the Fano ever been up to the UK and Birmingham in particular? Some of the family's been around to Europe. I've never been personally, so that'll be a huge step and pretty exciting, but I've never been personally with some of the family have. Well, it's exciting times ahead. Anyway, thanks, mate, because I know that you've only just arrived, so you've been pulled in here for this morning's interview, but thank you. And hey, and all the very best also for selection. So we're hanging out with some of the athletes this morning. And I'm going to get Zey on actually to do a few of things because this is what this morning is all about, is actually getting some of the media along to do some of the sports, some of the events that our athletes will be competing again at the Commonwealth Games. I'm too old for that stuff now. My body's... Oh, come on. I'm sure you remember it like it was yesterday, sis. My niece... Oh, no, no, no. The mind is willing, Indira. The mind is willing. It's just that the body isn't so much these days. Anyway, we're going to be hanging out here all morning, so we'll catch up with you. Hayden Wald, our Olympic bronze medalist. He's going to join us a little bit later on this morning as well. Brilliant. And you'll put Zion through on this morning as well. Brilliant. And you'll put Zion through his paces as well. Looking forward to that. Thanks, Jame. Enjoy the morning. She says the mind is willing but the body isn't. I'll tell you what, though, out of all of us, she is by far the fittest. Plus I know how competitive she is as well. And that. Hey, thank you as well for your feedback. Just after Endera's news, we're talking brain drain because a lot of you are thinking of leaving. High cost of living, high rents, unable to buy houses in this country. There's a lot going on. That's the kind of feedback we could... Exactly, and a lot of reasons to leave as well. And a lot of you were thinking about it. Danielle, Australia, most likely Brisbane, I would head to, higher pay, lower cost of living, cheaper housing, warmer climate, close enough to New Zealand to come home to visit. And that's the sentiment echoed by a lot of you. And so we're going to chat to a couple of people who have made that decision to head overseas and we'll be putting some of those concerns of people to Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson just after 7 o'clock this morning as well. How do we retain people? How do we keep them in this country? We'll talk about that throughout the morning. Keep sending your feedback in as well. But right now it's just gone 7 o'clock. Here is Indira with your news. Kiyahana, the Easter holiday road toll has risen to four. Police have just confirmed one person died in a single car crash in Dunedin last night. On Friday, a 27-year-old man died in a two-car crash near Queenstown, while a milk tank driver died in South Canterbury on Saturday. Another person was killed in a fleeing driver incident in Auckland on Thursday, but it is a significant drop on last year's nine fatalities. And police have reopened a stretch of State Highway 3 after finishing their scene examination of a fatal shooting. Vehicles involved were towed away from the Taranaki scene yesterday afternoon. 22-year-old Carl's price was driving in convoy with one other car and rammed into a stationary police car when his associate was pulled over. Police still haven't revealed if Price was armed when the incident occurred. And almost a week since New Zealand shifted to the orange traffic light, there are fewer cases than expected. That's according to one COVID-19 modeler. There were 6,242 new cases yesterday. Dionne O'Neill says the public's behaviour has helped. There were people wearing masks in situations where it was recommended but not required and sort of that general looking after those around you and that has helped with things a bit so we've come off a little bit better than we might have. Prime Minister Dacinda Adirn has touched down in Singapore to begin her first overseas trip since early 2020. A dozen Kiwi business delegates are also travelling with the Prime Minister, including the chief executives of Fontera and Auckland Airport. After two days in Singapore, Jacinda Adirn will then travel to Tokyo. We shall spend four days. Singapore is New Zealand's fifth largest trading partner, worth over $6 billion last year. We will cross live there in just over an hour. And Russian missile strikes have hit cities across Ukraine, killing at least nine people. Ukrainian authorities say seven civilians died when missiles hit the western city of Leviv, which has largely escaped attacks until now. There were three strikes on military warehouses as well as a car garage where four members of the public died. What we see today in Ukraine is genocide, which is purposefully committed by the aggressor who kills civilians. Seven civilians had plans for life. Today, their lives have ended. And as Russia intensifies its attacks, civilians trapped in besieged areas of Ukraine won't be able to evacuate for two days with humanitarian corridors in the country shut. This morning there was that message that you don't want to read if you or a civilian wanting to get out of several cities and it was simply that there would be no evacuation routes opened up during the next 24 hours because there was simply too much Russian shelling to many Russian attacks on those corridors. Remember that these evacuation routes, they only work with local ceasefires, only if Russia and Ukraine agree that they're not going to attack each other, and that just hasn't happened. And today marks 100 days until the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, and Kiwi squash player Joelle King has celebrated in style, claiming her second Manchester Open title. At the world number five, defeated her Commonwealth rival, England's Sarah Jane Perry, in straight games in just over 40 minutes. King won the inaugural event in 2019. She told One News, winning the Manchester title means a lot to her. It's a pretty special one. I've been through some pretty rough patches with my squash, sort of struggling to find some form. And as of late, it's just picked up. So it's really nice. I've been close semifinal, semifinal, semifinal to actually win and win a tournament that I've won before. It's pretty special. Amazing, Joal King. You are amazing. Let's take a look at your weather this morning. It's quite a wet one further up in the north. And as you can see here, there is a heavy rain warning for Coramandel, Peninsula this morning. That rain could also hit north of Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. And if you go further down south, you are in for some heavy rain overnight and tomorrow morning there as well. Now heading to the north, as I said, definitely today is the day you want to pack an umbrella or stay home if you can. Heavy rainfalls this morning and afternoon. In Fittianha, you might get some possible heavy and thundery storms as well. 25 degrees, though, it is a high in Kaitaya, Russell Fangare in Auckland, you're looking at 24. It's looking similar through here as well, cloudy with occasional rainfall, Tauranga, that will be heavier for you this morning, some're looking at 24. It's looking similar through here as well. Cloudy with occasional rainfall, Tauranga, that will be heavier for you this morning. Some possible thunderstorms too throughout the day. 21 degrees is your high. And crossing to the East Coast, here it's a cloudy day for Danubek in Masterton. But for the rest of you, you will definitely get some drizzle this morning. 21 degrees is a high if you're in Napier, 23 in Masterton. Now over to the west side. It changes a bit here, which is quite lovely. It's a fine morning from Palmerston North, all the way through to the capital. Just some high cloud for the rest of you. And some rain this morning in Tameranoi, New Plymouth, light possible showers. Fonganui, you're going to have a beautiful afternoon today. 23 degrees is your high. And crossing the Cook Strait, light possible showers. Fonganui, you're going to have a beautiful afternoon today. 23 degrees is your high. And crossing the Cook Strait, it gets better. Pretty fine day if you're in Kaikora, some cloud rolling in this afternoon for the rest of you with a beautiful morning everywhere from Blenheim all the way down to Hokitika. 20 degrees is a high in Greymouth and Hokitika. And further south, if you're in Canterbury this morning, it is foggy. But that fog will lift for a lovely fine day later on. It's a pretty good patch here. This part of Altearoa, 21 degrees is high in Alexandra. You will also get as low as 5 degrees today if you're in Alexandria. And in the deep south here, it's a mixed bag. Queensland, you're going to have a lovely fine day. The rest of you, you've got cloud hanging about. Rakeha to Stewart Island that will get a bit heavier with the rain later on in the afternoon. 17 degrees is your high. Thanks, Indira. It's coming up seven minutes past seven. Our borders are opening. Restrictions are loosening. After two years, New Zealand is emerging from its pandemic isolation, which means for many of you, the big OI is back on the cards. We've been hearing a lot from a lot of you who are planning on leaving in the next couple of years. Government officials estimate 50,000 Kiwis will leave over the next year, but that number could swell to as high as 125 hundred and twenty five thousand. Those numbers are super concerning as we face in the exodus of skilled workers. Joining me now are two New Zealanders who are ready to go right at Ali Benj and mental health worker David Coffey. Mordana you two, thank you so much for joining us, really appreciate it. Mornina. How have the last couple of years been for you? It's obviously been a ride for everyone, but how have you two found it? It's been pretty intense. So we met 2020, so our entire relationship's been pandemic. It's been interesting. Yeah, it's been fascinating. But one thing we often talk about and think about is what a distinct experience we've had in Altaeroa as well with everything. Yeah, it's fascinating. Absolutely. That's quite the courtship over the last couple of years, though, in the midst of a global pandemic. But things are obviously going well for you because you've made the decision to head off overseas, right? We have. Yeah, no. We sort of late last year, late last year, mid-last year, as we're flat out, I think we're in the latest lockdown. And we're kind of thinking, what do we want to do next? What's next for us? And we started looking online and fantasising and dreaming about the future and we're looking at the costs of things and we're like this is doable we can do this. Waiting up our options between staying here taking on a million dollar debt or going overseas and Barcelona in London. Yeah. And that's the reality right. The cost of living here is huge. It's very, very tough if not impossible for a lot of people to get on the housing ladder at the moment. But this started, am I right in thinking this started as just an idea of a trip initially? You were looking at possibly going and staying in an Airbnb in Barcelona. Yes. And we realized that we would be paying significantly less in Barcelona than we would here. So it's really just a logical next step for us as a couple. If we wanted to live together, it's cheaper to move to Spain. And do a bit of travel at the same time and, yeah, enjoy ourselves and see the world. And I think especially after two years being in New Zealand, which has been a great time, it's really exciting to go out and see the world and things. Absolutely. And no one would begrudge you that, but was it a tough decision to make? Not really. No, it wasn't particularly tough. We've always wanted to travel. It's just that for the last few years it's just not been possible and now it finally is again. So he sees their opportunity. And I think, you know, seeing a lot of the media stuff and things around the, some of the concern around brain drained and things like that. And for us, we've thought about it. It's like, I think we're like many Kiwis before, is we want to go and take what we value and as important to us as New Zealanders out into the world. And we want to gain, you know, experience, knowledge and skills there. And obviously, hopefully, one day bring it back to Otero and contribute that here as well. You mentioned the tough housing market and how hard it is to get on the housing ladder in this country, the property ladder. What were some of the other factors that were kind of driving your decision to leave? Well, it was just that our options were so limited. Like it was either take on that huge debt or spend all our savings on paying rent. And if we wanted to travel, then staying any longer in New Zealand would use up all the money that we could spend travelling. So it was kind of either leave now or one or the other. Yeah, leave now or be trapped here with a huge debt that would be really difficult to pay off. And both are perfectly valid, but right now in our lives we've chosen experience and to see the world over housing. And should that be the way in a modern Western society and democracy? I don't think so. Yeah, it's hard, right? It's hard to build a life in this country for a lot of people. Yeah, it is. I mean, we're really lucky. I mean, we, you are talking to two people with full-time jobs who are educated and things like that. We're lucky to have options., we're really lucky. I mean, we, you are talking to two people with full-time jobs who are educated and things like that. We're lucky to have options. So we really want to probably, we should acknowledge that as well. Absolutely. But, yeah. Yeah. And David was saying yesterday that the cost of living in New Zealand is really on par with the biggest centres in the world. So, and, you know, the cost of living crisis is a global crisis. Yeah, absolutely. And so we just thought, if we're going to be paying the same rates... Why not do it in London? Yeah. Or Barcelona. Or Barcelona. Yeah, exactly. Or Paris. Absolutely. Absolutely. The world literally is your oyster right now, which is fantastic after a couple of years of lockdowns. We're going to be chatting to the Deputy Prime Minister after the break. Is there anything you'd like to put to him or ask him? So there's one thing I am curious about. At the end of last year, we had the student mobility visa, was part of the discussion for the free trade agreement with the United Kingdom and it was supposed to mirror the Australian one. However, since we've had a little bit of more of a concern around the potential brain drain and things like that when it was announced that that free trade agreement was signed, there's not been any more follow-up or communication on the change in that visa, which effectively went to 35 as opposed to 30, and moved it out to, I think it was four to five years. So I'd be very curious about what's happened with that, with the changing political context. Whether that's an indicator of that political anxiety around the brain drain. Well, we'll certainly ask him. All the best you two. When are you off? 27th, so next week. Next week. Yeah. We have told our jobs. It's a stereotype. Yeah, this isn't an on-air resignation or anything. No, no, no, no. Okay, great. Hey, well, all the best you do. We really, yeah, and God, you're not the first people to leave to go off and explore the world. So we really wish you all the best, but hopefully we see you back on these shores in the not too distant future. Yeah. Kiyon-a-Maddy. Thank you so much. That's Ellie and David, about to head off overseas. All the best you two. Cheap. Right, stay with us. A massive brain drain, as we've mentioned, is the last thing we need right now. So what is the government doing to help? Find out next when Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson joins us. But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all? And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you've been here before? They're there for the very first moments. Congratulations. The miracle of birth is never lost on me.

Today's breakfast brewer is a hugely popular, wonderfully rich, strong and full-bodied, Dilma English Breakfast. Blood Fate. Welcome back to breakfast. It is 18 minutes past seven. We're looking at the issue of brain drain this morning, with government officials estimating at least 50,000 New Zealanders will leave over the next year to travel overseas. And with the world opening up again, who can blame them, especially if it makes economic sense as well? We realised that we would be paying significantly less in Barcelona than we would here. So it's really just a logical next step for us as a couple. If we wanted to live together, it's cheaper to move to Spain And do a bit of travel at the same time And yeah, enjoy ourselves and see the world And I think especially after two years being in New Zealand Which has been a great time It's really exciting to go out and see the world and things And well, it's fantastic that New Zealanders can finally embark on their OEES again, we are looking at a huge loss of skilled workers. So what is the government doing to offset that loss? Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Grant Robertson is here to tell us. More than our Minister, thank you so much for joining us. How are you? Kiela Mati, good, thank you. Happy Easter. Happy Easter. I hope you had a fantastic long weekend. This is big though, right? Kiwi Bank reckons people immigrating away from New Zealand will outnumber immigrants arriving in this country by 20,000 this year. That's huge. Yeah, there's a lot of different views on that. The Reserve Bank have actually said that over the course of the next 18 months to two years, what we call net migration, which is the result of people going in and people coming out, will actually reach about 24,000 positive. So that's yet to be seen. But no doubt, there are a lot of people who've been wanting to get off on their OE getaway overseas. That's something New Zealanders have done for decades. It's just for the last couple of years they haven't been able to, and there's a bit of pent-up demand there. But we're still confident that a number of people will want to come and live in New Zealanders have done for decades. It's just for the last couple of years they haven't been able to, and there's a bit of pent-up demand there. But we're still confident that a number of people will want to come and live in New Zealand, and we're working hard to make sure that those opportunities are there for them. Yeah, and we'll talk about those opportunities shortly. But are you concerned? I mean, with the numbers that we were talking about in the introduction there, this could rival the big mining boom back in 2011 to Australia. How concerned do you as a government about that brain drain? Well, as I say, I don't think we can prevent New Zealanders from leaving. People have gone off on their OE for decades and the vast bulk of those people come back to New Zealand because they want to come back and raise their families here. And so we certainly aren't going to be, you know, at the airport stopping people from going. What we've got to do is make sure that there are good jobs for people to come back to in New Zealand and that we're making sure we use not only the immigration system to bring people in, but also make sure we keep training people. It's one of the reasons why we offered free apprenticeships and, you know, give people those opportunities to have the skills that we need here. But it will be a balance. New Zealand's always relied a bit on immigration coming in, and we will be doing that over the next few years. Yeah, but it's tough, right? Because, you know, as you mentioned, we're very familiar with young New Zealanders going off on the OE, but you would have heard in our introduction, David and Ali, who are in their mid-30s, who usually we would expect to be kind of putting down roots in New Zealand, who are in their mid-30s, who usually we would expect to be kind of putting down roots in New Zealand, who are instead saying, I can't buy a house in this country, the cost of living is huge, I can live in Barcelona, for God's sake, cheaper than I can live in Wellington, why would I stay, why would I live here? And that's concerning, concerning that people feel like they can't build a life in this country when they should be. Yeah, look obviously people feel like that, you know, we keep a close eye on that kind of thing. The truth is that right around the world people are facing up to massive inflation increases much larger than we've seen. If you go into Europe, you've got an average up around 6, 7% in terms of inflation in some countries higher than that, 8% in the UK. So everybody's facing these cost of living increases. And I do understand, as I think as David said at the end of that, you know, after two years, which he said, it's been great in New Zealand. It was time to see the world. What we've got to do is make sure that there are good quality jobs here, good quality housing here for them. We didn't build enough houses as our population grew. You know, Maddie, New Zealand's population grew from 4 to 5 million across about 15 years, whereas it grew from 3 to 4 million across 30 years. That halving of the time there, unfortunately, wasn't accompanied by a house building program or a road or public transport building program. We're now building those houses, but it takes some time to catch up with the deficit that we've got there. On the job side, we really are pushing into how we can get higher wage jobs here. That means investing in research and development and skills and all the trade agreements that we do. So these things don't have easy answers, but we are pushing in to make sure that there's a reason for them to come back to New Zealand and make their lives here. I'm thinking, though, of those companies that are really going to feel it, really going to feel the brain drain, a lot of companies who've really struggled during COVID, I'm thinking of hospo and retail, those businesses are really going to struggle now with their usual workforce heading off overseas. How do you offset that? Yeah, and look, a big part of that is things like the working holiday scheme, and so we started that off early in terms of our reconnecting with the world. We brought forward where people could become in for their working holiday visas, and actually the truth is there have been a big part of our hospitality workforce, particularly for some time. The Prime Minister is currently offshore in Japan and Singapore, and one of the things she's talking there is about things like working holidays to make sure we've got people coming in. We've got our 2021 visa to regularise the status of a whole lot of people who have been here. And as that reconnecting process continues over the rest of this year, that's where we get that inward migration, which, as I say, the Reserve Bank and others are now predicting will actually offset those who are leaving. Yeah, although, as we've mentioned, and I know we're not alone in facing this issue, but we've got a huge cost of living crisis. We talk about it constantly here on breakfast. People really struggling to pay the bills and get by. We've got skyrocketing inflation, including the highest annual rise in food prices in more than a decade. What is driving that here on our shores? Yeah, look, a big chunk of that is the fact that we have export prices for our food. So New Zealand produces a lot of food, but obviously that's what we sell to the world. And so a lot of the time New Zealanders end up paying that export price. We've got big fuel increases, and so the cost of filling up your car is actually replicated in terms of the cost of fuel for both producing the food, but also transporting it around New Zealand. We've got big supply chain constraints. So the stuff that we import into New Zealand costs more because there aren't enough ships and there aren't enough containers. This genuinely is a global phenomenon. And then the war in Ukraine came along and just propelled that to an even worse situation. So it is tough. I absolutely acknowledge that for many families. And it's the reason why we made that big package on the 1st of April to particularly support low and middle income families. And it's why we cut the 25 cents a liter off the fuel excise duty just to relieve a bit of that pressure. But this is a genuine global problem. And one in 100 year economic shock out of COVID, inevitable that we're going to be affected by it. Absolutely. Although a big part of our inflation is non-tradable, it's generated here in New Zealand. And we're looking at tens of billions of new money pumped into our economy over the last couple of years. That's on you, right? Well, I think it's really important to remember what we use that money for. That was what paid for the wage subsidy scheme, which helped people stay in work. And now we've got 3.2% unemployment. We supported small businesses through the resurgent support payment and the small business cash flow scheme. We bought the vaccines. That's what we use that money for. And I think New Zealanders are pleased that we've got through COVID with relatively limited health impacts, relatively limited economic impacts up till now. But unfortunately, when we move into this high inflation environment, this is what happens. The government does its bit through making sure that we spend carefully and wisely. The Reserve Bank's job is the other side of the equation, and that's obviously why interest rates are going up because they are now trying to bring inflation back down. So unfortunately it's part of the cycle that we're in now, but these rates of inflation that we're seeing now obviously are spiking up by later in the year into next year. Most people are predicting that they'll come down again. We so appreciate your time. Minister, thank you so much for joining us. That is Graham, Bobson, the Deputy Prime Minister, joining us in part because the Prime Minister is overseas right now, which we'll be catching up with a little bit later on in this show.

Dilma English Breakfast. Dobrohoranku, here is your 730 news. The Western Ukrainian city of Leviv, which has largely escaped attacks until now, has been hit by the Russian missile strikes. Seven people were killed, the first civilian deaths to be reported from the city. Moscow claims more than 300 targets were hit in Ukraine overnight. Associated Press correspondent Philip Crowther says air raid sirens are still continuing. Today was only the second time that we saw black plumes of smoke over this city for about an hour after those military targets and that car repair shop were hit. This would have come as a shock to people here. Many of whom, many of the people we see and meet here, are actually people who have come to this relatively safe part of the country from eastern Ukraine, where, of course, things are a lot worse than they are here. And the brain drain could well be upon Aaltera as our border restrictions loosen and Kiwis look abroad for opportunities. Estimates from within government predict 50,000 people could leave the country within a year. But it could swell up to 125,000 as young New Zealanders' book delayed Oeys. A writer Ali Benj is among them and says the rising cost of living meant staying in Altheoro would have limited her options. It was either take on that huge debt or spend all our savings on paying rent. And if we wanted to travel, then staying any longer in New Zealand would use up all the money that we could spend travelling. And Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says the government is looking at ways to attract skilled workers here to make sure pressure is lifted off sectors which could soon lose key staff. And so we certainly aren't going to be, you know, at the airport stopping people from going. What we've got to do is make sure that there are good jobs for people to come back to in New Zealand and that we're making sure we use not only the immigration system to bring people in. And police have finished examining the scene where a man was shot and killed on State Highway 3 on Saturday. A stretch of the highway near Taranaki reopened yesterday once vehicles involved were towed away. 22-year-old Carl's Price was driving in convoy with one other car and rammed into a stationary police car when his associate was pulled over. Police still haven't revealed if Price was armed when the incident occurred. And the search will resume today for a missing fisherman off the coast of eastern Bay of Plenty. The man identified on social media as Jason Cowder did not return from a fishing trip and was reported to police on Sunday afternoon. It's believed he had a white chili bin, red tote tank, wooden oars and a yellow life jacket on board his boat. Police are asking Bay of Plenty residents from Torreira in the east to Makitu in the west to report any of these items if they wash ashore to the 10-5 number. And the central pulse have delivered the magic a crushing defeat in Rotorua, accurate shooting from Alia Dun and Tiana Mituaro helping the pulse to a 13-gold victory over the Waikato Bay of Plenty's side. The 59-32 win sees the pulse to third on the table. I think for us, we were focusing on our critical moments this week and trying to be really specific in training and trying to get the most out of it. So I thought we did a really good job and I'm just proud of the girls just a night's effort. I thought we did a really good job and I'm just proud of the girls just a night's effort.

We've been focused pretty hard since the start of the year after selection camp on turning our eye towards Com Games and getting ready for selection for that and ready to perform at our best for that. So yeah, it's been pretty hectic but really starting to build up and hit our stride. And finally, the trailer for Taika Whitechiti's latest film has been released gathering millions of views in a matter of hours. A follow-up to his 2017 hit Thor Ragnarok.

He'll be joined by The Guardians of the Galaxy, and of course, Taika's signature humour. Just look into the eyes of the people that you love. Not me. What? It's just listening. Thor, Love and Thunder hits theatres this July. And taking a look at your weather this morning, here's how your day is going to turn out. There's a heavy rain warning for Coramandal Peninsula this morning, and that rain could also hit north of Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. Further down south, though, here you are in for some heavy rain overnight and tomorrow morning. And now to the top of the country, it's pretty wet today if you're heading out this morning. You can expect a few showers, some possibly heavy and thundery. 25 degrees is a high for Kaitai, and it's still feeling pretty humid. It's looking similar further down as well. You've got occasional rainfall here. Tauronga, you can expect heavy falls and possible thunderstorms throughout the day. But despite that, Met Service recommends just one layer of clothing today because you're still going to feel the humidity a bit as well. I think it's looking about 80% humidity level this morning, 2% precipitation. So 21 degrees is your high. And crossing to the East Coast. And here you're going to get cloud in Danubeck and Marston, and the rest of you will experience some drizzle this morning at 21 degrees will be the high in Napier. And over to the west side, it's a fine morning here from Palmerston North all the way through to the capital. Just some high cloud for the rest of you. And 20 degrees is the high in Wangen, uh, the Fanganui Atara, Wellington. And crossing the cook straight into the South Island, it is a parky fine day here. If you're in Kaikoda, you've got some high cloud rolling around in this afternoon. 21 degrees is your high in Nelson. Kakota, your high is 20 degrees, and you'll get as low as 8 today. A further south, it's a foggy morning in Canterbury, but that fog should lift for a lovely day later on. 21 degrees is high in Alexandra. Ashburton, you're looking at 19 degrees as you're high. And in the deep south, it's pick and mix here. Fine in Queensland for a lovely day today. 17 degrees is your high there. But like you to Stuart Island, you will get a few showers and they'll be a little bit heavier in the afternoon. 17 degrees is your high. Thanks, Endera. And thank you for your feedback as well. We really appreciate it. A lot of you telling your stories of leaving New Zealand in the next few months or a year. Haley, my partner has moved to Perth to work in the minds. We just cannot get ahead in New Zealand despite both working full-time jobs. So me and the kids are still here and we don't know when we will see each other again. Sacrifice now, she said, for a better future. And we're hearing the same sentiment across the board. It's not a whole bunch of Kiwis that want to go over for overseas experience or an OE, although that might play into it. But it's really that people are looking at the cost of living here. And their salary differences, Jesse is saying she's a teacher, she can earn 45% more in Australia than she can in Al-Tero. And of course, it's upsetting to leave a fauna but with the higher cost of living this is a sacrifice they're willing to make. Absolutely and Shan says it's quite sad but the reality is they're making the move for financial reasons. The biggest indicator is the housing market. They all have fauna who will help them on their feet until they are established. And I think that's the big thing, right? Cost of living is really high here. People are really struggling to get on the housing market. So like you said, yes, we always will see people heading off on their OEs. It's a real Kiwi thing, especially after two years in lockdown. But a lot of these people, like Ali and David, who we caught up with, people in their mid-30s who would usually be putting down roots right now in this country, but have decided to up sticks instead. So thank you. Thank you for sharing your stories and keep sending them in as well. Breakfast at TVNZ.com.

Welcome back to Change We keep on waiting Waiting on the world to change Welcome back to brief us at 17 minutes to 8th We're off to Kaitaya now Where a battle is brewing Over road speed Unhappy with State Highway 1 70km per hour speed limit A group of locals have taken matters Into their own hands And replace the signs with 50 kilometre ones We're joined now by some of those Campaigners, including Far North District Councilor Mati Radich. Morning Amati. How you doing? Morning, Madi. Very good, mate. Good. And I know you've got a couple of other people there with you as well. But tell us about that stretch of road. Tell us about where you are. Well, it's a highly industrial road, Maddie. It's, you can hear the traffic at this very moment. Yeah. Yeah, it's a dangerous stretch of road and something needs to be done about it. And the good news, Maddie, is that I got a email from Steve Mutton from NZTA last night at half-past eight to saying that they are looking at putting up 50K signs outside the two bus companies in this area here. That's Richies and Harrison's Cape Rehanger Tours. And also a 60K just north of Kada, Wallace Road, and this will go up for consultation on the 17th of May. Right. And it looks like it's going to be, yeah, it's all going to go ahead, finally. Fantastic. Because you mentioned it's dangerous and I can see a lot of cars going past you this morning. How dangerous can things get there? Well Maddie we're in an area where there are 40 businesses and 360 workers come into this area every day. So you can just imagine the amount of traffic that's coming in and I'm standing in an area where it's 100Ks. Wow. That's how ridiculous it is. So 100K is behind you and I'm standing in an area where it's 100Ks. Wow. That's how ridiculous it is. So 100K is behind you, and I can see the 70K sign as well, which still seems pretty high for an industrial area like that. It certainly is. You know, you go north from Kaitai here, and there's a township, O'Anoo. They've got a 50K zone, and that 50K zone goes for 1.9 kilometres. And there's actually no one in that town. Yeah. Yeah, that's how ridiculous it is. So you've been a bit of a rebel, Maddie, right? Well, you've got to be a rebel, Maddie, to get results, I'm afraid. And we've been mucked around by NZTA. I've been fighting this for three years, and I've got Murray Harrison on my left. He's been fighting it for 15 years. Wow. And it's just gone on deaf ears. It's pretty bad, really. Murray, I'll bring you in. You can hear me, right? Yep. Yeah, what's can hear me, right? Yep. Yeah, what's your big concern, Murray? We have a tour business, Harrison Cape Runner tours. We take up 12,000 people every year, and we have those people turning off this main road into our yard, and it is that dangerous, as you can hear now, people are trying to turn into our yard to park, and they can't believe it. They can't believe the traffic is going so fast. So there's been a lot of near misses, there's been a lot of crashes here as well. And I've done the towing for 50 years, and I've picked up a lot of vehicles in this area over those years. So, yeah, I'm very concerned now. And that's why I started campaigning a long time ago, but I couldn't get anywhere. And now I've got a lot of support with the councillors and the businesses. And it's great. So at least something's happening now. And, of course, we had to be rebels and put up a 50K a 50K sign, to make everyone realize Steve Muppen come up like a rocket. Once we put the 50K sign up, this one here. So, yeah. You got it there? Yeah. Yes, I can see it. It's very professionally made as well. Yeah. Yeah, and we're still prepared to put up signs until something, I can say it's very professionally made as well. Yeah. Yeah. And we're still prepared to put up signs until something is done. Yeah. So, and we've got ourselves into trouble over it too. I must say. I bet. I have you. We've had to do. How many times have they been taken down? Four times, in it? Yeah, four times. Four times. Right. But you're prepared to keep going, right? You're prepared to keep putting them back up. Yeah. Yes, until they acknowledge something has to be done. Now, what I'm saying is there's still much in us round. 50K signs should be from the first intersection coming into Kaita, which one business has a hundred people going in there every morning. Another business would have 80 going in there, and there's about another 10 other businesses there, smaller businesses. So just at that one intersection, it's a bottleneck. And there's trucks and logging trucks coming out of there. There's everything coming out of there. So there's so many near misses now. And of course they're trying to say, we've got to have 60Ks there into Kaitoa, which is only 500 metres. And then you've got all the Richies buses. You've got... What's the other one there? Fulton Hove. Yeah. There's main freight. They're all coming off this main road. Yeah. It's very busy. And then they're trying to... Then they're trying to tell us that we... They'll start the 50k sign outside my place, which is another 50 meters along. It's crazy. It should be 50, the sign at 50 at first intersection coming into Kaidaa. But Madi, it sounds at least like there is some movement, like you're being listened to, which is fantastic, right? Yeah, you're dead right, Mattie. But I'm still worried. I'm very disappointed with NZTA, as I said to you before. This should have been done at least two years ago. And there's a bit of light showing now from Steve Mutton, and I'd like to thank him for that. And we'll just see what happens after the 17th of May. We'll keep following this story, and we love that you've been a bit of a rebel there in Kaitaya. So keep doing what you're doing. And I'm not sure who's behind you, Maddie, but shout up to the supporters that have been supporting you as well. Yeah. Yeah, thanks very much, Maddie. Thank you. Appreciate it. And thanks, Murray. Really appreciate your time this morning. Yep. Thanks, Madi. All right, coming up, it is a goodbye to diplomacy over Zoom. We're live to Singapore as the Prime Minister's first trip in two years kicks off. But first... Morninga, kiyokota, thank you, kato, yeah, timing is everything.

There's a little voice inside us. That says you're done. You're not built for this. You can't go on. But there's another voice. It whispers. Then it roars. I'm not done yet. Are you? Rexona It won't let you down I'm doing you from I'm joining you from the AUTMILITY I'm joining you from the AUT Millennium Institute on Auckland's North Shore. Now, this is the facility where a number of our elite athletes train. We're talking about our Commonwealth Games, athletes. We're talking about our Olympic athletes. And we are here because it is 100 days now until the Commonwealth Games begin in Birmingham and the UK. And joining me now is one of our hopeful athletes, who's hopefully heading off to his third Commonwealth Games. That is pretty remarkable. Liam Stone. Thank you so much for joining us. How are you? Yeah, thanks for having me. No, awesome. This is so cool to be a part of. And like you say, third Commonwealth Games, I can't believe it. I'm a little bit concerned about Olivia Newton-John playing in the background as a number of people are warming up. But anyway, the last two, talk to me about the last two years, because you haven't actually been competing in diving at all. I mean, you know, we've had COVID, but actually this is due to injury. Yeah, so kind of 2020, I had a run of injuries. I broke my foot, and then I hurt my back quite significantly and so you're right you've got a mic on I was just being the mic in front of you and yeah so it kind of forced me to stop all training for best part of 18 months or just over and so I miss Tokyo but looking back at it now it's kind of been a bit of a blessing in disguise because it's just allowed me to completely reset and come back to the sport with a whole new perspective and just absolutely loving it. And to be honest, kind of diving better than ever in a way. Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? Because we were talking about how long you've actually been diving, right? And so you made your debut at 17. Yes, yeah, yeah. It's your first Commonwealth games. Yeah. But no doubt there were years before that where you were pushing yourself as a teenager doing a high performance training, etc. So this break, I mean your body's probably gone, yeah. It really has. It's just said thank you. Like for a number of years after Rio, things were up and down, and I think I was experiencing quite a bit of burnout, as I'm sure most athletes do. And so this kind of forced rest was quite eye-opening, actually. Like, just I never would have rested that much if I didn't have to. But it's been, yeah, so good for my body. No, I know that you've already met the qualifying standards. There's another couple of events, another one this weekend, for you to, I guess, just maybe make some improvements, go through the motions of actually thinking about what you're going to be doing potentially in Birmingham. But this is your third Commonwealth Games. What is that like to be, and I guess not only as an athlete, but just as a person heading along to the Commonwealth Games, like are there things that at a Commonwealth Games that blow you away and blow you away still? Oh, yes. I mean, the biggest thing I remember, especially my first one, just going into that opening ceremony and seeing the crowd and it was just like, wow, you know, this is amazing. And we were talking about it before, you know, in the village you got crowd and it was just like wow you know this is amazing and we were talking about it before you know in the village you got the food hall was just unlimited food you can imagine it's crazy and going around the village you know we i remember the games room and they had all the new technology coming in the VR and stuff like that and we got to fly that out and such a cool opportunity to just be exposed to all this stuff for this set period of time. Awesome, yeah. The other thing that we were talking about, we got about 30 seconds before we have to wrap things up, but the other thing we were talking about is that this isn't a sport, diving's not a sport, that is sponsored, right? So, mum and dad have been a huge support of yours over the years, which has allowed you to do what you do. Yes, they have. Yeah, mum and dad have been incredible with supporting me and, you know, all friends and family, all very, very supportive. And I couldn't do it without them, so I appreciate that so much. All right. Well, hey, congratulations on the qualifying part and hopefully heading to your third Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and all the very best too as you build up towards July. Thank you so much, Liam. It's been a pleasure talking to you this morning. Really, really appreciate it. Stay with us. Coming up after 8 o'clock, we are going to catch up with Hayden Wilde, our Olympic bronze medalist. He'll be heading off to the Commonwealth Games. Things are a little bit different. He's trying to qualify for two events. We'll tell you about that, as I say, just after 8 o'clock. But right now, here is Endera with your news. Thanks, Jameh. Salamant Bargi, police have confirmed one person died in a single car crash in Dunedin last night, bringing the Easter holiday road toll to four. On Friday, a 27-year-old man died in a two-car crash near Queenstown, while a milked tank driver died in South Canterbury on Saturday. Another person was killed in a fleeing driver incident in Auckland on Thursday. It's a significant drop on last year's nine fatalities. And in her first international trip in two years, Prime Minister Jacinda Adirn has arrived in Singapore. Ms Adirn is travelling with a dozen Kiwi businesses, business delegates for trade talks, including the chief executives of Vontera and Auckland Airport. Singapore is New Zealand's fifth largest trading partner worth over $6 billion last year. After two days there, Jacinda Adirn will then travel to Tokyo where she'll spend four days. We will cross live to Singapore and political editor Jessica Much Mackay. We'll be speaking with us shortly. In almost a week, since New Zealand shifted to the orange traffic light, there are fewer cases than expected. That's according to one COVID-19 modeler. There were 6,242 new cases yesterday. Deion O'Neill says the public's behavior has helped. There were people wearing masks and situations where it was recommended but not required and sort of that general looking after those around you and that has helped with things a bit so we've come off a little bit better than we might have. And Russian bombardment across several cities in Ukraine has killed at least nine people. Seven of those civilian deaths were in the western city of Lviv, after several Russian missile strikes. Moscow says more than 300 targets were hit across Ukraine overnight. The BBC's Dan Johnson reports from Lviv. Moscow says more than 300 targets were hit across Ukraine overnight. The BBC's Dan Johnson reports from Lviv. This is the moment the conflict came closer to Lviv. Missile strikes out of the clear skies of a bright morning, hitting targets right in the city. I saw and heard some of the missiles myself, and I counted five explosions, five plumes of smoke. This is where one of the missiles hit. Local officials say it's a car garage, a tire-fitting workshop where four people died. Valiya is 70. She lives just across the road. Our windows were shattered. Everybody was frightened. We did not know what to do. We started praying. We did not know whether to stay or whether to flee. We went out. All of us. We did not know what else to expect. The emergency response is still underway here, firefighters trying to put out ablaze. And they say this was a garage fitting tires to people's cars. What has happened in Lviv this morning has really underlined the nature of the threat here in this city, even hundreds of miles away from the fighting in the east. We're told that the missiles were fired from aircraft a long way away and that four targets were hit. Local officials say there were three strikes on military warehouses in addition to the garage. In total, seven people have died in Lviv this morning, and at least 11 have been injured. What we see today in Ukraine is genocide, which is purposefully committed by the aggressor, who kills civilians. Emergency teams are still at work, and they're prepared for more grim discoveries. If anyone needed it, this was an early morning reminder that this country, all of it, is still at war and still under threat. And Ukraine says Russia has begun its new offensive in the east of the country. Moscow has tried to break through defenses in Luhansk and Harkiv regions, according to the United Nations Security Council. Four people have also been killed after Russian shelling hit Ukraine's eastern Donyx region. And now in sports news, Kiwi squash player Joelle King has claimed her second Manchester open title this morning. The World No. 5 defeated her Commonwealth rival England's Sarah Jane Perry in straight games in just over 40 minutes. King won the inaugural event in 2019, as she told her one news. She gave it her all. You know, as you get older, when you hit over 30, that you start to have a few questions about, you know, physically, am I still good enough? You know, is there still more improvement I can make? And I think I've been really lucky that I've had some really key people in my team that have just supported me the whole way through. And King is one of many Kiwi athletes coming into form with 100 days to go until the 22 Commonwealth Games. The sporting event kicks off on the 28th of July in the English city of Birmingham. At a countdown event in Auckland, a diver Liam Stone told breakfast he's looking forward to his third games. I mean, the biggest thing I remember, especially my first one, just going into that opening ceremony and seeing the crowd and it was just like, wow, you know, this is amazing. And pressure has eased off Kiwi's coach Michael Maguire for the time being as his West side Tigers, or sorry, West Tigers side claimed their first win of the NRL season against the Parramatta Eels. The Tigers led by 10 points at one stage before the Eels made a comeback. Tied 20 all with just seconds remaining, a Jackson Hastings sealed West the win with a long-range field goal. Look at this. Well, if it has to, if it comes, it has to be here. For the win, Hastings. He's kicked it. He got it. He got it. Jackson Hastings wins the game. Amazing. The Tiger is winning 2120. I love that. Let's take a look at your weather this morning. We are starting off with a heavy rain warning for Coramandel Peninsula this morning, and that rain could also hit north of Auckland and Bay of Plenty. Down south, you are also in for some heavy rain overnight and tomorrow morning. And now heading to the north, it's a wet day here. If you're hitting out this morning, take a raincoat, an umbrella umbrella you want to be prepared because especially if you're in Fittiyanga that rain is heavier possible heavy and thundery even 25 degrees is a high in Kaitaya and it's looking similar through here you've got cloud and occasional rainfall Tauranga you can expect some heavy falls and possible thunderstorms throughout the day, but it's still fairly humid. You're looking at 80% humidity level today. 21 degrees is your high. And crossing to the East Coast, here it's a cloudy day for Danubek in Masterton. Everybody else is in for some drizzle this morning. 21 degrees is a high if you're in Napier, 23 in Masterton. And over to the west side, it's a pretty fine morning here, from Palmerston North, all the way down to the capital, the Funganoi Atara. Just some high cloud for everybody else, though, are 20 degrees is the high in Wellington. 23 for a lovely afternoon in Fonganui. And crossing the cook straight, it's a pretty pucky fine day for Kaikoda. We've got some cloud rolling in this afternoon for everyone else. Blenheim, right now it's about 10 degrees. But according to Met Service, it feels more like 7 degrees. The recommendations today are to wear something windproof. 21 degrees is your high in Nelson. In further south, there is fog to start the morning in Canterbury. That fog should lift later on for a lovely fine day. 21 degrees is the high in Alexandra. And in the deep south, Queensland, you're going to have a beautiful day. 17 degrees is your high. Milford Sound, you are starting up with some showers this morning. Rukia to Stewart Island, it's about 14 degrees there right now. The UV risk is pretty low today, but even with a cloudy day, I'd say the sunscreen is still worth it if you're hanging outdoors for a long time. And Gore, 20 degrees will be your high today. Thanks, Indira. You're welcome. The windproof temperatures. Yeah, definitely. Hey, we've got some really interesting feedback coming in, but I wanted to read this one, which is actually going to add some balance to the conversation. Deborah, who says her and her husband came back from Australia in 2020, sorry, during the pandemic after living in Oswald for 15 years. She's saying here, they were burnt out out and stressed they just needed to come home. But now their jobs are secure. They've got great secure jobs. She's got a job that pays more than she was getting paid in Australia. Her husband is earning almost double here what he did in Australia. And one thing we did forget as well, the minimum wage here in New Zealand is higher than Australia. Australia has youth rates, so up to the age of 19 years old, you'll get at least $10 an hour less than an adult worker. So, as she says, people will go as they always do, but others will be coming back because Amy says home is the best place on earth. Absolutely, and the grass is always greener, right? And also, we're expecting it. We expect people to leave. The OI has always been a big part of New Zealand culture, and especially after two years in lockdown, there will be a lot of people wanting to head off overseas. I guess the conversation, though, is around how do we get people to come here from overseas, so how do we entice them to come and live in New Zealand? And how do we potentially keep people who wouldn't be going off on their OI, but actually just feel like living overseas is a better option for them at the moment? It's a lot of give and take. It is a lot of give and take, but also I think people forget before the pandemic, we were looking at record immigration levels and everyone was saying we need to pull that back and close some of those visa categories down. Now we're in a situation we are wanting a lot of investment into different sectors, farming, agriculture, fruit picking. We've got all that stuff coming out. And construction, a labour for our construction industry. So it's a trade-off, isn't it? Absolutely. But keeps in your stories and we love hearing them. Breakfast at TVNZ.com.com. It's 10 minutes past date. And coming up, we are live in Singapore talking trade as the Prime Minister kicks off her first overseas trip since the start of that pandemic. We'll be live to Singapore after the break. Nine minutes. Nine minutes. Nine minutes. She turned and put it in. Oh, that's him, Mark. You want to be careful of that? The cops and guy chopped it up and put it in Patrick's scramble. She pulled the wall over his eyes. She doesn't seem like the murdering type. There's a type. Shorpeland Street. Tonight at 7 on 2.

Welcome back to breakfast. It is 15 minutes past eight. We're heading to Singapore now, where as you saw in the news, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardurn has landed, kicking off her first trade mission since 2020. Accompanying the Prime Minister on her week-long trip as Minister for Trade and Export Growth, Damien O'Connor, 13 of Aaldeo's business leaders and media as well. Our very own political editor, Jessica Much Mackay, is part of the media contingent and joins us now live. Morena, Jess, how are you going? Morena, Mattie, from a very tropical and warm Singapore first thing in the morning. I wish I could share some of this warmth and heat at 4 a very tropical and warm Singapore first thing in the morning. I wish I could share some of this warmth and heat at 4 a.m. from Singapore for you. It's a little muggy, let me tell you. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you. I'll feel the vibes anyway. Hey, this is a big deal, right, after a couple of years. What's the main purpose of the Prime Minister's visit? It's a big deal for a couple of reasons. First of all, it's the first time that she's broken Fortress, New Zealand, in two years. So the last time she went overseas was at the beginning of 2020 to Australia. We've faced several outbreaks since then, and trips to Australia and to Europe have been put on ice because of the outbreak. This is the first time she's put her feet on foreign soil. It's a couple of days in Singapore and then a couple of days in Japan and basically getting out to talk, trade, to try and boost our relationships and also send the message to the rest of the world. New Zealand's open for business, come and visit us for tourism soon. So there's a lot going on in this visit. But it isn't quite back to business as usual. We flew on the Defence Force plane to get here. There's several pre-departure tests we had to do in New Zealand and then several tests we're having to do. We did one last night as well. So it's not quite feeling like the normal time that you may travel overseas. We're lucky enough to do a bit of this in this job. But it's not, it doesn't feel quite back to normal yet. Yeah, but as you say, this is a big deal for the Prime Minister, and a big shift, I guess, as well, for the Prime Minister to push this New Zealand is open for business message that she's wanting to get across. Why Singapore and Japan? Why those two areas specifically? Well, we ask that question to officials and to the people who make those decisions. And there were a couple of reasons. First of all, Singapore and Japan are very important to us. There are our fourth and fifth largest trading partners. But it's also about schedules and timing. And you have to match all of those up as well. The Prime Minister wanted to be back in time for Anzac Day. It's a two-week recess at Parliament. So it is a bit of scheduling that goes on. And you can imagine with world leaders, they've got a bit going on. So that's why these two countries were chosen for this first trip. But in terms of opening up doors for the Prime Minister, she's got meeting with her counterpart here in Singapore. We're about to go off to a breakfast for the business delegates and then we go off to Astana, which is like the White House here in Singapore, we're about to go off to a breakfast for the business delegates, and then we go off to Astana, which is like the White House here in Singapore, we'll have an official state welcome. And in case you've forgotten what those leader-to-leader state welcomes look like, they're very grand and lavish. And you're looking forward to a pictorial treat when we get those pictures back to New Zealand later on this afternoon. I love it. This is a big deal, right? And there's a lot going on. So with the business delegates, who are we talking? And what will they be trying to push, Jess? These are some really big names in New Zealand. And basically, they're trying to talk trade. So at the moment, trade with Singapore last year, despite the pandemic, was $6 billion. It's big bucks for New Zealand, and that's just for Singapore alone. Zespri, Auckland Airport, Christchurch Airport. We've got some food specialists here. We've got people are experts in technology. So they're here. When you come on a diplomatic visit like this, the Prime Minister, her arrival, opens doors. So the business delegation are able to leverage that and get meetings and get face-to-face contact and try and boost some of that trade. Our relationship with Singapore has really gone up in the last few years. Our trade with them is really important. I didn't realize this and I've been to Singapore a few times and covered a few trade deals in Singapore, but we actually have more trade deals with Singapore than we do with any other country, which I didn't realize and thought was really interesting. So this is a big deal. This is us getting out and about and going back onto the world stage again. And after two years, it does feel slightly surreal. Yeah. You mentioned that. But what does have, because I guess you're travelling in quite close quarters. So what happens if, I guess you're all just trying to avoid COVID as much as possible, right? Because if someone gets it, that's a big hiccup in the plans. Yeah, so very nicely, we were told that, you know, we'll definitely look after you if you get COVID, but you will be left in Singapore and Japan if you test positive. So that's, you know, that's life. And if that happens, I'm sure you'll be thrilled to zoom from my isolation room in Singapore and Japan. But that is a risk with travelling here. I haven't had COVID yet. So that is a risk for most of the delegation traveling. They haven't. Some people have. And the risk for those as part of the contingent who have had COVID-19 is it can still show up in your test. So if that happens, they will not be able to travel forward even though we've got travel certificates saying that that's happened. So it's definitely a gamble. I mean, I don't think people would be too worried about a few media delegation or the business delegation getting stuck here. But if the Prime Minister did, that would obviously be a big deal. If we catch it here in Singapore, we'd have to isolate in a situation for a week. And if it was in Japan, we would have to isolate as well. So definitely a gamble. So just send me really good non-COVID vibes. Great. We're sending them all of, sending all those vibes your way, Jess. And like you say, this is a big deal, especially to be able to do this in person after such a long time. So we're looking forward to following you over the next week. That's Jessica Muchmukai, our excellent one-news political editor live for us in Singapore. Right, after the break, we are checking in with our Commonwealth athletes as they prepare for the games.

Morena, yeah, really good, because I haven't been doing anything, which is exactly how it should be this morning. I don't want to make a dick of myself, basically. But anyway, no ma'amay or no my hookie ma. Welcome back to the AUT Millennium, where we are celebrating 100 days until the opening ceremony of the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. And joining me this morning, very, very privileged to have Hayden Wild with us, our Olympic bronze medalist. Morina, how are you? Morina. No, I'm very good. How are you? Yeah, really good. Thank you so much for being with us this morning. Where's your medal? It's actually in the car at the moment, I think. Because I'm always in Fakitane or in Tauranga or I move around and I'm like, everyone's like, oh, I want to see the middle and it's like, well, I just keep my car just in case. So I don't forget it. So, you know, I like to keep people happy and show them the medal. And, you know, there's so many people in the background that helped out. So I'd like, you know, it's been, I've been in New Zealand everywhere to try and show everyone. That has been a part of the journey, so it's been crazy. So here's the interesting thing, because you and I were having a chat just before we came on air, about qualifying for the triathlon at the Commonwealth Games. I would have just thought, you know, bronze medalists at the Olympics, that you'd be automatically qualified, but you don't. It goes to a selection panel, but the other thing that you're trying to qualify for is the 5,000 meters. Talk to us about that. Yeah, so it's always been a goal of mine in Tokyo. I actually qualified in a way, I was top 40 in the world, which gave me a qualification spot to go towards the board. But unfortunately, didn't get the spot, as I didn't run the time, which is fair enough. But yeah, this time, Com Games, I'm giving it one more crack as well. For that, hopefully I can get an extension to go over to Europe and race in a few races over there and try and get that special time of around 1315. So it's quite exciting and, you know, no one's never done it before doing two different sports and one major games. So I'd love to be the first one to give it a crack and see how I can go. I guess what fascinates me about that is there are two completely different events, so to speak. So how do you train for that? Because you're talking about a triathlon, you know, where you're biking, running, swimming, and then all of a sudden 5,000 metres. So how do you get that right? Because it's only a couple of months. Yeah, it's really complicated in a way, but I've got to coach back in Toaanga that really looks over it. He's got massive experience. He also coaches Sam Tanna, who's our 1,500 metre, Tokyo lad. And, yeah, in a way it's complicated as you're running on a 400 metre track. That you're kind of running by splits per 400. We're on the road where you do a triathlon running normally, you know, you kind of go by pace. So it's so complicated things. One, you run consistently and try and, you know, break the pack up because you start with potentially, you know, you might be 10 seconds behind and trying to catch up in a triathlon. Where in the track, you obviously will start at once, and you're just gunning for the time, and hopefully you've got a kick at the end. So, yeah, it's two complicated things, and somehow I'm doing alright on the track, and I think it must be just from the massive engine that I get from when I swim and bike as well, and then, yeah, just a touch of speed, and yeah, it seems to come together. In terms of expectations, you go from a bronze at the Olympics heading to the Commonwealth Games how I imagine your expectations you know are higher than others but how do you manage that heading into a games yeah I guess it will this be uh potentially my first comm games to go to so I mean I guess I've never had kind of the pit on the back where everyone's chasing me. So I kind of really do enjoy pressure. It's where I kind of thrive, which is ideal. But yeah, it's really nice to kind of be in this position where people are looking at to try and beat you. I've never been in that position before. And I guess after Tokyo, going into a few races after that there was a bit of a slump which is fair enough, you know, you've been training for this for three, four years. But you know, I kind of finally got home, got to refresh see the family back home and yeah, I've just got this whole new motivation to kind of just kick on and just give it some. The guy they got second in the Olympics is from the UK, so I'm pretty sure there'll be a pretty awesome battle up front if we come off the run together. Love it. Hey, Hayden, thank you so much for joining us this morning, and all the very best for qualifying for both events. Thank you so much. No worries. Hayden Wilde joining us, our Tokyo Olympic bronze medalist. Stay with us. Coming up just before 9 o'clock, we're going to talk to our hammerthroar, and that is Julia Brackcliffe. She is the current Commonwealth Games champion. So we'll catch up with her just before 9 o'clock. Right now, though, it has gone 8.30. Here is in Dera with your news. Thanks, Jenny Mae. Magandang, Omaga. Russia has now launched its renewed attack on eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russian forces have stepped up their offences in several directions in the east, including trying to break through Ukrainian defences in the Luharsk and Kharkiv regions. Seven people have also been killed after Russian shelling hit Ukraine's east Donetsk region. And in the west of the country, Russian missiles have also killed seven people in Leviv. Until now, the city had largely escaped attacks. Civilians trapped in besieged areas of Ukraine won't be able to evacuate for two days with humanitarian corridors in the country shut. This morning, there was that message that you don't want to read if you or a civilian wanting to get out of several cities. And it was simply that there would be no evacuation routes opened up during the next 24 hours because there was simply too much Russian shelling to many Russian attacks on those corridors. Remember that these evacuation routes, they only work with local ceasefires, only if Russia and Ukraine agree that they're not going to attack each other, and that just hasn't happened. And Prime Minister, Dissinda Adirn, has kicked off her first overseas trade mission since the pandemic started over two years ago. One news political editor, Jessica Much Mackay is in Singapore and says it was important the Prime Minister left New Zealand for talks. This is the first time she's put her feet on foreign soil. It's a couple of days in Singapore and then a couple of days in Japan and basically getting out to talk, trade, to try and boost our relationships and also send the message to the rest of the world. New Zealand's open for business, come and visit us for tourism soon, so there's a lot going on in this visit. But in terms of opening up doors for the Prime Minister, she's got meeting with her counterpart here in Singapore. We're about to go off to a breakfast for the business delegates and then we go off to Astana, which is like the White House here in Singapore. Singapore and Japan are very important to us. There are fourth and fifth largest trading partners. But it's also about schedules and timing. And you have to match all of those up as well. The Prime Minister wanted to be back in time for Anzac Day. It's a two-week recess at Parliament. So it is a bit of scheduling that goes on. And you can imagine with world leaders, they've got a bit going on. And the search will resume today for a missing fisherman off the coast of eastern Bay of Plenty. The man, identified on social media as Jason Kauta, did not return from a fishing trip and was reported to police on Sunday afternoon. It's believed he had a white chili bin, red tote tank, wooden oars and a yellow life jacket on board his boat. Police are asking Bay of plenty of residents from Torre in the east to Makitu in the west to report any of these items if they water shore to the 10-5 number. And COVID-19 model is a warning against complacency, as predictions show the next wave could be here by spring. The current seven-day rolling average of new daily cases are sitting just below 8,000. Auckland University's Dr. Dionne O'Neill says the waning immunity of vaccines could lead to another wave of COVID. Late winter, early spring, you've got some of that waning protection there. Maybe that's combined with that seasonal effect of winter and maybe it's combined with people's behaviour and that relaxation, so that sends case numbers back up again. And in news, sports news, sorry, the central pulse have delivered the magic, a crashing, crushing defeat in Rotorua, both, I suppose, accurate shooting from Alia Dunn and Tiana Mituaro, helping the pulse to a 13-goal victory over the Waikato Bay of Plenty Side. At a 59-32 win sees the pulse to third on the table. I think for us, we were focusing on our critical moments this week and trying to be really specific in training and trying to get the most out of it. So I thought we did a really good job and I'm just proud of the girls just tonight's effort. And taking a look at your weather this morning it really does feel like autumn is rolling in slowly. Look there's heavy rain warning for Coromandel Peninsula this morning and that rain could also hit north of Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. If you can move further down south you are also in for heavy rain there. You can see that on the west coast side that heavy rain will be overnight and also tomorrow morning. And now to the north. Rain, rain, rain, pretty much everywhere, but it's still fairly humid. We're looking at about 90% humidity in this region, so you've seen possible heavy thunderstorms in Fittiyang at 21 degrees of your high but in Kaitai at 25 degrees is a high there so still fairly warm tents and further down it's looking similar through here you've got some cloud with occasional rainfall tauranga you're going to have heavy falls and possible thunderstorms throughout the day 21 degrees is your high 18 degrees it's a high in taupo and crossing to the East Coast. You've got cloud here for Danny Burke in Marston. Everybody else will get some drizzle this morning. 21 degrees is a high in Napier. Marston, you might get as low as 10 degrees today. And over to the west side. It's getting better here. It's a lovely morning in Palmerston North all the way down to the capital. Fonganua, you're going to have a great afternoon as well. 23 degrees is your high. And crossing the Cook Strait, it's pretty good here, I'd say. Blenham, you're looking at a high of 24 degrees, bit of a range. You'll go as low as 6 degrees. But from Blenheim all the way down to Hockey Teke, it is a lovely fine, gorgeous morning. 20 degrees is a high in Kaikoda. And further south, Canterbury, you would have seen some fog in the morning, but that is going to lift later on for a lovely fine day. 20 degrees is your high in Christchurch. And in the deep south, Queenstown will have a gorgeous day today and so will Dunedin. But cloudy with a few showers around Milford Sound and Invercargill, 20 degrees is a high for Gore. Nice, thanks, Endera. And thank you so much as well for all of your feedback on the brain drain. A lot of this, of course, is expected. People were always going to leave, especially after two years in lockdown. A lot of people love heading overseas on the OE. It's a natural course for a lot of New Zealanders, but for some people, it is purely because they feel like they can't get ahead in this country, Michelle. How are our kids expected to buy a house here at the moment? This is not the country for first-home buyers. It's ridiculous. So many of my young nursing and midwifery colleagues have gone to Australia for income and lifestyle. There will be more. Yeah. Marie, who moved back to New Zealand four years ago, spending 14 years in Ozzie, she says New Zealand isn years ago, spending 14 years in Aussie. She says New Zealand isn't what it used to be, and it was quite a shock coming back, seeing the cost of housing and food. That always plan to return home and buy some property here to retire, but the cost of housing is so high. I think if you've been away for 14 years, you definitely would have been shocked by the time you came back. Although you mentioned the balance, right? Deborah's saying that they moved back from Australia, her husband's earning almost double what he did in Australia, and of course people, you know, we are a fantastic country to live in for a reason because we've got beautiful scenery, very friendly people, and we've managed to say relatively safe through the pandemic. And people call New Zealand home and they want to return here. It's just about striking the balance, right? And making sure that when they do return here, they want to stay. And they feel like they can actually get ahead when they do come back here. And it's a long road ahead. And every country in the world, I'm sure, is facing these issues at the moment. Inflation is global right now. Look, up next year, we'll want to stick around for this. We are meeting the man. He is amazing, honestly. We are meeting the man behind these TikToks, paving the way for people living with Tourettes. We love him. Uncle Ticks up next. Even through your darkest nights, I'll be here for you.

A hundred days, Jamie. It's not far away. Yeah, not too far. No, not too far away at all with our athletes. A lot of them here haven't actually qualified for Birmingham as yet, but Julie Ratcliffe, who is with me now, has qualified for Birmingham. You are our defending champion, a Commonwealth Games champion, heading over to Birmingham. Anyway, how are you? Good morning. Good morning, Morena. I'm good, thank you. You are our defending champion, Commonwealth Games champion, heading over to Birmingham. Anyway, how are you? Good morning. Good morning, Morena. I'm good, thank you. How are you? Yeah, good. Hey, just, by the way, hammer throwing, amazing, but you were doing a little bit of the ribbon behind us in that interview with Hayden. Well, not bad, mate. Maybe that's your next thing. Anyway, going into the Commonwealth Games as the defending champion, I mean, do you feel a whole hepar pressure on you? Nah, not at this stage. I don't know, it was like, it's been four years. I'm a different athlete, I'm a different person. And the standard of the hammer throw has gone through the roof since then. There's a lot more depth. We could have three Kiwi girls over there. There's a couple of Canadians, a few British girls coming through. So I'm just looking forward to, like, fighting it out, you know. It'll be awesome to just have women's hammer throw front and center and just have a really deep competition. Actually, this is what we were talking about before we came on here. Like hammers throwing, how did that become your thing? And you were saying that actually there are more and more young kids coming through that want to do it. Yeah, definitely. So my dad got me into it and he's still my coach. But yeah, it was kind of, we tried all the different athletics events. I played quite a few sports as a kid. And, yeah, I was quite a powerful kid. So dad said, you know, maybe throwing. And I didn't have particularly long arms or I wasn't particularly tall. And he's like, maybe hammer throw. We didn't know anything about it. We kind of learned together. So, yeah, he's kind of got some Russian throwing books that have badly translated into English, got on YouTube, contacted some coaches around the world, and we've kind of, yeah, learnt together over the last 16 years or so. That's fascinating. So in terms of that relationship then with you and Ed, because you've kind of gone hand in hand on this journey together, has it been a coach athlete relationship, or how has that worked with you and Dad? I think it's definitely changed over time. Like, he's, I guess, first and foremost, my dad, which is awesome. Like, I know that as my coach, like, he's never going to let me down. He's always going to be there for me, which I know can be tricky as athletes and coaches move through their life. So I'm so grateful for that. But, yeah, it's, I think, especially as I've got older, like, definitely a lot of respect has grown between us. Like, I've understood, as I got out older how hard it is and how hard he works because I'm thinking, oh, you know, I'm the one doing all the training, but he works just as hard on the technical analysis, on doing the professional development to understand the technique. Yeah, and I think he kind of, I guess, as I've got older, I've had to take a bit more responsibility, moving around different cities and stuff like that and keeping the training going. So, yeah, it's been a cool relationship and I'm really grateful for it. In terms of heading over to Birmingham, have you got a plan in place yet where you get over there at the same time as the rest of the New Zealand team or will you go up a bit earlier or later? It's quite tricky, I guess, with COVID and trying to figure out where we can train. And I guess if we're changing countries a lot, like the COVID restrictions keep changing. So we actually have our world champs three weeks before in Eugene, Oregon, in the US. And so we... That'll be a good indicator, eh? Exactly. So me and dad will go over as three weeks before in Eugene, Oregon, in the US. And so we... That'll be a good indicator way. Yeah, exactly. So me and Dad will go over a couple of weeks before that to the US to do a bit of a training camp. And then straight after that, mid-July, we'll head over to somewhere in Europe. We're not sure yet. Maybe the UK, maybe Europe, to get onto the time zone, get to the good weather or the bad weather. If it's, you know, the UK. And, yeah, do a bit of training for the Commonwealth Games. So, yeah, looking forward to it. I haven't been over for a big training camp in a long time, so it'll the UK. Yeah. And yeah, you should do a bit of training for the Commonwealth Games. So, yeah, looking forward to it. I haven't been over for a big training camp in a long time, so it'll be good. Yeah. I know you've spent most of your life in Waikato, all right? And you were down in Wellington for a little bit, but you just moved here to Auckland the big smoke. How are you going? That's good. I'm actually on, I'm just five minutes down the road from the track from Millennium, so I haven't managed to get lost on the way to training yet, which is good. I'm notoriously bad at directions. so my partner is sitting at home going, she comes home tonight. But, you know, it's cool. Everyone's been super welcoming here, and yeah, so I'm looking forward to kind of settling in a bit more and finding my feet. Well, welcome to Auckland. It is lovely to have you here, and all the very best is you build up towards the Commonwealth Games and look to defend your title Julia Ratcliffe. Thanks so much for your time. Cheers, thank you.

I let you watch me pay. Over the past couple of weeks, we've been discussing particularly within the media. We spoke with Uncle Ticks, particularly within the media. We spoke with Uncle Ticks, and if you don't know who he is, you should. Or your kids will certainly know who he is. He has almost as many TikTok followers as there are people in this country. It was fascinating. Take a look. Giora. Hello, my name is Uncle Tix. This is Big Barba Lige. Today, we're doing a haircard with Tourette's. I'm going flying on an airplane. I'm a little bit nervous. I have Tourette's and today we are making cupcakes. Hey! Surely. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Okay, this is gonna be a nice smooth landing. Cloudy with a chance of mebles. Crack it in the bowl. Yep. That's not the bowl. Oh my goodness. Tics has Tourette's and creates TikTok videos about his daily life living with a disability. So I sat down with him to have a chat about why his videos are so important. So I was diagnosed, AMR! The ages... Six? I was up there, I think it was the age of six. You have to look at my misses there. My mum and Nana were watching me. I was trying to play the Nintendo. Sorry, Maddie, I love you. I was trying to play Nintendo, trying to play NBA game. And I couldn't get in the hoop because I get like this. Every time we go to shoot the ball. And my mum's like, Ah! Bev, we've got to do something about this boy. He's a little bit different, a little bit weird, you know? And my nana always called me a weird one, which I was growing up. That's okay. So growing up, you know, went to school. I got suspended from school, actually. It was horrible because of my tics. I once kicked a girl. I ticked. She was actually bullying me, and I told her to get away from me because I was going to tick. And I kicked her, and then I got suspended. So back in the 90s, bro, there weren't much, we'll just say I was oppressed. I was held back quite a bit until I really came out of my shell in high school. Still was getting bullied. And then after schools, after all my schooling, I just thought, I just really don't give any more. You know, I'll just own it, and it's kind of my life story. For those who don't know what Tourette's is, how do you explain it to people? It's a neurological dysfunction in your brain. So there's just one part in the very middle of my brain that doesn't work properly and it sends off the signals around my body to do things that are a little bit different to other people. Pretty much the best way to put it here. It's different for everyone though, right? So I've got coprolalia, which is a swearing tick. I also have a mimicking turret. So if you were to say something, if you were to say something to me, I would probably mimic it. So sometimes it comes out verbally, sometimes it comes out physically as well. Yeah, yeah. So when I got here, I go at this, that's my tick. I'll smack you on the face. Anyone that I've bloody met always gets a little love tap from me. She even got one on the way up here, your producer, so it's quite hard case really. Obviously, you can understand then why it would be hard for someone like you to go to school. Good question. But back in the day, my Tourettes were quite mellow, so I wasn't quite out the gate. I was drugged up, bro, on Rital and other horrible substances. So at what point did you think I'm going to own this? Because it must have been for a long time something you wanted to suppress and you wanted to hide about yourself. I was 24 bro, you know, 28 now, so it was only four years ago. It was thanks to my partner and my friends that I live with now and some friends back home from my local club. I'm really close with a lot of them from the back bar. And they just told me to stop caring about stuff. Stop caring about things and start owning it. And then I did. It became such a happy person after that and yeah, nothing really gets me down now. Do you feel embarrassed sometimes still? Do I feel embarrassed still? That's a good question. I guess it depends. Oh, that's... still? That's a good question. I guess it depends. Oh, that's... See, that's a bad one. I guess it depends where I am and who I'm with. See, if I'm around new people, I get really embarrassed. If I'm around people that I already know, I don't. But if we're in a situation, say there are some Brown brothers and sisters that walk into a room, I'm going to rip them off and I feel really bad about it, but if I feel to the point where they're getting really embarrassed and upset about that, I'll go and explain to them, look, I've got Tourette's, my cousin's so sorry. If they get offended, it's kind of on you because I've explained what it is, but if you don't and you accept it, that's a good, that's a win for me. Do you find people becoming more accepting? Yep, sometimes. Everyone recognizes me on the street now from TikTok and everything else. So, um, and I guess people are a lot more accepting, but you get the old Kuya, um, and in, and Kaumato, I feel it's worse for, for the elder generation. Can you control it at all? No, no. So I bought my tongue if I'm in a real nervous, so I bought my tongue if I'm in a real nervous situation. I'll make it bleed to the point so I don't tick. Yeah, bro. Yep. A lot of people also ask, because I got my whole arm done, my mokul, right? So I got all my arm done right up to here and people are like to you, how did you get there done if you're jumping around and you're flicking yourself around? I'm like, bro, when you've been sitting on a table for 12 hours, getting your mokko done, I think pain overrides a lot, so pain comes out of nowhere, Maddie, and it's just like, no tics today, brother. So, yeah, pain brings it down. Tell me about the TikTok and the social media, and what influence that's had in changing your life? Well, it's my full-time job now, Maddie. I stream on Twitch. I talk to people on Instagram every day. I've got a really cool management team. It's just taking my life over. I don't have enough hours in the day to post or do anything. Because how many followers do you have on TikTok? Almost as much as this country. Seriously? Yeah. 4.1 million followers on TikTok. And it's you basically just documenting your life with Tou. Seriously? Yeah. 4.1 million of Ozontics. And it's you basically just documenting your life with Tourette. Yeah, pretty much. Just everything I'm doing and enjoying my life and owning who I am because there's no point sitting under this bloody rock anymore. It's hard to understand how it comes out and how it gets processed in your brain. But I guess that's the point. It doesn't get processed in your process. It's exactly right. It just comes out. Yeah. it gets processed in your brain. But I guess that's the point. It doesn't get processed in your brain. It's exactly right. It just comes out. Nothing gets processed. Growing up, bro, there was really no support, bro. I got no support from any Tourette's association. My mum had no support. They never ever supported us. It's no shade either. There was nothing out there. And there still really isn't to this day. So the reason I did this, Maddie, was to say, if you're different in any way, it's okay to be different. How do you feel now? Are you happy? Oh, mate, I do this shit every week. I'm bloody, I'm bloody marvellous. I've got cool friends, good missus, and, you know, I'm stuck days with my life, mate. A good missus. A good missus. Can I just give a shout out to his partner, Olivia Campbell, who I also think is amazing. She's incredible. She's a very talented nurse. Yes. Yeah. And he mentioned it in the piece there. Her support has really given him the confidence and kind of share his life online. Because it's a tough thing to share your life online, especially when you're living with something like Tourette's. And he's done it so bravely but also so honourably and in a way that he can educate us all and normalise you know he's not it's not a unique situation we're all learning and it makes anyone that feels a little bit different feel not so isolated so it's a beautiful thing so thank you to Uncle Tex and thank you to you for watching this morning as well so safe kepa torah at Uncle Tix and thank you to you for watching this morning as well.
