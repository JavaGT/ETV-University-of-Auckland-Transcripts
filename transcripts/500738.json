And thanks to our partner's chorus. I had to be careful there not to say Monday. Because it does feel like Monday, but it's Tuesday. Yes. And remember on Thursday, I said happy Friday, everybody. So we'd look completely stupid. Still getting dressed as it happens. Yeah, now that I've just seen myself. It's been a long weekend. How are you going? It's still on a long weekend, obviously. I am. How you doing? I'm great. Good weekend. Fantastic weekend. Enjoyed your weekend. Yes. Tell you what I did a lot of around the weekend, and that I am. How you doing? I'm great. Good weekend. Fantastic weekend. Enjoyed your weekend. Yes. Tell you what I did a lot of around the weekend and that was going to cafes because I thought, right, these guys need. And incidentally, I was on an island, an undisclosed island in New Zealand. Well, the reason I won't save the name is because I don't want to dobb them in, but everything was open all weekend. But is that not under a tourist rule where you can trade because you're in a tourist area? Oh, really? Yes. The whole weekend we were thinking, you know, naughty. Yeah, we were. Good on them, you know, get in there. Your tourist town. So you've got your Queensland. They've got an exemption that they can. Okay, well, it was Waikki Island. There we go. Great place to go. But one thing, and the taxi driver, as soon as we arrived, he said, well, you'll be waiting in a few lines around here. And I said, why? And he said, well, because there aren't that many staff on the island, because we've had the borders closed, rammed shut. And I just saw this morning, our Prime Minister is selling us to the world in Singapore and in Japan. Tourism, right? Are we actually ready? This is the point I think I made last week. It's all very well saying, come on over Aussies and the rest of the world. But we're still suffering the effects of COVID. Do we have enough staff in the shops? If people want to come for a meal, are they waiting for now because they're under so much pressure? You don't want to send the wrong message, do you, that we actually can't cope. It's chicken all the egg, though, isn't it? Because until we open our borders and get people over, we're not going to, you know, if we don't do that, we're not going to get the stuff. True. And we're always going to have these delays, aren't we? The other thing I saw on the news last night, News Hub Live at 6, good show. The car rental companies. So these poor guys had to sell all their fleet when the pandemic hit. And now they're short, there was one company, I think think 30,000 cars short for the busy period. And they're going to have to wait up to a year to get new cars in. I hope they haven't sold planes. No, they want to get on a few of those. No, they park those all on the desert. Yes, they do. You see. So they keep those going. Speaking of shortages, we were accused of stealing the sharp knives from the motel that we stayed at. Because... Only the serrated ones, not the non-serrated. The pealers and all the sharp ones. Yes, me. Because we've got a good explanation. We have a toddler, obviously, and as soon as we got in there... Well, yeah, so nothing is childproofed, you know, as it shouldn't be in a motel, but we got in and the first thing we did was move all of the sharp things up to the top shelf in the bedroom, in the wardrobe, but we forgot to tell them so it wasn't until a couple days later we rang up and said, oh, by the way, if you need your knives, they're in the top shelf of the bedroom, they're in the top shelf of the bedroom. They're like, what? So, yeah, they thought it was quite funny. I've heard of some pinky stuff, but that's next level. All right, we've better get into the show. That's funny. A life of a parent. It is coming up to 6 o'clock. This is AM. On our show this morning, our cruise ship industry remains at a standstill with still no clear guidance on when maritime borders will open. The New Zealand Cruise Ship Association. Yes, it's real, but with us at 10 past 7. First it was petrol prices, then food, now mortgage rates are on the rise, and inflation is set to hit record levels. We put the cost of living crisis to Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson at 740. Russia has intensified its assault on Ukraine with Maria Pohl on the brink of collapse and missiles striking the western city of LeViv. Europe correspondent. Lesette Raymer has all the details at 20 past 7. And it's 100 days out from the Commonwealth Games. So we're off to an athlete warm up and chat with triathlete Hayden Welk. That's just 4-8. It's time for the news. Atomare, it's 6 o'clock. Prime Minister Jacinda Adirn has arrived in Singapore, touching down on her first overseas trip since the COVID pandemic began. News Hub, political reporter Amelia Wade, is travelling with the PM and sent this report. After touching down here in Singapore, the Prime Minister is set to have her first overseas grip and grin since the start of the COVID pandemic more than two years ago. She's off to the Astana to meet with the President and the Prime Minister. They were talking about China, Ukraine and the trade partnership that we are both in, the CPTPP, and how to entice the United States to it. The schedule here is absolutely jam-packed in showing off New Zealand's finest to make sure the Prime Minister keeps her promise to give New Zealand good bang for its buck with this trip. State Highway 3 near New Plymouth has reopened after police fatally shot a man on Saturday night. A scene examination has been completed after 22-year-old Chaos Price was shot and killed by police three days ago. A few details have been revealed about what happened. Police say they pulled over an associate of Price before Price himself rammed a patrol car. What happened after is unclear. A number of investigations are ongoing. Winter is looming and so too is a second wave of COVID-19. Although modellers say it's unclear just how bad a second round of the virus would be as it's not known just how many people were infected during this year's first wave. But there is one group that Professor Michael Baker remains most concerned about. Only 20% of a bit over 20% of children, fully vaccinated school-aged children, and a third of adults who are eligible for boosters haven't received them yet. There were just over 6,000 cases on Monday with a further 11 deaths. Russia's assault on Ukraine has spread to its western border as missiles had the previously untouched city of Elvue. At least seven people have been killed in a series of Russian missile strikes the first civilian victims in the western city. It comes as Ukrainian officials warn that threats of an attack on the country's east are now becoming a reality, with more missile strikes reported in Kharkiv. United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths says despite ongoing efforts to stop the violence, he isn't optimistic. Obviously, we have not yet got humanitarian ceasefires in place on the Russian side. I went into a lot of detail on this, and they continue to promise to get back to me on the details of those proposals. Meanwhile, Russian efforts to take the port city of Mariupol are ramping up, trapping nearly 100,000 civilians in the city. Two teenagers are dead after a shooter opened fire on a party in Pittsburgh. 200 party goers were crammed into an Airbnb rave when the incident took place. In total, 10 shots were fired, leaving eight others with moderate injuries. 200 party goers were crammed into an Airbnb rave when the incident took place. In total, 10 shots were fired, leaving eight others with moderate injuries. In sport, New Zealand squash star Joelle King has ended her title drought by winning the Manchester Open. King powered her way past top seed Sarah Jane Perry in straight games to win her first title since 2019. It was an emotional victory for the 33-year-old who's faced plenty of challenges to get to this point. I've been through a lot of downs, so to be at this point winning a tournament against the calibre of players that we have on tour, I mean so much. The West's Tigers have finally recorded their first win of the NRL season with an epic 21 to 20 upset victory over the Parramatta Eels. Well, the scores locked at 20 all in time on the clock. Playmaker Jackson Hastings launched a 38 metre field gold. Gold to clinch at one point victory was amazing. Hastings' efforts stunned the crowd and helped lift the tigers off the bottom of the ladder. Pressure off Madge Maguire too. That's the very latest from NewsHub. It is four minutes past six. Thanks very much, Bernardine. And of course it is still Easter holidays, a school holidays for many people. So many of you may be off around the country still at the moment. We did a bit of a road trip at the weekend. Love a good Kiwi road trip. Head north. We did head north. We did head north. And it got me thinking we didn't go to my very favourite stretch of road, but my favourite road trip stretch in New Zealand is Northland when you're coming out of Waipoa Forest and you're going up over the hill and you see the sand dunes of Opunoni. Yes. Beautiful. Best. Any stretchers... Well, I would actually say the same. Right. I think you might have taken that from me. Because I would say exactly the same thing. It's because you've got this cavern over your head with the trees, don't you? And then you come out and it's just yeah, it's beautiful. The other one is, which you won't see now, probably because of transmission gully, but is coming over the Pai Kakariki Hill looking at the Kapri Coast when you're going north from Wellington? Beautiful. But most people will miss that now because they'll be in some gully. Karangahaki Gorge, too. Yes, that's my favourite. Is it? I think if I had to bring a tourist over and show them a beautiful part of New Zealand, a gorgeous day through the Karangahaki Gorge, which is Auckland to Tauronga. You go through that way. Also, Linda's Pass, pass, you know, down South Island, beautiful. So we're so lucky. Karagaki Gorge. I've always thought there was sort of, sort of pit stop murder vibes. Well, that's why it's cool. Because it's so, it's dramatic on either side, isn't it? Yeah, but you always feel like someone's going to jump out and... Do you? Yeah, I've never felt comfortable in the Karangahaki gorg. Oh, they've got gorgeous bike trails. No, actually, I've always thought, if I have to go to Tauranga, I'll fly. I don't want to get murdered. I don't want to be stabbed in that gorge. Oh, God. Seriously. It's not stopped for me. Driving's dangerous enough. William probably has seen a few good sights. You're off around the country quite a lot. William, any particular stretches of road that you quite fancy? Yeah, Morena team. Oh, that's a good question. Mao Tore Bay up north is always good. And come in, I like Opochiki. Quite like that little stretch there. It's quite beautiful as well. It really gets me in that mood. That morale. When you're in the car, eating the ice cream, the chips. It really gets me in that mood. That morale, when you're in the car, eating the ice cream, the chips, really gets me fired up that. Well, guys, hey, let's head to the weather, eh, around the Motu. Tomorrow's weather, brought to you by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. An orange heavy rain morning is in place for the Carole Mandel Peninsula. Expect up to 120 millimetres of rain in areas with large amounts of surface water and thunderstorms. There are also heavy rain watches in eastern parts of Auckland, the Bay of Plenty and parts of Fiordland this morning. Now to the rest of your weather. A fine day in the lower south with cloudy periods and light winds throughout. Ote Poti Danirin on 20 degrees and Tahuasana, Queensland, you're on 17. To the west close, a cloudy start for you, sprinkled with a few showers and light winds. Peelpeel Tahi, Milford Sound, 17 degrees, and Kawatiri, Westport, a high of 21. In Canabria, a fine day were some evening cloud and possible showers, or Tautahi Christchurch on 20 degrees, and Hakater, Ashburden, 19. A mostly fine day in the lower north, with morning cloud cover increasing throughout the day, to Fonganui atara Wellington with the high of 20 degrees, and Faka Oriori, Marsden, 23. Now to the central plateau, you can expect cloudy periods and showers scattered throughout the day. Taupo on 18 degrees and Fanganui winning on 23. To the east coast you have cloud coverage with rainfall expected to clear in the afternoon, Tauranga and Ahrueri Naipia both on 21 degrees. And to the top of our country, Altearoa, a wet day with showers, possible thunderstorms coupled with some nor easterly winds, Damke, Macauroa, Auckland, 24 degrees and Keri-Roa, Hamilton, 21. How many est eggs did we all eat, guys? I'm telling you right now, I probably put on about 5Ks over the four days, eating east eggs, hot cross buns. And today it starts my diet now. Tuesday, it's on. Yeah, right. Whatever. We've all got leftovers, William. You will too. That's why I'm wearing a big jacket to cover what's happened over the last few days, so I'll keep that on all day, I think. Well, I feel for you being with the Com Games athletes for today, 100 days out for Com Games, you're going to be feeling a little bit inadequate next to them after your rest of them. Yeah, I know. Well, they'll help me run it off. They'll help me run it off. William, thanks very much. We're talking to road trips this morning and lovely parts of the country to drive. Let us know yours. Feedback at amshow.com. Maybe you've got any pictures as well of some of those beautiful sites along our roads. Please do. And I mean, I did eat too much at the weekend. I'm happy to admit that. I actually bumped into, you know, Samantha Hayes, who reads the News Hub live, six months into her. And she was telling me about dream feeding. So you guys know about this, both being mothers. Yeah. I'm not sure I'm liking where you're going to go with it, right? I wasn't expecting that from Easter eggs to dream feeding. Well, because I did a bit of dream feeding on the weekend as well. I had some chocolate next to the bed, right? And when I went to bed at night, it was there, and when I woke up in the morning it was gone, and I don't remember waking up during the night. Did you take the dog on holiday? No, there was no dog. There was no one else to be spoken of. I think I was dream feeding myself during sleep. Oral the story, don't leave your chocky by the bedroom. Did you do an Easter bunny hunt for your little boy? No, we're Grinchers. He's too little to really understand. So we figure we're going to try and cut the chocolate for as long as possible. Oh, that sounds a bit cruel. I know, I am a bit of a lot. Most parents do the Easter bunny hunt for the parents, just FYI. Did you do one, Bernie? But Easter bunny was a day late to our house because I was working, but we did it yesterday, and I coped right until the last minute, and then the ears off my Easter bunny went last night with a hot tea. At least you were awake when it happened. It's so true, no dream feed there. 11 minutes after 6 now. Fewer people died on the roads this Easter, which is great news. The road toll for the holiday period this year finished at 4, significantly down on last year. So are we driving more safely or is just a case of luck? Let's find out. Inspector Peter McKinney is with us, co-director of road safety partnerships. Welcome to the program. Orna. So have you got an update for us? Because it ends actually officially 11 minutes ago, doesn't it? The period of Easter period. Yeah, it does. And tragically, we've had four people killed on the roads over the Easter period. Hey, look, it's certainly a major improvement on last year, but that's still four families who are grieving the loss of loved ones and circumstances where maybe those deaths could have been avoided. If we had had better roads, would they have been avoided? It's not so much the nature of the roads. It's how fast and our manner of driving on the roads. So we need to adjust to the conditions. And just remember to Easter, the fact that Easter's finished isn't an opportunity to relax on the roads. Every day on the roads has risks around it and we've still got Anzat weekend coming up and we're in the middle of school holidays. Totally. But if we had better roads then the speed and the other things you mentioned wouldn't be as important. Well it's not a matter. It's more a matter of driving to the roads as they are. You can't expect the roads to change overnight, but we can change our manner of driving overnight. We can change how fast we're driving on the roads overnight. And certainly we can make sure everyone's got their seatbelts on, that we're not driving impaired, and that we're not distracted by cell phones and so forth. Do you know how much of our roading network, according from a police perspective, you would consider to be unsafe for us to drive on at 100Ks? That's probably more a matter for Waka Katahi, New Zealand Transport Agency, to answer. Police's role is just to try and influence people to drive at safe speeds. It's up to Waka Katahi and other road controlling authorities, councils and as such to set speed limits. Would you like to see as a police officer, and remember it's the police Waka Katahi and other road controlling authorities, councils and as such to set speed limits. Would you like to see as a police officer, and remember it's the police officers, of course, who are often there first on the scene and looking at horrific things on our roads? Would you like to see safety improvements to the roads? The reason I ask you is that last Easter, this very conversation was being had, of course, about the Easter road toll, and it was the AA that came out and said there was underfunding of road maintenance in New Zealand to the tune of about a billion dollars. And they said then a year ago that it was so critical that parts of our road network would start failing and causing accidents. So, you know, as a police service, how worried about the roads are you? And do you actually advocate for change with government? Yeah, the roads themselves don't cause accidents. It's how people drive on the roads that contribute to crashes occurring. And even if money was available, it would still take time to implement. And very in mind, we've got about 19,000 kilometres of network. You can't expect all that to be done. So the important thing is for people to drive safely and appropriately for the roads as they are and and that's what will help people keep people safe in other words don't blame the roads what about what about the speeds then because last year there were about 130 crashes involving speed what is speed Is that speed that's over the legal limit? Or is it speed that's too quick for the environment? It's just speed that contributes to every crash. I mean, it's no matter the other contributing factors to a crash, speed is also always contributes to the outcome. Your bodies are only able to survive certain speed impacts, and most modern vehicles, even your five-star vehicles, are designed to protect you in a frontal impact crash. It speeds up to 70 kilometres an hour. So that's where it's really important to be aware and alert all the time all you're driving, looking out for hazards. Things happen unexpectedly. People make mistakes. That's human nature. We can't avoid that. We just need everyone to be alert on the roads and be aware of hazards and be in a position to drive in a manner that enables you to slow down and avoid a crash when the unexpected occurs in front of you. I have one very quick question before we go. Is there somewhere in the car you should sit? Because I know it's long weekends, the things where parents are sending their kids off with friends and they're going on road trips. Is there a seat in the car you should sit, a passenger seat, that is more safe than the others? Rare seats are potentially a little bit safer than front seats, but then often rear seats don't have airbags and that sort of thing with the front seats do. So the main thing is to everyone must wear a seatbelt and be properly restrained. And, you know, no one's sitting on knees and that sort of carry on. And if you're young kids and that are going away on a holiday with their friends, try and let them use the family car, which may have high safety rating than the car they own themselves, and that's going to hold them a good stead, should they be unfortunate enough to be involved in a crash? Yeah, good advice. Hey, thank you very much for your time this morning. Really appreciate it. Co-director of Road Safety Partnerships. Inspector Peter McKinney this morning is 16 after 6. For children, of course, the backseat, when they're really young, is always the safest. It must be so frustrating for police, though, when they are turning up to crashes at the same points on the same roads constantly. And it often is the case. But it's just surprising to hear the police officers there say, no, it's not the roads and we don't advocate for better roads. Is that the right attitude to be taking? I think there's an element of that, but I'll tell you what, the biggest deterrent you'll ever have on the road is having the visual presence of a police officer. You'd never see more brake lights go on is when you see a cop car go past. Everyone slows down. Maybe if there's a bigger police presence, would be a little more mindful, a little more worried about watching that speed. I know I am when I see it, oh, it's a reminder for a speed check. Yeah, and patience. Patience is the big one, isn't it? Yeah, a big contributor to crashes.

Great to have you watching this morning. Yes, 21 after 6. That's all I had to say. The latest consumer price index figures will be released this Thursday, and it's thought it'll confirm that inflation's hit its worst rate since the late 80s. Thanks to our partners at Milford Asset Management, Independent economist Cameron Bagger joins us for more on that now. Well, I don't know about worst rate, but it's certainly going to be particularly high, isn't it? What is the significance of it potentially moving over 7%? Well, it doesn't matter whether it's 6, 7 or 8. It's either way you're slice and dice it, it's a hellish of a high number. And I guess if you look at your benchmark it compared to where wages are moving, so if we look at the Labor Cost Index, we're going to get some figures on that in a couple of weeks. The Labor Cost Index is going to be around 3%. So 3% take away 7, your cost of living is minus 4. If you look at the typical household or wage earner out there at the moment, you're going backwards to the churn of about 4%, which is a pretty big hit to take over 12 months. Because that's the key, isn't it, the comparison to wages, because if wages are keeping pace, then I guess it doesn't matter as much, but because they're not, that's why it's hurting Kiwi so much? Yeah, well, inflation is a thief that literally siphons money out of your pocket as well as out of your car in the form of petrol. So the danger at the moment is that we get into a bit of a rat race or a bit of the old mouse on the exercise wheel. When inflation goes up, and because inflation goes up, we force up wages to compensate on the other side. That adds their costs. Costs go up. Of course, firms want to recruit those costs. And then we start seeing price inflation go up on the other side, and then, lo and behold, the spiral is in motion or the mouse is going round and around and around in the excise size wheel. And we're starting to see a fair bit of risk on that front at the moment when we start seeing inflation move up, you know, 5.9% at the moment, moving towards 7, and of course the minimum wage moved up by 6%. So there is an awful lot of pressure on out there at the moment to keep wages moving up with inflation. We've got to get really careful that we don't get on that treadmill. Is the only way to stop this to curb spending both on an individual level and at a government level? Well, if you look at a lot of the inflation we're seeing at the moment, about 50% of it is offshore. It's beyond our control. It's what's called tradable inflation, and we're seeing a lot of it, and we're just going to have to be patient in regard to reconnecting global logistics, COVID going away, etc, etc, etc. The remaining 50% is just a basic mismatch between demand versus supply. We've literally got an economy at the moment that is too hot to drop. There's too much demand relative to our ability to meet that demand. So there's two potential solutions. One, we raise the economy's ability to meet demand and that literally means you're more workers opening the board is up, a more dynamic, productive economy to lift the supply side capacity. If we can't do that, then the other side is to curb demand. And that's what the Reserve Bank is out there waving that interest rate stick, and the form of trying to slow the likes of the property market, slowing durable spending. And, of course, the other thing that would help, particularly in the 2022 budget, if the government eased up on the amount of spending that they're pouring on the economy, when you've already got an economy that's too hot to trot. The government has said that a lot of this is imported. You say around 50%. How do we compare internationally? Well, against some countries such as Australia, we're worse. Against some countries such as the United States are actually on the good side of the leisure. So the United States is up around eight and a half. And if you look at Australia at the moment, Australia's around three and a half, but they're on track to head towards sort of five. So whichever way you slice and dice, most countries around the globe are up on that five to nine percent sort of basket. So we're all seeing across the board pretty similar pressures in regard to what's happening in global logistics, supply change, commodity prices, petrol, oil, etc, etc., etc., but big differentiating factor out there at the moment in regard to the degree or magnitude of inflation is how hot your economy is. And some economies are a little bit hotter than others, and I guess New Zealand's at that hot end of the spectrum relative to a lot of other countries. So, lo and behold, we've got a fair bit of what's called non-tradable inflation. Non-tradable inflation looks like it's going to be around 6.5%. Normally it runs around 3%. Right, so that might explain that disparity between us and Australia. Independent economist Cameron Baggery, thanks very much. And of course, we're talking business every Tuesday and Thursday, thanks to our friends at Milford. Yeah, it's interesting listening to that, isn't it? I mean, Cameron always is. But the other thing about things are going too hot and us not being able to keep friends at Milford. Yeah, it's interesting listening to that, isn't it? I mean, Cameron always is. But the other thing about, you know, things are going too hot and us not being able to keep up. At the weekend, we've all been talking about experiences we've had at cafes, tourism operators.

We'll get to that soon. It's time now for the news. Atmarie, it's 6.30. The Easter Road toll has officially closed to ending with four deaths. The fourth death is believed to have occurred in a crash near Dunedin overnight. State Highway 1 near Colton Hill remains closed after a crash at around 930 last night. Last year's Easter road toll ended with nine fatalities. Meanwhile, Inspector Peter McKinney told A.N. Despite the Easter road toll nearly halving this year, drivers shouldn't be complacent. Just remember to Easter, the fact that Easter's finished isn't an opportunity to relax on the roads. Every day on the roads has risks around it and we're still got Anzac weekend coming up and we're in the middle of school holidays. The Prime Minister has arrived in Singapore, touching down on her first overseas trip since the COVID pandemic began. Jacinda Dern flew via Australia on an Air Force Boeing 757 and was greeted by Singapore Prime Minister, Andrani Raja. In the coming day, Sardun will spend time with Singaporean and Japanese prime ministers discussing security, particularly concerns over China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. There are also light-hearted activities planned including pavlover cutting, rugby promotions and even a visit to the Japanese cookie time factory. The search from a fisherman missing off the east coast near a port-a-key will resume this morning. The man was reported missing after failing to return home on Sunday afternoon from a fishing trip at Toreri in the Bay of Plenty. The search area stretches from Toreri north to Makatu. Police are asking people to keep an eye out for items such as a 100-liter chili bin, wooden ores and a yellow life jacket. Coast Guard, surf, lifesaving and rescue helicopters are expected to join the search today. The Pope has been told by Ukrainian Marines that Maripal is what hell on earth looks like. Russian reinforcements have joined the battle for the Port City trapping 100,000 civilians in the line of fire. Despite the bombardment, Ukrainian troops are holding on, with officials warning if they fail, few troops will make it out alive. Ukrainian defence, a minister-minister, ministry spokesman, Alexander Mahutsjunk, says, while it's tough, it's keeping Russian forces occupied. Maripol has attracted a very large enemy force, and in fact the way the defenders of this city are holding on, it prevents Russia from relocating these units to other directions, but it comes at a cost. Thousands are dead. Meanwhile, Russian missiles have killed civilians in both the western city of Lavu and the eastern city of Harkiv and Act officials are calling barbaric. 10,000 troops have been deployed to flood-affected areas in South Africa as the desperate hunt for survivors enters its second week. Historic rainfall carved through villages and cliffsides near Durban early last week, washing out roads, homes and entire city blocks.

Brilliant. Thank you very much, Bernardine. Lots of feedback coming in about our roads and the poor state of much of our road network this morning. This after, everyone's been out in their cars tutuing around, but a Sunday driving there was at the weekend. Kevin says, listening to the police officer we had on earlier this morning, yes, speed kills, but they've reduced speeds all over Auckland and are making a lot of money from speeding cameras in these places. I don't believe it works. Yeah, the inspector is saying that actually it's not the state of the roads that cause accidents. It's the way we drive on them. Luigi says I've driven close to a million kilometres on New Zealand roads. Many roads have sections that do cause accidents. Long stretches of tar melt, known as summer ice. Our roads are worse than some third world countries, and all NZTA do as lower speed limits. Yeah, the thing is, we're both right, aren't we? I mean, if the roads were better, then, of course, you could go faster and you wouldn't need, you know, you'd have fewer accidents. If the roads were better and there weren't so many tight bends and things in the roads, then they would be safer, wouldn't they? But at the same time, until we get those roads, which Lord only knows if that'll happen when we're all being told to get public transport, then we have to drive to the conditions of the current roads, don't we? Which means slowing the hell down, I suppose. If you've ever driven the Waikato Expressway, it's two lanes, it's 110Ks. All the traffic seems to flow pretty well, because you've got areas to pass, and it's a new safe road. I guess with these bad stretches where accidents happen quite often, you could say, well, that's a bad stretch of road, and clearly the road is contributing to the accident. But then also, I guess the argument is millions of people drive that stretch of road and don't have an accident. So if you're driving carefully, you should be fine. You just said early impatience. People just get so impatient and they want to put the foot down, don't they? Yeah. 23 minutes away from 7. We love your feedback. So please send us your emails this morning.

Coming at you from Mairangi Bay, yeah, it's so windy. Check it out. It's all go. I've got to hold on to my hat, hold on to try and keep a low, low base just to stay put. There's foam coming straight off the surf as well. It's so windy. But hey, let's check out the weather around the Motu. Tomorrow's weather brought to by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. An orange heavy rain warning is in place for Coramandel Peninsula. Expect up to 120 millimeters of rain in areas with large amounts of surface water and thunderstorms. There are also heavy rain watches in eastern parts of Auckland, the Bay of Plenty and parts of Fiordland this morning. Now to the rest of your weather. A fine day in the lower south with cloudy periods and light winds throughout, Otepoetan Deneer on 20 degrees and Tahuna, Queenstown on 17. To the west coast, a cloudy day for you, sprinkled with a few showers and light winds, peopo tally, milford sound, 17 degrees, and Kawateri Westport, a high of 21. In Canabria, Moulbara, a fine day with some evening cloud and possible showers. It will Tautahue Christchurch on 20 degrees in Hakatere Asperd in 19. A mostly fine day in the lower north of morning cloud cover increasing throughout the day to Fanganui atara Wellington with the high of 20 degrees and Faka Oriore Mastodon, 23. Now to the central plateau you can expect the cloudy periods and showers scattered throughout the day. Toa 4 on 18 degrees and Fonganui winning on 23. To the east coast you have cloud coverage with rainfall expected to clear in the afternoon. Tauranga and Ahurri-Napia both on 21 degrees. And to the top of our country, Otearoa, a wet day with showers, possible thunderstorms, coupled with some north-easterly winds, Damaki-McKoroa, Auckland, 24 degrees, and Keri-Ror, Hamilton, 21. Woo! Oh, she's so windy, but it hasn't stopped people from coming out and walking their dogs this morning. Unreal. It's a great determination out there to get out in the elements. It looks pretty grey, doesn't it? Whoa. Beautiful beach, though, there Mairangi Bay. And William, while we've got you, I just wanted to ask you some questions about road trip etiquette because you go on quite a fair few road trips around the country and your role as our weather presenter. Yeah. Now one of the questions I want to ask, I'm going to ask all of you actually, if you are a front seat passenger, are you allowed to go to sleep? I always go to sleep if you ask Taylor. I'm always going to sleep straight away. So as soon as we jump in the car, I'm asleep for like four hours, five hours. She's like, oh, thanks to you, an awesome auto. What do you call it? Co-pilot. Co-pilot, co-pilot, co-pilot. Auto-pilot. Always asleep. That would be a very bad. Bad or a pilot. Thanks very much, William. We'll come back to you a little later on. How about you too? Or if you're a wife, you are the backseat driver, but you're on the front. We had this conversation last night driving back from Mount Munganui, and it was, is it okay to fall asleep in the front? We had this exact conversation. And I never do it. It's moral support for the driver. I absolutely believe that. Bernardine, you work from 3.30 in the morning. You're up at 3 o'clock. You then go all the way up and down the country for the rugby. You deserve a nap. Take it while you can get it. I don't care what he says, you deserve a nap. And let's out on driver assisting? Never. Okay, who though? Who has final say over music in the car, Ryan? Is it the passenger or driver? Well, it's always the one who's trying to sleep. So I've always said, if I'm trying to nap, you must turn everything down. Oh, I thought it would be the other person who'd get to entertain themselves. Oh, that road trip etiquette is terrible. Okay, Bernardine, windows up or down? Up. That's what I see is for. Yeah, totally. And it's annoying when someone puts the window down a bit because then you get that awful sound. You've got to balance it out. You've got to have the window on the other side, both down an inch, and that's the way to cut that. Yeah, but it depends if you've got the chopper window. There's always one window that's a chopper window that sounds like the helicopter. You know the sound? That's the awful sound. That one needs to be close, but the others, I think, is okay to be. I think you're going slow along the beach, like 50Ks, cruising windows down. Smell the side of the air. Passing lane, you're driving in the left. It's bumper-to-bumper, steady stream of traffic, but you can see in front of you that there's a camper van or a few cars that are going to be slower than you when the road opens up. Yes. Do you pull out to the right and try and overtake those cars? Nail it, yes. You don't stay with a steady stream of traffic? No, you know, if you can do so within... That's what's from passing lanes for, isn't it? Yeah, passing. What if you're all bumper? Everyone's just cruising along at a good speed. I don't care. No, that's all right, then. If you're happy, and you're? Yeah, passing. What if you're all bumping, everyone's just cruising along at a good speed? I don't care. No, that's all right then. If you're happy, if you're cruising along, fine. And if you can do so in a safe speed within the speed limit and get past them all, it's their fault going to slow. But then you're just going to create the bottleneck at the top of the... Like, everyone should just stay there if it's bumper to bumper. The beauty of the bottleneck is if you're at the top of it, it doesn't matter. Right, it is 17 away from 7. After the break, we get the latest on the situation. In Ukraine, it's fighting intensifies. Stay with us. We'll be back. Take you down. And oh, we can swallow you home. I say one day, oh, boy, you're going to... Keep an eye on the cake, and don't eat any of the chocolate or the smarties. When you're not there, do your kids do as they're told? Did any of you eat some of the decorations? No. All power and resilience. I'm so scared. You're not going to fall. I promise you.

Good morning and welcome back to our partner's chorus. It is 13 minutes from 7. Russia has intensified its attack on Ukraine with Marieupol on the brink of collapse and deadly missile strikes on the western city of Lviv. To tell us more, I'm joined by NewsHub Europe correspondent, Liszt, Rameh. Lyset, good morning. Good morning. Let's start with those attacks on Lviviv. We've seen very isolated attacks on that very western city of Ukraine before. What's different this time? Yes, Lviv is really a safe haven for people, and it has been largely left alone. For example, that is one of the places we based ourselves when we were there because we knew it to be a place that wasn't a direct target for Russia. It's far on the west. It's very close to Poland, which means it's very close to triggering any sort of attack from NATO if it were to go over that border. Now they've come out and they've had four missile strikes there in the West overnight. Seven people have died at least another 11 have been wounded and that includes a young child. So it is incredibly alarming to see this change and it does signal that Russia has now started to be a little bit more random with their attacks. Yeah, and so close to Poland. This is the other concerning thing, surely, for NATO? Yes, definitely. That is what everyone kind of raises the red flag whenever they get anywhere near Leviv, is that it is so, so close to the border. And if it were to go a little bit to the left, instantly it's on Poland land, and then you have a situation where NATO has said it will have to get involved because it is always going to defend the NATO membership countries. And Ukrainian soldiers, veterans have been taking part in the Invictus Games and have spoken to Prince Harry. Yeah, this has been a really special occasion. The Invictus Games obviously are very close to Prince Harry's heart. He started them. They are dedicated to helping the rehab of veterans and also active servicemen and service women. And the Ukrainian team has been able to compete. So there's been 19 Ukrainians. Some of those are men who are actively serving in this current war, who were given special permission by President Zelensky to leave the country. Remember, men can't leave at the moment between the ages of 18 and 65 because they're considered to be active fighting men. These men have been given special permission to leave and attend these games and compete. And what's remarkable about it is some of these men, These men have been given special permission to leave and attend these games and compete. And what's remarkable about it is some of these men, their wives have been sent. For example, one of them was sent to Lithuania and they've been able to catch up in the Netherlands just this week while he competes in the Invictus Games. She was able to fly to the Netherlands, meet up with him, he was able to see his children and after these games finished, she'll be heading back to Ukraine to continue to fight. But Prince Harry has just praised them for their bravery, their courage for making this trip and continuing to tell their truth on the world stage. That's nice to hear. Ten minutes away from seven, we're speaking to our News Hub Europe correspondent Leesette Raymer, live in London this morning. Leesette will finish on Emmanuel Mahon, the current French president who hopes to remain so. There's obviously an election on, but he's trying to get the young voters out to vote. So what's you doing? Yes, and boy has he caused a stir online. Take a look at this picture that was posted. It was a behind the scenes shot of him lounging down on the couch, very relaxed, and he has unbuttoned his shirt fairly dramatically. And a lot of the kids are accusing him of, you know, posting what they call a bit of a thirst trap is what I'm told it's called causing a little bit of a stir online goodness me there's a big old motorbike protest coming by they must have heard about the Macron I must have heard about the Macron photo in their rushing to have to look at it on Twitter I can picture a Manuel Marathon with his hair out on one of those motorbikes his head he's so hairy Ryan I wasn't going to go picture Emmanuel Mahon with his hair out on one of those motorbikes, Lisa. He's so hairy, Ryan. I wasn't going to go on there. It's staggering. And people are like, is that real hair? So now all the young kids are like, now he's just photoshopping his photos to make him look more manly. They're like, Emmanuel, before? Well, he's certainly everybody's like please please no one tell Boris Johnson to do it like it's really worried that Boris Johnson it's not quite the same when it's wispy white here is it but better than Putin I'd have to say hey thanks so much for you reporting this morning news have Europe correspondent Lesette Raymer in the thick of it from London this morning it's eight minutes away correspondent, Lesette Raymer, in the thick of it from London this morning. It's eight minutes away from seven. I can see why it caused a bit of a stir that photo. Whoa, what a rug. It is a rug. I mean, you need a weed whacker to get rid of that, wouldn't you? You need a run up with a big pot of wax. Attractive, though. Really? Yeah, I think there's something about the photo that's fighting over him. Well, you wouldn't need winter sheets on the bed, you do. Snuggle up to that rug. Human electric blanket. Eight minutes from seven now.

Batteries are your local battery experts. The Black Ferns are without a coach. After a damning review into team management and culture, six months out from the World Cup, so we're two from here for the team. Rugby commentator Alice Soper joins us now to discuss. Ellis, thanks very much for joining us. Tell us what is it that the players want right now? Oh well look I couldn't speak for the players but I could speak for the fans and myself which is we need our plan and we need to make our way forward. We've got this one opportunity now. Let's go big so we can bring this home. So we've got Wayne Smith and Sir Graham Henry in the mix now, not as coaches, but working with the team. Is it as simple, though, as taking the culture that has been formed around the men's team and trying to make it work in the women's team, or is it not that simple? No, I think it's about embracing the unique and beautiful parts of the women's game. I think there's actually a lot that women's rugby could be teaching the mainstream about how to do things. We come from a different background. We are a reflection of those who've built us. So we have a lot more influence from our Māori and our Pacific players around how we shape and run our rugby, and I'd love to see that carried across into our top team. And within sports teams or within any business or industry, I guess, a group of women operate in different ways to men. Has that been part of the issue here in terms of treatment of this team? I think we've just had a situation here where our growth has rapidly outstripped the support systems that have been put in place. And this isn't something that's new to maybe loud voices such as mine who have been trying to raise this issue for a wee while. But I think this is our moment in time to be sitting down and pulling the stakeholders together, pulling people like myself and the group that I work with, women in rugby, Al-Tiroa, to the table, and having these conversations about how a successful women's program would look in New Zealand today. And six months out from the World Cup, which is such an important opportunity for women's rugby, has this review and the revelations about this damning culture done reputational damage to the World Cup? Or can it be repaired? Well, look, I think it's a case of we now know it. So we've named it. Now we've got to tame it. And the rest of the world will be watching New Zealand rugby's next steps. So our challenge, I guess, here, is for us to lead the way, just like we want to on the field, take those steps forward off it. You know, we've had a situation with hybrid contracts, and now we've got a handful of fully professional. But we want all people that are involved in women's rugby, not just the players, to be able to make it their full-time job. A lot of the issues have come from the fact that people are given women's rugby as another responsibility on top of a long to-do list. So we've got to have this dedicated resource, to have that dedicated resource So we've got to have this dedicated resource. To have that dedicated resource, we've got to have a strategic plan. To have a strategic plan, we're going to have the business case. I'm not going to pretend it's not going to cost money. But let's do the numbers and let's do this properly. Hopefully it gets people only more interested. Rugby commentator Alice Soper, appreciate your time this morning. Yeah, it's a hard one, isn't that? Because you do need the money and there's only so much money to go around, isn't there when it comes to sport? It's not like everyone can just... We're hosting the rugby World Cup and, you know, are we serious about supporting this women's team or not? It takes money. We had the cricket women's World Cup, didn't we too? I mean, how much are we throwing at that? Probably not a hell of a lot, I wouldn't think? I don't know. If there's only so much money to go around, I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it? Right now, it is 7 o'clock, and this is AM. No-my, hi-My, it's Tuesday, the 19th of April, you're with AM, and it is great to have you with us this morning. Mortgage rates, as-emai, it's Tuesday the 19th of April. You're with AM and it is great to have you with us this morning. Mortgage rates, as you probably know, are on the rise. And food prices too are at record highs. Inflation is tipped to be the highest. It's been in more than 30 years. So we put the cost of living crisis to Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson at 740. Our cruise ship industry is desperate to get back to business but is still not got a firm date on when maritime borders will be open in this country. The New Zealand Cruise Ship Association is with us to discuss in 10 minutes time. As Russia intensifies its attack on Ukraine, it continues to shield its people from the alleged atrocities it's committing. We talk to a man who's dedicated to stopping the spread of misinformation. That's in 20 minutes. And it's 100 days today until the Commonwealth Games get underway in Birmingham. Triathlete Hayden Wild is with us this morning to talk about his medal hopes. That's just before 8. Right now, it's time for your news. Atmarie, it's 7 o'clock. Four people have died on Ahttyero's roads this long weekend, with the Easter holiday road toll officially ending at 6 this morning. The fourth death came in a crash near Dunedin overnight. State Highway 1 near Carlton Hill remains closed after the accident, which occurred shortly after 9. Last year's Easter road toll ended with seven fatalities. Inspector Peter McKinney told AM to successfully meet the government's Road to Zero campaign. Drivers need to stay vigilant. Things happen unexpectedly. People make mistakes. That's human nature. We can't avoid that. We just need everyone to be alert on the roads and be aware of hazards and be in a position to drive in a manner that enables you to slow down and avoid a crash when the unexpected occurs in front of you. Inspector McKenney warns drivers not to be complacent over the coming weeks with the school holidays and the Anzac long weekend just around the corner. Prime Minister Jacinda Dern has arrived in Singapore touching down on her first overseas trip since the COVID pandemic began. News how political reporter Amelia Wade is travelling with the PM and sent this report. After touching down here in Singapore the Prime Minister is set to have her first overseas grip and grin since the start of the COVID pandemic more than two years ago. She's off to the Astana to meet with the President and the Prime Minister. They're talking about China, Ukraine and the trade partnership that we are both in, the CPTPP, and how to entice the United States to it. The schedule here is absolutely jam-packed in showing off New Zealand's finest to make sure the Prime Minister keeps her promise to give New Zealand good bang for its buck with this trip. Russia's assault on Ukraine has spread to its western border as missiles hit the previously untouched city of Lovue. At least seven people have been killed in a series of Russian missile strikes, the first civilian victims in the western city. It comes as Ukrainian officials warn that threats of an attack on the country's east are now becoming a reality with more missile strikes reported in Kharkiv. United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths says despite ongoing efforts to stop the violence, he isn't optimistic. Obviously, we have not yet got humanitarian ceasefires in place on the Russian side. I went into a lot of detail on this and they continue to promise to get back to me on the details of those proposals. Meanwhile, Russian efforts to take the Port City of Murayupol are ramping up, trapping nearly 100,000 civilians in the city. 10,000 troops have been deployed to Durban in South Africa as the desperate hunt for flood survivors enters its second week. Historic rainfall carved through villages and cliffsides early last week, washing out roads, homes and entire city blocks. The death toll stands at 443 with more than 60 people still missing. Authorities say police dogs are among the latest recruits in the ongoing search with locals saying the minutes feel like ours. Things are really bad here. We've found a son who has been taken to the morgue and we are confused about what to do with his remains while we haven't found his mother. We think she's been swept away. It's hoped fresh rescue crews will be able to reach more remote areas. In sports, suspensions have come thick and fast for Kiwi Super Rugby teams with Scott Barrett, Asafo Amor and Josh Dixon facing lengthy bans. Barrett has been suspended for four weeks after pleading guilty to a high tackle on blues prop, Alex Hodgman, earned the Crusader's 27 to 23 defeat to the Blues. The judiciary reduced his ban from six to four weeks, meaning he'll be back in time for their home game against Fiji in Drou in late May. Dixon and Amour have both copped three-week suspensions following separate incidents in the Hurricanes 21 to 20 win over the Highlanders on Saturday. New Zealand squash ace, Joelle King, has knocked over top seed, Sarah Jane Perry, to win the the Highlanders on Saturday. New Zealand squash ace. Joelle King has knocked over top seats Sarah Jane Perry to win the Manchester Open. It was a confidence-boasting performance for King who eased past her opponent in straight games winning her first title since 2019. Having been away from New Zealand for three years, the 33-year-old says it means a lot to be crown champion. This week has been a rollercoaster. My body has been in bits, and people have been putting me back together, so I'm just, yeah, I'm emotional because it means so much. Amazing effort. That's the very latest from NewsHub. It is six past seven. It is wonderful to see. Thanks very much, Bernadine. This morning, lots of your feedback coming in thick and fast about the state of our roads. We're asking, is it the road's fault that we have crashes or is it the driver's fault that we have crashes? The Simkin family from Taupor have emailed this morning. Good morning. They say the road from Taupor to Tokoroa is full of potholes that have been there for a very long time, very dangerous. And as you try to avoid them, people have crashes. However, Michael says I gave up being a truck driver because a lot of people don't know how to drive. Passing on corners, yellow lines, speeding through small towns is a big one for him. So, I mean, everyone's got their own opinion, don't they, I suppose? Speed is part of the problem too, isn't it? And Glenn says, why don't we put up more point-to-point speed cameras which measure your speed over a said distance, put them up all over in New Zealand, especially in the black spots around the country. I've been in countries where this works because you can't just speed up and slow down when you think there's a camera. You actually have to stay consistent to the speed limit over a certain section. Good point. I imagine a man who's never spared a car in his life is William, and he's with us for weather this morning at 7 after 7. William, good morning. Morena, yes, I'm here, I haven't sped, I'm always keep to the road rules. It's one of the staples. I'm down here at AUT Millennium Track and I'm just happy to be out of the wind. It's quite windy earlier on, but now there's just a little light rain coming through here but hey let's check out the weather at your place tomorrow's weather brought to by nature turn it to power by meridian an orange heavy rain warning is in place for Coramandel Peninsula. Expect up to 120 millimetres of rain in areas with large amounts of surface water and thunderstorms. There are also heavy rain watches in eastern part of Auckland, the Bay of Plenty and Pasta Fjordland this morning. Now to the rest of your weather.

To the east coast, you have cloud coverage with rainfall expected to clear in the afternoon, Tauranga and Ahuriri Mapia, both on 21 degrees. And to the top of our country, Altearoa, a wet day with showers, possible thunderstorms, coupled with some northeasterly winds, Damaki Makoto, Auckland, 24 degrees and Keri-Roa, Hamilton, 21. Yeah, there's a reason why we're down at the track. The Commonwealth Games are 100 days away and we're about to catch up. In about half an hour, 45 minutes time, I'm going to catch up with Hayden Wilde, Tokyo bronze medalists from the triathlon, so I better get warmed up, ready to catch up with him. Those hurdles give me PTSD because I used to love school sports days, but it was the hurdles that got me. I've only got small little legs, and so there were a couple of times where I just went up and straight back down onto my face. Yeah they are out there. You're a braver man than me if you're going to try the hurdles. Thanks very much William. But the fact that you're going to do it in the rain is going to be great television, William. I'm looking forward to this. Bikes on. Jumping the hurdles. He hasn't even said that he's going to but we've now bullied him into it. Definitely going to happen. Thanks William. We'll look forward to the hurdling later on. Right. Our cruise ship industry is desperate to get back to business after more than two years being at a standstill. But there's frustration that no clear timeline has been given to open up our maritime borders. New Zealand's Cruise Association CEO, Kevin O'Sullivan, joins us. Good morning, Kevin. Thanks for being with us. Has the cruise industry opened worldwide? Yes, it has. Around about, more than 80 countries have opened to cruise. And Australia, yesterday, welcome the first cruise ship back into Sydney Harbour. The Pacific Explorer arrived to enormous fanfare and a great deal of celebration from the Australian cruise industry. Right. So when have you been told, or what have you been told, about when they'll be welcome here? Very little. We've been in discussions with government agencies since December last year, and we've worked through all the necessary protocols that you would expect. I understand that a decision has been made by government ministers, but we need an announcement. We need it announced really, really soon, because without that announcement, that formal announcement from government, we're finding that cruise ships are unable to be confirmed and we're already losing more than 180 port bookings because of a lack of clarity. And you're off to a meeting this week in which the cruise industry is discussing whether it is open around the world. What are you going to say about what the situation is in New Zealand? Yeah, well, I'm on it. It's the largest cruise conference and exhibition in the world. It's on in Miami beginning next week. I'm heading away there at the end of this week. I'm on a panel, and the panel has got my colleagues from Australasia, but also from other parts of the world as well. And we'll all be discussing how we're going to, how we're working, how it's going to start, how it's working in the rest of the world. So poor New Zealand, namely me, will be standing up, I hope not to, but standing up with a great deal of embarrassment in saying, look, we're not open yet and we don't know when. So we really need government to make an announcement. Do it now, do it today, you know, stop them. So what is your deadline? You leave this week. What is your deadline to avoid embarrassment? My deadline, I guess, is probably immediately, really, because I'm already writing notes and putting them into the panel, after all. So I really need it this week. I mean, we're already on Tuesday. I'm leaving on Thursday. Please, please, please, government, let us know. Give us a date. And what does this cost us? Because I imagine you need to know by a certain time so that you can start planning the summer arrivals. At what point are you having to cancel for next summer? The close-off date really is around about four months out, but cruise lines have already cancelled. We've already lost cancellations during our winter cruise season, and we've lost some of the port calls over the summer season as well because of that lack of clarity. So they need at least a good four months, ideally more, for planning. And it's not just the cruise lines. There's all the regional operators around New Zealand, the desperate for crews to come back. There's cruise passengers. They want to book. They want to know, are we sailing around New Zealand or aren't we? Well, it is their demand, because, you know, COVID, I wonder whether that has impacted demand from your passengers who, I would presume, mostly around, say, 50s, 60s, you know, more in the middle ages, I guess, of life. Have they been put off by cruising with COVID? No, no, not at all. World demand is huge and increasing. Once a date was given for Australia, then there's a great deal of demand generated there. And bookings are enormous. And are we going to miss out on that? Are we going to miss out on demand if we say delay for another month before we announce the opening? Yeah, people will book elsewhere. Cruises want to cruise. And if they can't cruise around New Zealand, I'll cruise elsewhere. New Zealand's Cruise Association CEO, Kevin O'Sullivan. Kevin, thanks very much for being with us this morning. And best of luck with that conference in Miami. Thankfully, we have the Deputy Prime Minister, of course, Jacinda Adirons, overseas, selling us as a tourist destination to Asia right now. How ridiculous is this? She's made a decision, according to our guest. She made a decision about whether we will open our maritime borders, just has forgotten to tell anyone. So off we go to this conference, can you imagine how embarrassing that would be with everybody else in the world opening and oh no New Zealand can't remember or forgot to tell or Yes everybody else is able to come here but we're just not sure when the boats can come in This is an industry It's worth more than half a billion dollars To the New Zealand economy Before we had COVID There were about 300,000 cruise ship passengers coming here. It's huge So hopefully we'll get something out of the minister this morning. Interesting what it's done to the Auckland CBD though, which is hugely dependent on those cruise ship passengers. And we have seen an increase in violent crime there after hours. And the cruise ship companies are now saying that when cruise ships do dock, they are going to have to warn their passengers that perhaps be careful if you're going out after certain hours in Auckland CBD. That's embarrassing. Isn't it? It's like when you arrive in Rio and they say, you know, pickpocketers and be careful and that's Auckland City now, apparently. 16 minutes after 7 now, we would love your feedback on this one too. Feedback at amshow.com.n.Z. I know there are particularly a lot of cruise enthusiasts out there who'll be interested. Feedback at amshow.com.

If you're all right, thanks for doing us, I'm going to be beautiful this morning. We're all just admiring Wellington, aren't we? Beautiful this morning. Right, 21 after 7, as you say, as Russia intensifies its assault on Ukraine. It continues its disinformation campaign on home soil. Since its invasion in February, Moscow has ramped up its propaganda efforts to shield its people from the atrocities being committed. Eurasian Democracy Initiative Director, Peter Zamev, has made it his mission to get the truth out there, and he joins me now. Good morning. Good morning. Peter, tell me what your job is. Your job is basically to try and counter Moscow's propaganda. How do you do that? Well, a few of my colleagues, some of them from Russia, one of them is a former Russian MP, who is now a Ukrainian citizen. We basically set up a YouTube channel. We're broadcasting from one of the Ukrainian towns not too far from Kiev. And we, you know, we're trying to get the word out about our channel to grow in numbers. We already have over 40,000 subscribers. Some of our, you know, videos have garnered over 100,000 views. You know, we have this, you know, 10-hour-long stream every day where we interview Russian exiles, Ukrainian military experts, everything. And we also double up through telegram channels, et cetera. What you just said before, you know, yes, indeed, Putin has imposed an informational blockade on the Russians. But still, you know, the use of telegram channels has probably tripled in Russia since then. People do get tired of a state-run TV. And so there is an opportunity to try to get the, you know, the true story into the public. For those who aren't familiar, Telegram is like a private messaging service where people do it direct and between each other rather than online or through a mainstream means, which is very interesting. How do you, because obviously Russians are, and you're broadcasting in Russian, but they're used to propaganda. They expect propaganda. Would they not think what you're producing is also propaganda? You know, how do you try and present truth to a group of people who are so conditioned to propaganda? Well, we are in an open market of ideas, obviously, and it's a battle of information and informational strategies that is going on parallel to the actual military battle. And so far, I can tell you that worldwide, Ukraine has been having a victory, one victory after another, as far as getting the narrative out, getting its story out. The bulk of the world's population is on Ukraine's side, obviously, with some exceptions, of course. But yes, when it comes to the Russians, it's a pretty bad disease you're dealing with. You know, you would think that with the proliferation of these modern technologies, we would put this Orwellian kind of world behind, and people would get this unvarnished truth, and this myriad of international sources would create a better environment. Well, the opposite has happened. Russians have perfected this kind of shock and awe, informational kind of campaign of throwing every little bit of truth and untruth and everything in between, you know, it's just mixing it up to where people are just confused in Russia. They're really, really sick. Are they confused? You know, are they confused or is it just easier to not think about it, you know, to ingest what you're being told and just not think about it too much? I mean, it's a very, very precise question you're asking. It's really, it hits the nail on its head because it's probably a combination of the two. At some point, you stop questioning what's real, what's not, because some of it, like the massacre in Bucha, it is definitely easier for you when you're Russian, if you're Russian, to believe that it was staged. It was play-acted by Ukrainians, and Russians were unfairly playing, obviously. And we saw that in Nazi Germany. And you know, the president in Nazi Germany is not too encouraging. The war was over in 1945, but it took some Germans until the early 1960s to start to come to grips with what that country did. Yeah, because it was basically brainwashed. It was conditioned. Peter, thank you very much for your time this morning. It's been interesting. Thank you so much. Talking to you, your Asian Democracy Initiative Director, Peter Zelmaev, with us from just outside of Kyiv this morning. The time is 25 after 7. Still to come on the show, Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson is here. He's in charge of the government purse strings. Will budget spending be impacted by expected record high inflation?

Thanks for joining us on AM this morning and thank you so much to our partner's chorus as well. It's great to have your company this morning. Right now, it's time for your news. Morina, good morning. It's 7.30. State Highway 1 is closed near Coulton Hill, south of Dunedin, after a fatal accident overnight. Emergency services responded to the single car crash. Shortly after nine, the driver died at the scene. The death takes the Easter Holiday Road, Tolter, four, nearly half that of last years. Inspector Peter McKinney told AM to successfully meet the government's Road to Zero campaign. Drivers need to stay vigilant. Things happen unexpectedly. People make mistakes. That's human nature. We can't avoid that. We just need everyone to be alert on the roads and be aware of hazards and be in a position to drive in a manner that enables you to slow down and avoid a crash when the unexpected occurs in front of you. Inspector McKinney warns drivers not to be complacent over the coming weeks with the school holidays and the Anzac long weekend just around the corner. The search for a fisherman missing off the east coast near a porticoe will resume this morning. The man was reported missing after failing to return home on Sunday afternoon from a fishing trip at Toorri in the Bay of Plenty. The search area stretches from Toorri to north of Makatu. Police are asking people to keep an eye out for items such as a 100-liter chili bin, wooden ores and a yellow life jacket. Coast card, surf lifesaving and rescue helicopters are expected to join the search today. A wave of changes on the cards for the black ferns after the resignation of head coach Glenn Moore, just six months up from the Women's Rugby World Cup. It follows a damning report into the culture of women's rugby at the elite level. It found that changes were needed for the welfare of the players. Commentator Alice Soper says it's now time to embrace the growth of the game. I think we've just had a situation here where our growth has rapidly outstripped the support systems that have been put in place. And this isn't something that's new to maybe loud voices such as mine who have been trying to raise this issue for a wee wire. The Pope has been told by Ukrainian Marines in Maripol is what hell on earth looks like. Russian reinforcements have joined the battle for the Port City, trapping 100,000 civilians in the line of fire. Despite the bombardment, Ukrainian troops are holding on, with officials warning if they fall or fail, few troops will make it out alive. Ukrainian Defence Ministry spokesman Alexander Mahutsjong says, while it's tough, it's keeping the Russian forces occupied. Mariupol has attracted a very large enemy force, and in fact the way the defenders of this city are holding on, it prevents Russia from relocating these units to other directions, but it comes at a cost. Thousands are dead. And a not-for-profit organization targeting Russian propaganda has taken its fight online. Peter Zalmayev has been creating YouTube videos telling the story of what's happening in Ukraine in the Russian language. He says levels of interest in private messaging apps is growing, proving people are wanting to hear alternative sides of the story. The use of telegram channels has probably tripled in Russia since then. People do get tired of a state-run TV. And so there is an opportunity to try to get the true story into the public. Attempts to save a drowning puppy in Australia's northern territory has been described as the most Aussie rescue ever. Grabbing the first things they could find, Onlook was wrangled some pool toys in the shape of a crocodile and a jandal or a thong, as call it in Ozzy and they then jumped into a weed infested lake to save the struggling pup apart from a couple of scratches Jackson the Poach is now safe and sound and he's doing okay all right in sports news the West Tigers have finally recorded their first win of the NRL season with an epic 2120 upset victory over the Parramatta Eels. With the scores locked at 20 all in time on the clock counting down, playmaker Jackson Hastings launched a 38 metre field goal to clinch a one point victory. Hastings' efforts stunned the crowd and helped lift the tigers off the bottom of the ladder. The central pulse have bounced back from their loss last week, thrashing the magic 5239 to pick up their third win of the A. The central pulse have bounced back from their loss last week, thrashing the Magic 5239 to pick up their third win of the A&Z Premiership season. The pass were dominant from the start to finish thanks to some sharp shooting from Alia Dunn, a solid defensive effort from Captain Kelly Jury. Despite missing their full frontline team, the Magic can take some positives away from the match with Silverfern shooter Amelian Ecanacio playing her first full match. Manchester United Star, Cristiano Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez have announced that their baby boy has died. The couple were expecting twins but only one survived saying it's the greatest pain that any parents can feel. Ronaldo said the birth of his baby girl gives us the strength to live in this moment with some hope and happiness. Not the cheeriest thing to end a sports bulletin on, but yeah, news hub, 25 to 8. Yeah, very sad for them and for his family as well. 25 to 8, as you say. Right, we're going to go to William for weather very shortly. But first, would you like to go on a cruise? Well, you can't. Not from here. No one can come into New Zealand and go on a cruise because our maritime border is sealed shut still. And there's no time frame yet, is there. We've heard from our guest at 7. No time frame on when that might open. So there is huge demand as Kevin O'Sullivan, the New Zealand Cruise Association CEO, told us, there is huge demand from people across the world to go cruising, but they're looking elsewhere. And we've had feedback here from Kaipater Girl. Thank you for writing to us from Kaipater, who says, hi, I booked an Australian cruise weeks ago. Can't wait for New Zealand to stuff me around anymore. There you go. That's fair enough, isn't it? I've just been onto one of the big cruise lines. I won't say which one. P&O. And looked for when I can next book a cruise. And the first available date is Tuesday, the 15th of November. So obviously this whole sort of season has been wiped out, but still they don't know when that border will open. So we're going to ask Grant Robertson about that in about a minute and a half. Right now though, we're going to check on the weather with William. William, you'd be into cruising, wouldn't you, mate? Yeah, I haven't been on a cruise and it's something I'd love to do. More than everybody, and yes, please, if you can hook me up with a cruise, Ryan, it'll be absolutely fantastic. But I'm inside the AUT Millennium where it's all going here. Nice, a lot warmer, a lot warmer than being outside in the wind, the rain. But hey, let's check out the weather around the motu. Tomorrow's weather brought to by nature. Turn it to power by Meridian. An orange heavy rain morning is in place for the Coramandal Peninsula. Expect up to 120 millimetres of rain in areas with large amounts of surface water and thunderstorms. There are also heavy rain watches in eastern parts of Auckland, the Bay of Plenty and part of field in this morning. Now to the rest of your weather. A fine day in the lower south with cloudy periods and light winds throughout. Orte Poti Daneer on 20 degrees and Tahuna, Queenstown, you're on 17. To the west coast, a cloudy day for you sprinkled with a few showers and light winds. Peelpeel Tahi, Milford Sound, 17, and Kawateri Westport, the high of 21. In Canterbury and Marlborough, a fine day with some evening cloud and possible showers, or Tautahi crash shirts on 20 degrees, and Hakatere Ashburden, 19. A mostly fine day in the lower north with morning cloud cover increasing throughout the day to Fanganui Atara Wellington with a high of 20 degrees and Faka Oriori Masterin, 23. Now to the central plateau, you can expect cloudy periods and showers scattered throughout the day, Taupo, 18 degrees and Fanganoi winning on 23. To the east coast you have cloud coverage with rainfall expected to clear in the afternoon, Tauranga and Ahuri, Napier, both on 21 degrees. And to the top of our country, Altearoa, a wet day with showers, possible thunderstorms, coupled with some nor, easterly winds, Damakimakuro, Auckland, 24 degrees, and Keri Roa, Hamilton, 21. Okay, guys, we are in AUT as I said earlier Millennium in the North Shore we're going to be catching up with Hayden Wild very soon and just picking his brain 100 days to go to the common game so stay with us exciting times William thanks very much we will check in with you a little bit later on now the cost of living crisis continues to bikes for everyday New Zealanders food prices have hit a record high mortgage rates are on the rise and inflation this week predicted to hit the highest in over 30 years. For more on this, Deputy Prime Minister, Grant Robertson. And, Minister, we will get to inflation very shortly. But I just want to talk to you first this morning about Kevin O'Sullivan, who is the New Zealand Cruise Association CEO. He joins us this morning to say he faces embarrassment this week, heading over to the International Cruise Conference in Miami, and the rest of the world has opened up, but he has no information on when our maritime border is going to open, despite believing that there has already been a decision made. Is there any reason we can't save him and New Zealand from that embarrassment? Well, good morning, Melissa. There hasn't been a decision made. The government's been working through how we can safely open our maritime border. As you'll be aware, we've always taken the advice of our public health officials that's served New Zealand pretty well. We're still waiting on some of that advice from our health officials. We're very well aware that particularly for New Zealand, the cruise season is the summer season, so we do want to give people plenty of notice, and we expect to be able to say something in the next few weeks. But we've tried to work really hard on behalf of New Zealand businesses and workers and households to make sure we do the right thing from a health perspective and an economic perspective, and we're not far away from being able to make that decision and give that advice through to Kevin and those who are affected by it. A few weeks, maybe a few weeks too late, it could potentially lose us millions. Pre-pandemic, $565 million worth of spending was attributed to the cruise industry in the year to June 2019. For the sake of making a decision now so that he can go to that cruise conference, why can't we just decide? The borders are opening to visa waiver tourists from May 1st. Yeah, and look, obviously, you know, different types of tourism have different impacts and we've all aware of the impact that those cruise ships had in the early stages of the pandemic. They were places where COVID-19 spread quickly and caused us some issues even at the beginning, if you recall. So we will step through this carefully. We've always made sure we put New Zealand as health and safety is our first and most paramount thing, but we recognise that there are economic impacts here. We're awaiting some final advice from our health officials and we'll just announce it as soon as we can. As you note, we do have people coming in across the air border. We've got Australians here, got people from visa waiver countries coming shortly. But equally, this is mainly our summer-based industry and so we'll make sure that there's plenty of time for people to be able to know what's happening in terms of that. Aren't those cruise ships effectively floating MIQ hotels though? You could have people on there and they have to test before they can leave? I mean, if anything, we know that we can test people and get them into the economy safely now. And look, that may well be a part of what occurs when tourist ships come back into New Zealand, as you say. We've got the testing now with rapid antigen tests that enable us to move pretty quickly, and that may well be part of what we do. Is the decision currently not being made because the Prime Minister is visiting Asia instead? No, that's not the case. We've got a cabinet meeting today. We're getting on with the business of what we're doing. No, the reason is that we're awaiting some further advice from health officials. As soon as we get that, we'll be in a position to make a decision and announce it. Okay, so the decision can be made still while the Prime Minister is away? For sure, yep. As I say, we have a cabinet meeting today where a number of decisions will be made, but we are still awaiting that specific advice on cruise ships. Okay, let's go to inflation because economists are predicting that it will rise above 7% later this week, which is the highest. It's been in about 30 years. We had Cameron Bagri on this morning saying, look, one way to curb that is to cut back on government spending. There's a budget in exactly a month. Have you looked at cutting back on that spending given the developments in terms of the inflation rate? Yeah, look, we always try to strike a careful balance with our spending, but we're not going to lower the price of food by cutting health spending. And a big part of this budget will be how we set ourselves up for a new health system that's going to deliver to people wherever they live in New Zealand. Over the course of the last couple of years, we have invested significantly to support New Zealanders. The money we spent was on the wage subsidy scheme and the resurgent support payment and all these ways that we've protected and supported New Zealand households and businesses. I think New Zealanders have appreciated that. Our spending is now much more targeted when it comes to COVID, and we will be careful about that. But the other side of the coin is we still need to invest in our health system, our education system, to build housing. We've got to keep doing that. We'll strike a balance. On the other side of the ledge of the Reserve Bank, their job is to control inflation, and obviously they're making their moves in that regard. Okay, so when you say you're going to strike a balance, does that mean that extra $6 billion in spending might not actually be fully spent? Are you pulling back on that now? Well, as I say, a big chunk of that is a one-off increase for health spending. And people will be aware that we're getting rid of the district health boards. We're resetting the clock for our health system. We're investing significantly in areas where there have been big inequities such as for Māori. This is an area where we've got to be able to invest now to make sure that system gets off on the right foot. That's a one-off. In future years, the level of new operating allowances is much more back where we've been in the last few years. So I think New Zealanders understand there's a balance to be had here. You cut your nose off to spite your face if you decide to not build any more state houses for a few years because that just makes housing problems worse. So we understand the importance of striking a balance, but we won't attack the issues where inflation is the worst by not spending on health. Where it's the worst is in areas like fuel and fuel influences everything, including the prices that you pay at the supermarket. It's the supply chain constraints on building supplies. All around the world, Melissa, you're seeing inflation up at these levels, 7% in the UK, 8% of the US. Indeed, although Australia's rate is only half of New Zealand's inflation. So it can't fully be imported if that situation is there in comparison to New Zealand's 7% we're expecting this week. Well, different economies have different drivers. In Australia, they have a lot more of their own energy that they produce. They're a net exporter of energy, so that gives them a slightly different basis to be moving from. They're at a slightly different stage of the pandemic. But equally, their inflation numbers come out next week and are also projected to be up around those record levels. This is a global issue. We have to work hard in New Zealand to make sure that we manage that. The Reserve Bank have the job of keeping inflation down, but we will also always take a careful and balanced approach when it comes to our spending. And I think on spending, people recognise that they are being asked to curb their own spending. But I think what people are also looking to see is that the government budget spending is curbs so that everybody is, I guess, in the same boat. There's a couple that we heard about here on AM last week who have a mortgage of 550,000. They have rates that were 2.29% that have now risen to 5.25. So they're paying an extra $920 a month. That's 11,000 a year. What do you say to this couple? Is this a government that's going to put more money back into their pocket or are you saying you have to suck it up because of the inflation at the moment? Well, as I say, inflation is a global phenomenon and clearly rates of inflation are projected not only to be at the record levels you're talking about for this quarter, but now economists are saying perhaps into the second quarter of the year and then starting to come down from there. I think those people would also want the government to keep making sure that we do spend on health and education and we do do the right things by making sure the public services are available for them, but it is a careful balance. Any spending that the government does, we have to take into account. So tax cuts are effectively potentially inflationary as well, especially if they're very untargeted. So this is the challenge we've got. It's the particular part of the economic cycle that we're in. New Zealand's done well. We're well positioned. We've got low unemployment. We've had good growth. This is a difficult period, but we will come through the other side of it. I just want to touch on the Prime Minister's trip to Asia at the moment, visiting Singapore and Japan. China, of course, is our largest trading partner. Are our relations with China strained? Our relations with China are good, and obviously New Zealand continues to export a lot of goods into China and has done right through the pandemic. China is taking a different approach to COVID than most other countries at the moment and so therefore isn't taking the kinds of delegations that the Prime Minister is currently leading in Japan and Singapore. From time to time we're going to have areas where we do disagree with China and we've talked about that openly. We've raised those issues with them but that doesn't mean that the relationship overall is in trouble or anything like that. But in terms of visits they're just not having the kinds of't mean that the relationship overall is in trouble or anything like that but in terms of visits they're just not having the kinds of delegations that the PMs are leading to Japan and Singapore where we've got business people and so do those issues impact our desire to our dependence on China and our reliance on them for trade or are we trying to move ourselves offshore to Singapore and Japan, our fourth and fifth largest trading partners? I think diversification in both where we sell our products to and the kinds of products we sell is absolutely essential. I think that's one of the things that COVID has taught us that you can't afford as a country to have all your eggs in one basket. So China will remain important. But equally, we've got to be pushing those markets where we already have a foot old like Singapore and Japan, but also the United States and up into Europe, South America. These are all places where New Zealand has the potential to be able to sell our goods and services into. And so, yep, we're definitely looking for a diversification strategy. It's an important part of our overall economic plan. Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson, thanks very much for your time this morning. Goodness me, 11 minutes away from 8 o'clock, you can, you know, about the cruise lines at the start of your interview. You can understand why businesses are getting really, really irked with the government because it just comes across like they don't really understand business, you know, to say, well, we can wait till the summer until, you know, we can wait for a while until we tell these cruise lines whether they come or not. You know, the summer, the season isn't until the summer. Well, people actually book well in advance, and businesses rely on certainty and dates that don't change. And the fact that they haven't given them one yet, and there's the biggest conference of the year for the cruise ship industry about to start in Miami and they've got no idea when we're going to open is just laughable. This is where we can go and make an announcement to the world about our borders are open too. Come on over. But no, we'll have to tell you in a few weeks ago. It's the same thing. When you go to the cafes over the Easter weekend and there's not enough staff and everything, it's because the borders aren't open. We can't get staff yet. We didn't think that far ahead. We just... Late footed once again. It is. And the Prime Minister's over in Singapore and Japan right now, selling us to the world as a tourist destination. Talk about, you know, the cart before the horse.

You're listening to Ring of Fire, an absolute classic by Johnny Cash, which was released 59 years ago today. Let's take a look back at other events on the 19th of April with this day in history. On this day in 1967, Dave McKenzie became the first Kiwi to win the Boston Marathon. He finished in 2015 minutes a record at the time. In 1971, the Soviet Union placed into orbit Saluet the world's first space station. It ended in tragedy 24 days later, plummeting back to Earth, killing all three crew. On this day in 1927, actress May West was found guilty of obscenity and corrupting the morals of youth in a New York stage play entitled sex. And on this day in 1987, The Simpsons appeared on American screens for the very first time. But it would take another two years for half an hour episodes, as we now know them, to begin. That was the day in history for the 19th of April. Now, it is 100 days until the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the UK, and our athletes are limbering up in the hope of bringing home plenty of medals. William is with him this morning. William, good morning. We're excited. Morena, I'm excited as well, Ryan, and I'm with the amazing Hayden Wilde bronzeist from Tokyo and just all-round good guy. Mate, how are you? How's it? How's the excitement levels? 100 days to go. Moral, it's quite good, to be honest. A long-time follower view and it's a pleasure to be interviewed. But now we're here at the Uncomworth Games to get amongst some action and have a bit of fun. How's the training going, bro? I know you've still got three hundred days are still like, let's be honest, it's still a long time. But how's the training, like, progression? Yeah, it's going quite well. Had a couple months off after I got back after MIQ. We actually just finished a three-week race block, which is really awesome to have in New Zealand. And, yeah, we're the fitness is at the moment. It's really nice. A hundred days out. Hope I can squeeze a little bit more out and get a bit of a his ass horse oh that I'll be I'll be waiting for that and I'll be holding you to that but mate what's your favourite leg of the triathlon like what do you like the best yeah I think my my go-to is the run that's where I kind of make my move normally it takes a while for me to get out of the water like the others and ride pretty well and yeah, the run's probably my favourite. If you know looking off other things as well you can kind of do everything with running so it's a perfect spot. Yeah beauty mate and the Maltese falcons someone said that that's your nickname was that self-proclaimed or did someone give you that? Someone gave me that it's pretty much a nutshell I nutshell. I got it from Malta, and I can't really swim. So I'm always coming from the back, and attack my enemies from the back on the bike, and then get them on the run as the, there's a war hero who used to look after the Maltese island. He used to attack his prey from the behind, and that's what I do, is out of the water behind, come up and hiss them at the back. All right, mate. All right, we're about to do it. I'm taking the warm up. We're going to get the Malt up and hiss them at the back. All right, mate. All right, we're about to do what I'm taking the warm up. We're going to get the Maltese Falcon to rejoin the group. Mate, I'm going to warm you guys. All right, team, how's everyone going? Can't hear you. All right, we're going to start. We're just warming those hips up. Just get through, get through, and if you want, push yourself into it. Push yourself into it. Warm it up. Yeah, open the hips up. How does that feel? Let me know. How does that feel? Yeah, good. All right. All right. Now we get our shoulder width apart. Let's get those feet. Let's try and spread. Let's get a nice wide spread. And just lengthen that groin. It's real crucial. It's crucial. It's really lengthen that groin. I can't hear you. Is it good? Can you guys feel that? Yeah, good. All right. Now, running on the spot, high knees. Be careful not to knee yourself in the chin. And that's it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. There you have it. Warned up the guys. They are all good to go. Right. Back to you guys. Probably safe to say they haven't had a warm-up quite like that before our common world games, the athletes. But you know, William, it's news first time for everything. Yeah, there is indeed. He's brought his mates. This is the actual... Can you get Shush your mates, Des and Troy? Des and Troy, give us your guns. Sorry. Give us a bicep curl. Give us your guns out there. Des and Troy. Des and Troy. Give us your guns. Give us a bicep curl. Give us your guns out there. Des and Troy. No, no, no. No one needs this. Bernie, you. No one wants to see that. No one wants to see that. Well, there are actually three votes in here that say yes. Hey, William, that is actually our Commonwealth Games, well, some of our Commonwealth Games team, isn't it? And you have just given them their first group warm-up. So that's very, very exciting. And 100 days to go. Yeah. Which is still a long time. 100 days is a long time, guys. So I said, like Hayden was excited, but not fully, you know, like two weeks or a week away, something you want to, you know. That's more like, yeah, let's go, but 100 days is still a lot of training and hard work to go. Yeah. Now, William, I just noticed behind you, there's some movement again. And what I'm actually worried about is that our competitors over at breakfast might be having their own little warm up. And of course we were first, of course. But I just wonder if it's worth you running, just quietly, just run into the back of that shot and see if you can join in. Come on. Oh my gosh. Come on. Just give them a little warm up from the back. Mate, you make me do these things all the time and what I'm going to say is, yes, I will do it. Yes. He normally never do it. Yes. He normally never does it. He's striding as well. He's walking with confidence. Get that groin in there. Oh, I guess. Oh, gosh. Oh, no. I thought he'd slotted at the back. Good boy. It's a lot. Cheers, guys. Good plan. William's all right. Cheers guys. William. William enjoys some Commonwealth. It actually looks like crowd goes wild actually. It looks like storm purpose. Oh William, thanks very much. Eight minutes. One minute past eight and it is time for news now. Yes it is. Good morning to you. It is one minute past now. Yes, it is. Good morning to you. It is one minute past eight. The New Zealand Cruise Association CEO says he'll be embarrassed to turn up to a major international cruise conference without a date of the maritime border reopening. The Prime Minister stated in March that the government would begin work on our ports being reopened to cruise ships, but nothing has been announced. Kevin O'Sullivan told AM he hopes to get the date soon, so he doesn't have to be embarrassed. So for New Zealand, namely me, will be standing up, I hope not to, but standing up with a great deal of embarrassment in saying, look, we're not open yet and we don't know when. So I really need government to make an announcement. Do it now, Do it today. Stop next to ground. Kevin O'Sullivan is leaving for Miami on Thursday for the International Cruise Conference next week. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says the government expects to make an announcement on when the maritime border will reopen in the next few weeks. He confirmed to AM there awaiting advice from health officials before making a decision. We've all aware of the impact that those cruise ships had in the early stages of the pandemic. They were places where COVID-19 spread quickly and caused us some issues even at the beginning, if you recall. So we will step through this carefully. We've always made sure we put New Zealand as health and safety as our first and most paramount thing. The Easter road toll has ended at four after confirmation of a fatal crash in Dunedin overnight. Emergency services attended to a rolled car near Lookart Point on State Highway 1 shortly after 9 on Monday evening. CPR was given to the sole driver of the vehicle, however. The person was confirmed deceased by police this morning. A scene examination has been completed and the motorway is now open. The United States is warning Russia's invasion of Ukraine is far from over. Russian missile strikes have killed civilians in the western city of Lovu and the eastern city of Harkiv. At the same time, forces are closing in on the western city of Lovu and the eastern city of Harkiv. At the same time, forces are closing in on the port city of Maripal where nearly 100,000 civilians are believed to be trapped. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby says all the while U.S. intelligence has seen Russian military supplies pouring into war zones. That's artillery, rotary aviation helicopters support, command and control enablers, and we do believe that they have reinforced the number of battalion tactical groups in the east and the south of Ukraine. Kirby says a lack of access to water who's seen civilians in Murray-Upole make desperate attempts to flee the city. Sports News, New Zealand squash star Joelle King has ended her title draft by winning the Manchester Open. King pared her way, past the top seat, Sarah Jane Perry, and straight games to win her first title since 2019. It was an emotional victory for the 33-year-old who's faced plenty of challenges to get to this point. I've been through a lot of downs. who's faced plenty of challenges to get to this point. I've been through a lot of downs. So to be at this point, winning a tournament against the caliber of players that we have on tour, I mean so much. Suspensions have come thick and fast for Kiwi Super Rugby teams with Scott Barrett, Asafo Omoa and Josh Dixon, facing lengthy bans. Barrett has been suspended for four weeks after pleading guilty to a high tackle on blues prop Alex Hodgman in the Crusader's 27 to 23 defeat of the Blues. The judiciary reduced its ban from six to four weeks, meaning he'll be back in time for their home game against Fiji and Druah in late May. Dixon and Amour have both copped three-week suspensions following separate incidents in the Hurricanes 21 to 21 over the Highlanders on Saturday. That's the very latest from News Hub, 5 past 8. Thank you very much, Bernardine. We are going to check on your weather. William hopefully has cooled himself down but how's the rest of the country looking? William is with us in Auckland this morning. He's been hanging with the Commonwealth Games team 100 days out from kickoff from the starting line of the Commonwealth Games this year in Birmingham. Good morning, William. Morena, Ryan, and morena to you at home. Yes, I've found this sport more suited to me, which is bowls. They're really ripping into it with some really dynamic sports, but I think with my old bod, I need to stick to something a bit more suited to me, but let's bowl our way around New Zealand, Oteuro for the weather.

It will be a great game in Birmingham. Can't wait. William, thanks very much. I'm putting a lot of energy, energy into my weather reads. So it's really sweating from reading weather. I'd be no good at the Com games. It was that warm up earlier. Got you all hot and bothered. Never throw a Kiwi. William, never throw a Kiwi. She's just down here. Pick it up.

Taking 16 minutes at the moment from the airport into the city and 51 minutes from Waikinae of course on the new transmission gully. Traffic updates thanks to our partner. Battery Zone, your local battery experts. The Invictus Games have got underway in the Netherlands. The international sporting event brings together teams of injured soldiers to compete in a range of sports. And from athletics to wheelchair rugby, and although New Zealand isn't competing this year, it has a special eye on a future event. Here to tell us more is Empire, Empire, PR, and events director, Kathy Cunningham. Kathy, thank you so much for joining us live from The Hague this morning. Now, it is your idea to bring the Enfixus Games down to New Zealand. Why? Well, when we look at everything that the military and the veterans have done to fight for our freedom, this is just one little way that we can say thank you. Also, what I've learned when I was in Sydney in 2018 and now in the Hague is that the family and friends part of the competition is significant as well. We can see that the power of sport can change lives, but it will also capture our hearts and really challenge our minds because people see when someone has an amputated limb, but it's the invisible wounds that are really just as significant. So there's so many things that we can learn, and I really have to say that everyone has been so gracious and grateful. And when you're in that environment, it really is something significant. And it's been bent all the way around the world, isn't it? So it's important for host cities because of the exposure they get. And this is, I guess, led by the fact that Prince Harry founded the event. Now, New Zealand bid for it in 2025, but the stadium wasn't going to be ready. Are we actually equipped to be able to host it in 2027? I absolutely think that we will be, especially in Christchurch. The Metro Sports Arena will open this year. One of the, I think, really important aspects of Ototahi as well is Naitahu, having such a strong Maudi battalion in their history can tell their stories through the Invictus games. Access is also a really important issue. Ototahi is flat. We'll have the ability to walk from hotel to sports venue to entertainment precinct and really do something special with an authentic welcome. How much will it cost? Because a couple of years ago, it was looking at around a $25 million investment. Has that been revised up since then? And how much would the government have to contribute? Well, we've asked the government for between $ and 10 million, so yes, it will be around $25 million. Christchurchin Zed spent a little bit of money on creating a feasibility study that really looked at the return on investment, not just for Christchurch, but for the whole country. And Melissa, you said that. It's international recognition, nationwide pride, but also the ability to showcase some of the companies creating prosthetics and wheelchairs in Christchurch and other companies as well. But I just want to go back to the resilience of the Christchurch residents and how that story is going to resonate with all the competitors and their family and friends. Have you heard from Prince Harry or have you had any conversations with him about his desire for it to be in New Zealand? I have. I actually met Prince Harry on Friday morning and we attended a really small function about 100 people called the conversation that was focused on friends and family. Andrew Parsons, the president of the Paralympics, was there, and he's learning every day that the friends and family are important, but going back to Prince Harry. He and also so many others love the Kiwis. And he was really disappointed that New Zealand's not here, but understands why. At the opening ceremony, the New Zealand flag was out first alongside the Ukrainian flag, which just made my heart jump to have New Zealand and Ukraine flag standing side by side. The Ukrainian team is here too and the support for them has just been heart-stombing. Absolutely. Empire, PR and events director, Kathy, thanks for joining us live from The Hague and do keep us posted on that bid for hosting Invictus 2027. Thank you. And yeah, unfortunately New Zealand weren't able to send a team to the Hague this year. Some of those athletes were a bit disappointed in that. The NZDF sent a statement saying they had to make this call last year and due to the continued uncertainty around COVID-19 and the borders, they had to make that decision there. So they're focusing on 2023. And yet we could send 200 people to the World Expo in Dubai, didn't we, to put on a show for no one turning up? I mean, they're just some of the decisions, again, just really mind-boggling. But as you say, it would be great to have it here in Little Old New Zealand, wouldn't it? The Invictus Games. Actually, I meant to ask you, is the Queen okay? Because Harry stopped off there, didn't he? Yes, he did on the way to the Hague. Well, it's interesting, I'm hearing that the Queen's default now is going to be not to go to events and that you will hear on the day if she is. So that is a change from expecting the Queen to be at these events and then hearing when she's not. But it's mostly around mobility issues. Okay, all right. I mean, she's 95. She's doing incredibly well. So we can forgive her for not automatically being on the invite list for every event. 18 minutes after 8 now. Coming up, our panel is here on the couch.

Changing Rooms UK, Monday 830 on Eden. Welcome back, everyone. Welcome back, everyone. It is 22 minutes after 8, and it is time for our panel now, our panel of the day. News Hub National correspondent Patty Gow is here. Good morning, Patty. Morning. Also, we're very excited to have Velocity Global CEO, Carmen Viclitch here as well. Good morning. Good morning. Great to see you both. Now, we've been talking to the cruise industry this morning. And this poor guy from the cruise industry is off for this big conference, and everyone's going to be boasting about their countries and the cruise. He's got no idea when our maritime border is opening. And the government this morning says they's got no idea when our maritime border is opening. And the government this morning says they still have no idea when the maritime border is opening. Carmen, as a business, how hard is it to deal with that uncertainty? It's really, really a struggle. You have to have a plan. Even if you have to change that plan, how do you actually run or make decisions based on no plan? So I think that's really frustrating. Because even if you say, well, based on this, we're to expect this and then you have to change it. We all know this is unexpected. We had Delta. We had Omnicon. Unexpected is going to happen, but you have to have a plan. So incredibly frustrating. Yeah, and I'll tell you what, coming past the bottom of Queen Street today, in some ways it's probably good that we're not open because, you know, what would the American tourists be getting out to at the moment? It's sort of the hellhole of the South Pacific down there. You wouldn't want to be walking out there coming from Florida with a nice little bum bag full of cash heading up there at the minute. I'm quite serious. It's not good. I'm actually living down there at the moment and I don't, and my partner, we don't walk at night. As soon as it gets dark, we stop walking in Auckland City. Yeah, yeah. As to opening up, I was down in Queensland over the weekend, and I can tell you, things were starting to hum. And I saw a guy from Wanaka who's running a restaurant down there, and I said to him, mate, you must be absolutely bloody stoked at the people that are out and about down here. And the first thing he said to me, yeah, but Paddy, we've got no staff. Yeah, we've got no staff. We've got no staff. But I'm happy to break the story that I think I saw the start of New Zealand's tourism boom down there visually, and I do like breaking stuff, which was it was like a plant germing in the corner, you know, when they break out, and it was in Queenstead Airport last night, and I looked over to the corner, and there was one guy looking at a TV, and he was watching Aussie rules. And I said said to myself that is the start of the tourism boom and Aussie, there's someone watching Aussie rules in Queensland again. Yeah well we need more of them don't we? But it's not only businesses that are hurting because they've got to find staff and they're waiting for tourists to come back in but homeowners, so many people come in are going to have to refix their mortgages this year and they're going to find that they might be facing another thousand dollars on their bill a week. Yeah, that's right. Around 65,000 investors are going to change their interest rates and around 60,000 homeowners and obviously cost of living going up really rapidly. So it is going to be an interesting year for those. Yeah, it's just made me sort of sweat a little. Actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah, with nerves. But it's going to be an interesting year for those. Yeah, it's just made me sort of sweat a little, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah, with nerves. But it's going to be interesting for the whole country because, look, let's face it, people with mortgages and property, in my opinion, have been pretty smug since about the year 2000 in this country and they've really had things quite easy. Now we're seeing the whole thing ripped up, torn up, and we're going to see a lot of pain out there, and it's really going to change things for Kiwis. I don't think they've been smug. I don't think you can say they've been smug at all. I haven't been ripped up, torn up, and we're going to see a lot of pain out there, and it's really going to change things for Kiwis. I don't think they've been smug. I don't think you can say they've been smug at all. No. No, I mean, and the thing is that there are those people who say, well, if you own a house, you're an evil person, you know, you're evil incarnate, you're most the devil. But really, what you're paying is a huge amount in interest over the lifetime of your mortgage, plus obviously paying back the money that you borrowed to get it. And should you be vilified for just having a house? And Kiwis have always been in love with the picker fence and owning a home. It's our Kiwi way. And so I think, you know, actually we are one of the most stable property markets in the world, even in 2008. People did not lose value on their properties. But obviously, anything that goes up needs to settle. It's just a cycle. So I think we're just going to see a little bit of a settle for a period. People wear a little less smug. Doing it up with this Green Party line. I mean, just give it up, Patty. A lot of difference between smug and evil, but yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, you start with smug and you end up, you know. It's a slippery slope. It is a slippery slope. Hey, very quickly, travel and being in the car and being on the plane and whatever. We've done a lot of it over the long weekend. What is some travel etiquette that you advice that you would give to people? I can give you one to start it off on the ferry over to Waikiki Island on the weekend. I thought I'll avoid the traffic. But the ferry was full, of course. That's fine. Good to see people out. They're not smug. They're not smug. Yeah, Mr. Non-smug, I just saw the ferry to weigh for the weekend. Well, I wasn't on a private boat. Anyway, and there's very few seats, obviously. It's a full ferry. And still, people are sitting with the middle seat, the space between them. And so there's these poor people walking down the boat, and they can't sit down because people are sitting with the middle seat, the space between them and so there's these poor people walking down the boat and they can't sit down because people are guarding these seats in between them. So my little travel etiquette is always take the middle seat if the boat is full. Move along. Carmen, you got one? Yes, actually I've been back and forth to Trans Tasman since it opened and the people next to you on the plane that wear their mask around their neck and then keep blowing their nose like just cover your nose I thought I don't want to be a Karen I'm not going to ask and I'm like please could you cover your nose I think the lady's going to tell you off especially when you're constantly blowing your nose so if it's still nervous you know when people sneeze on a plane or cough and this person was blowing their nose but they're constantly hit as a neck warmer so it would be lovely if you could put it over your nerves if you definitely are ill. Yeah, I mean, I'm the sort of guy. I just want to apologise to anyone out there who I've offended with my lack of travel etiquette over Easter, including when I tried to go into the parallel park, ended up doing an angle park in the rental car, and the hubcap ejected and nearly wiped out a little old lady. So whoever she is, I'm super sorry, a little old lady that I nearly hit with the hubcap ejected and nearly wiped out a little old lady. So whoever she is, I'm super sorry. A little old lady, they nearly hit with the hubcap. What you mean, whoever she is? You didn't stop? Because she was okay? Let me guess. And your owner. I have things to do. And you own a home. You're that kind of person. I had to get on my private boat to Wahiki. Did you end up parallel parking, or did you keep it on the angle? I was sort of about midpoint. I'd like to call it a sort of on the hypotenuse. I think I was, a high potter news park. Well, that's even worse. Brilliant. Hey, thank you guys. That was fun. Thanks for coming on the show. Thank you for having us. Sorry if I've been so smugged. 29 minutes after 8 o'clock now. That's News Hub national correspondent Patty Gower and Velocity Global CEO Carmen Visselich with us this morning. It's time now for the news. Morena, good morning. It's 830. The cruise industry says they'll be embarrassed if they turn up to a major international conference without a firm date for when ships can return to New Zealand ports. The recent loosening of COVID-19 restrictions means cruise companies are hoping boats can return to our waters next summer. But despite the Prime Minister saying that discussions were ongoing, no decision has been made. NZ Cruise Association Chief Executive Kevin O'Sullivan's off to Miami next week to talk with operators and hopes a return date is set before he gets there. So poor New Zealand, namely me, will be standing up, I hope not to, but standing up with a great deal of embarrassment in saying look, we're not open yet and we don't know when. So I really need government to make an announcement. Do it now, do it today. You know, stop them. Stop next to ground. Cruise ships were welcomed back into Australia for the first time on Monday. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says the government expects to make an announcement on when the Maritime Board will reopen in the next few weeks. He confirmed to AM there awaiting advice from health officials before making a decision. We've all aware of the impact that those cruise ships had in the early stages of the pandemic. They were places where COVID-19 spread quickly and caused us some issues even at the beginning, if you recall. So we will step through this carefully. We've always made sure we put New Zealand as health and safety as our first and most paramount thing. The Easter road toll has ended at four after confirmation of a fatal crash in Dunedin overnight. Emergency services attended to a rolled car near Lookart Point on State Highway 1 shortly after 9 on Monday evening. CPR was given to the sole driver of the vehicle. However, the person was confirmed deceased by police this morning. A scene examination has been completed and the motorway is now open. The search for a fisherman missing off the east coast near Portaqui will resume this morning. The man was reported missing after failing to return home on Sunday afternoon from a fishing trip at Toreri in the Bay of Plenty. The search area stretches from Toreri north to Makatu. Police are asking people to keep an eye out for items such as 100-liter chili bin, wooden oars and a yellow life jacket. Coast guard, surf lifesaving and rescue helicopters are expected to join the search today. The Pope has been told by Ukrainian Marines at Maripol is what hell on earth looks like. Russian reinforcements have joined the battle for the port city, trapping 100,000 civilians in the line of fire. Despite the bombardment, Ukrainian troops are holding on, with officials warning if they fall, few troops will make it out alive. Ukrainian Defence Ministry spokesman Alexander Maktukyong says while it's tough, it's keeping Russian forces occupied. Mariupol has attracted a very large enemy force and in fact the way the defenders of this city are holding on it prevents Russia from relocating these units to other directions but it comes at a cost. Thousands are dead. Meanwhile, Russian missiles have killed civilians in both the western city of Love You and the eastern city of Aarkev and an act officials are calling barbaric. In sport, the countdown is on to the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, which are just 100 days away. Tokyo bronze medalist triathlete Hayden Wilde told AM he's in top shape ahead of his first appearance at the Games in Birmingham. We actually just finished a three-week race block, which is really awesome to have in New Zealand. And, yeah, with the fitness is at the moment, it's really nice. A hundred days out, hope that can squeeze a little bit more out. Manchester United Star, Cristiano Ronaldo, and his partner Georgina Rodriguez, have announced that their baby boy has passed away. The couple were expecting twins, but only one survived, saying it's the greatest pain that any parents can feel. Ronaldo said the birth of his baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. The Warriors will seek formal clarification on a number of incidents from Sunday's defeat to the Sydney Roosters. News Hub understands the club is unhappy and will ask for a please explain from the NRL's referees boss, Graham Annesley. It comes after Warriors Centre, Jesse Arthur's was controversially denied a try, and Roosters captain James Tedesco avoided a sinbin in the first half. Two calls that coach Nathan Brown thinks should have gone the other way. Finally at 8.30, 80 critically endangered spotted tree frogs are now settling into their new home in Australia's Cozy Ozocco National Park. Scientists are desperate to save the species after the deadly 2020 wildfires nearly wiped them out. It's the first release of the frogs following a successful two-year breeding program. Each frog will be closely monitored with high hopes they can keep track of their every move. That's the relay latest from NewsHub. It is 26 minutes to nine. Thanks very much, Bernardine. Some disagreement here over cruises and whether they should be welcomed back into New Zealand. Fiona says, I've always been a Labour voter after listening to Grant Robertson this morning with his dismissive attitude towards making a decision and whether they should be welcomed back into New Zealand. Fiona says, I've always been a Labour voter after listening to Grant Robertson this morning with his dismissive attitude towards making a decision as to when we can start cruising again. I'm over them. I don't even go on cruises, but it's the disregard for people working in these industries that drives me crazy. Hugh, though, says cruise ships are incubators for communicable diseases, and some of us are not confident that cruise lines will not yet again cover up breakouts of disease on their ships. I mean we've got to move on from that mindset don't we? For goodness sakes we have got to move on from that. We can test people much more than we could back when cruise ships were an issue. People are sort of living in fear still. You get an legionese disease on a cruise. You can get all sorts of things on a cruise. You're right, You just can't just grind to a halt. Well, they always had, what's the, is it, norovirus? That's the one you get in hospitals, but they always had breakouts of that on cruise ships, didn't they? You had the odd bit of the old bad curry as well. Yeah, and that's why whenever you got, even before COVID, you'd get in on a cruise ship. I went on one once. And there's hand sanitizer everywhere throughout the cruise, and you think, what's that for? And then it's, And then it's the norovirus that you'll probably get. But you can get that anywhere when you're travelling, can't you? Let's hear to William now, who has been working up a bit of a sweat with our Com Games athletes this morning. How's it going, guys? Morninah! Hope you guys are going well there. Just thought I'd shot that one through. On that, let's shot ourselves around the motu for the weather.

We're catching up with the sensational stellar Ebert Stella. You're going to show me a few bits? Yeah. Oh, wow. Beautiful. Oh, I think I've got this one, Stella. Tell me what you got. Beautiful, William. I'm sorry, I think I've ruined your ribbon, and I'm very sorry for that. William, can you ask, tell her what she'd give you out of? I'm sorry, I think I've ruined your ribbon and I'm very sorry for that. You're great. William, can you ask Stella what should give you out of 10? William, can you ask Stella what should give you out of 10? Stella, what would you give me out of 10 for that effort? I will say it was a great effort. I'm going to give you a nine. Oh! I actually might start pursuing that now that you're giving me a nine from a professional like yourself. Thank you very much. Thank you William. I'm not out of breath though. It is rhythmic gymnastics champion. Stella Ebert with us this morning of course part of the team going to the Commonwealth Games in 100 days time from now. Very cool. Now it is time for a treat and to win things Easter may be over, but we're still not chocolateed out, which is a great thing because AM has teamed up with Cadbury to announce a new treat.

The chocolate's not in stores until this Sunday but we've got some Boisbury Ripple ice creams here to warm up our pellets this morning so we're going to give it a little taste. Look at that, that's a perfect swirl, isn't it? See, I think about all the flavors, you know, the old... See, I'm going to go over that one because it's bigger. Can you pass me my bowl? It's just... What, you're inflexible? You didn't warm up with your ribbon this morning. There's certain things I have to... The boots, you see, because it's party of five plus a day. Oh. Yeah, I'm not sure if it counts, but it doesn't really matter because it tastes good. It kind of reminds me on my childhood, I think. Fresh. Good. Fresh on the palate. Very good. Very good.

It's called it to 9-0. Our next guest chance encounter with Adain in her home city of Wellington led her to fly to Denmark with no idea of when she'd be home. The experience through Kerry Bloomfield into a very different world and inspired her to write a book about it called Nothing Like Adain. And Kerry joins us now. Kerry, welcome back to New Zealand, first of all. It has been three years. Have you noticed anything different? People talk about reverse culture shock. Yeah, I'm still unpacking a lot of that. I've only been back a week at the moment. So I'm still working my way through that. I feel in some ways the conversations here are a couple of, a little bit older than what we have in Denmark at the moment around the pandemic. So that's a bit of an adjustment as well. Of course. Now, I want to start with the book and where you start in the book, which is to talk about a very, should we say stark difference between New Zealanders and Europeans. Tell us about that, one of your first impressions. So nudity in Denmark is very acceptable. That's not to say people are walking down the street and naked all the time. But the swimming pool culture is quite different than what it is here. And one of my first experiences was being dropped off at the swimming pool by my Danish partner and him yelling at me to make sure that I had a shower before I jumped in the swimming pool, which I thought was a bit unnecessary for him to give me such strict instructions. But as I went through the process, I realised that once you step into the changing room in a Danish swimming pool, everybody is naked, blowing drying their hair, talking to each other like they're at the supermarket. And I think our attitudes to nudity in New Zealand are quite different. And I'm used to hiding behind a big towel when I'm in the swimming pool, hiding everything that I can. Absolutely. It is one of many hilarious anecdotes you have in the book about dealing with those cultural differences for New Zealanders who are looking to go overseas. We know there's a lot of them at the moment. What would be your advice for getting to grips with a new culture? Yeah, I think the big thing is that when we live in our own country, we all think we're normal. We all think the way that we're doing things is the right way. And it's not until we move overseas and start to see how other people are living and learning from different ways of doing things that we realise that maybe we're not so normal after all. Maybe we don't know best. So my experience or advice would be for people to go with that open mind. Try and keep a hold of who you are in the inside. I think that can be quite disorientating when you move countries. Definitely. But to keep an open mind. Author Kerry Bloomfield, Kerry, I'm sorry we have to leave it there, but we will have more on your book, Nothing Like Adain, on our website.

All right. Time to talk fashion. Time to talk about winter coats with winter just around the corner. We've got our stylist, in-house stylist. Sarah Stewart will hear us with us this morning. Good morning. So should we invest in a new winter coat? I think if I could, I'd have a coat for every single day of the week and every occasion. But realistically, I think you just need two. One that's slightly shorter and then one that's longer. This is for men and women? Yes, yeah. Okay, and what about the fabrics? Because I can see there's quite a few different types of fabrics behind you. What do you recommend? Well, there's a lot that's trending at the moment. Puffer jackets, there's also quilted ones. But, of course, a good traditional wool jacket, I think, is best breathable and also warm. Do you have to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on jackets to get a good one? You most definitely can, but if you don't want to, there's lots of inexpensive jackets that are available at the moment. If you do buy a slightly more expensive jackets, there's more of a you know, there's more quality, guarantee and also longevity. But there's lots of great jackets out at the moment. There's ones at Ruby, Forever New, Barkers, also there's lots of great jackets out at the moment. There's ones at Ruby, Forever New, Barkers, also there's COS and Kamala and Mark we've got here in Cooper. What about the polyester wool blend thing? Is that something we should avoid at all costs? Not necessarily. So synthetic and natural have, both have pros and cons. Polyester being synthetic is durable and also easy to look after, but not as breathable and warm, whereas wool is a natural fibre, so then it will be, although higher maintenance and probably a little bit more expensive, it's definitely more warm and most definitely breathable. Brilliant. Well, some great advice from you this morning, as always, Sarah. As people head into the winter season, thank you very much to joining us. You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
