Yeah, she didn't remember you. So I pretended to be the delivery guy and I got out of that. She gave me a good tip though. Okay. How's Rania settling in? She's great. Although she'd rather be teaching than serving coffee. Amira loves that she's here. I guess I'm a better father than I am a mother. Who said you were any good at either? Tell me again, Khaled. You tried for asylum two years ago. Why does your new lawyer think it would be any different today? He does this for people whose first claim was denied. He says even though I've been living here without papers, he can make the case. It's not safe for me in Libya. There's too much fighting and violence. And he knows this official in the office in Ottawa? He's confident? That's why my interview is there. What about you, Bashir? Do you love having Rania here too? I do? Of course I do. Do you don't tell you on the spot if your appeal is successful? No, but Mr. Klein says I can work legally whilst being processed. And if it isn't successful?

You make it sound like I was stabbed. Not so exciting as that, Dr. Ahmed. Hamid. I turned into an exposed nail. How long ago did that happen? I only asked because it looks infected. Three days ago? I dressed it myself, but I guess not very well. When did you last get the Tetanishat? When I came from India four years ago. Where are you from, Dr. Hamid? Syria, two and a half years ago. And you're already a doctor? Good for you. Back home, I was already a doctor. Here, I'm still a resident. Still, so fast. Right place at the right time, I suppose. I'm fortunate. Someone gave me an opportunity. What do you do for work, sir? I'm trained as an electrical engineer. Will you need to stitch? Well, because of the infection, I think we should leave it open. Should order some blood work just in case and get you started on antibiotics. My company needs a form saying I'm fine to go back to work. You'll sign it? Let's wait and see what your labs say. You break that, you buy it. Jay Cooper? I'm Dr. Hunter. Wow, you're young. I mean, this is my first hospital rotation, and I wasn't planning on making a terrible first impression. Don't sweat it. How's a third-year med school treating you? Good, good, yeah. I'm glad to be getting a brain from exams, though. Hmm. So why pediatrics? Wasn't my first choice. My first choice was full, but I figured I should probably just keep my options open. Well, and I'll save you the sales pitch. Except to say that like any calling, it chooses you. No missed appointments no no no fluctuations in your rhythm if this holds we can push your pacemaker another year maybe two that's great one more thing any interest in a part-time resident practice really emerge would come first i could use a resident with your experience in cardiology i've never Any interest in a part-time resident practice? Really? Emerge would come first. I could use a resident with your experience in cardiology. I know your own cardiac history isn't something you spend a lot of time dwelling on, but these experiences are formative. And who better than someone who knows what it's like to be a cardiac? I don't think so. I mean, thank you. That's a great offer. I just... I don't think it's the right time to take on more's a great offer. I just, um... I don't think it's the right time to take on more. You're busy. I figured. No problem. You've been a mechanic for 20 years, Frank. First time you've come to me for medical help. Oh, pain, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm fixing myself type of guy, Jed. It's whatever this is gonna to mean more problems for me. You mean like coming in with an oil leak and needing an engine rebuild? No, it's just a dislocated shoulder. You're punning me on? Yeah, we apprentice, same as you. Claire starts on your role soon and needs a... Gitty pig. Trust me, just lie back already, huh? Yeah, feet up, that's it. There you go, slow, so. It's like a handshake, huh? And then slowly work it out to 90 degrees. Yeah. Resistance? Ah, that should be. Frank? Frank, are you with us? Frank? This pulse is strong. Yeah, you just gotta, um, just gotta hyper-extend it. There we go. Okay. It's all right, Frank. Just breathe. Okay, well, I'm getting an irregular heartbeat, and so for a man your age, we're going to want to rule out anything like cardiac arrhythmia, hypoglycemia, or blood pressure issues. I said it was just a shoulder, Jed. Loss of consciousness changes that. We'll keep you a little longer, run some tests. Dolls the Curtis. Was it necessary to steam real clear like that? I just wasn't sure if she needed help and I thought I wasn't sure if you were... Then let me set the record straight. I am not hands-on. But if I need anyone stepping if she needed help, and I thought I wasn't sure if you were... Then let me set the record straight. I am not hands-on. But if I need anyone stepping in on a patient, I am overseeing, I will ask. Any questions? Which one have you is Dr. Hunter? That's me. You've been served. Guess that's one way to announce that I'm getting a divorce. Theo, I'm so sorry. In other news, uh, has everyone met Jake Cooper? Hey, Theo. Hey, Theo. Hey, Theo. I knew it was coming. Didn't think it would be in front of all my colleagues, but, uh, yeah, I still could see plenty of the girls. Even got myself in an apartment, a divorced dad's apartment in Sudbury. If you had to take dad. Sorry, just one second, okay? Hello? I got an urgent walking in here. What happened? These two got out the back of a car and they just... My name was fell through the glass doors of our building. We couldn't tell how bad it was until we got him in the car. I'm scared if I miss my hands, they'll pop out again. He's in size. Okay, let's go. I need help in here. Okay, Allison, we got you. Clear's going to take over after I killed to three. Standing by. Well, let's give our good Samara and a break, Dalton LeBlanc. On it. One, two, three. Okay, airways, Peyton, pulses, weak and rapid, prepare for MTP. Will you be okay? He has a chance, no, thanks to you. We'll update you as soon as we can. Heart raise 140. BP is 90 over 50. Scratch that, 80 over 60. Does it what you as soon as we can. Heart raise 140. BP is 90 over 50. Scratch that. 80 over 60. Do you see? Penetrating hepatic trauma patient rolled through a glass door, narrow pulse pressure, hypotensive tachycardic and hemodynamicly unstable. Oh, that is one explosive. Possible. You're going to have to retract to be sure. I've only done that once. I've never stopped you before. JNA retracts us for Dr. McBlanc. You need to find the bleed. You're going to gently suspend the organ to look underneath. Arnold, one gram TXA. Yeah. And putting pex cells through the level one now. Talk to me, nice. Um, blood's pulling underneath the liver. You asking me or telling me? I'm telling, I can't see where the blood's coming from. Arnold, so you can get more likely. I'll give the hands to You asking me or telling me? I'm telling. I can't see where the blood's coming from. Arnold, so you can get more light clear. Give a hint to you up here. Look, right in there. Hypatic artery is inferior on tear you into the right. Max? I've got the hypadoidina ligament. First of dropping, guys. Possible tear in the artery. I'm going to perform the peringal maneuver. Yep. You need to clump the porta hepatis. The same to clap. Let's get clapped. Let's get clapped. Got it. Good. Right. Cover the wind and soaked dresses. Get them up to your alarm now. I couldn't see where the lady was coming from. Must understand the role your confidence is rattled. I know you took a couple of days off, but if you need more time... No, I'm fine, sir. I just. I must understand where your confidence is ruffled. I know you took a couple of days off, but if you need more time. No, I'm fine, sir. I just want things to go back to normal. Our new family doctor thinks it's an allergy. He put us on a food challenge. But every time we, you know, we rule something out, the vomiting comes back. He threw a bile this morning. Well, that does not sound fun, but how about you open up? Let me take you up, okay? No offense to the hardworking doctors in the room, but our GP isn't doing enough. You know, we need real results from real tests as soon as you can get us in. Scope, MRI, blood work, someone to take this seriously. Any recurring fever or headaches? No. Why don't you lay back for me? What about stress? Because that can really do a number on your stomach. Oh, well, I just moved here from Winnipeg. First year of high school in a new city, but Dima here, he's kicking ass and taking names. Get straight A's, he always has. It's been a real trooper about all of this. We're going to get through this, pal. Chronic gastritis? That's rare in teenagers. Appendicitis. There's no localized abdominal pain. What'd you think about the dad? I mean, nice guy. It didn't exactly let his son get a word in. And exhaustion and gastrointestinal symptoms can all stem from anxiety. Well, if it's psychological, would Dimitri even know that? I may not be ready to say. Even well-meaning parents can have blind spots, especially when their life is in transition. These things can be delicate. I guess you'd know. As a doctor, not as a parent. I don't even know if you have kids. We'll check for an ulcer with a barium swallow. That'll have to wait until tomorrow. Hopefully, Dimitri will be ready to open up by then. In the meantime, you get to learn how to order GI tests. The glass sliced an artery under his liver, but we got to it in time because he kept him alive. I've lived down the hall for him for years, but I don't even know, Warren. Well, thank you so much for everything. Are you saying I should leave? I mean, it's just there's not much else you can do for him, so... I have his phone. I could let his family know what happened. Our social worker can do that unless you know them, maybe? It's just... I'm always at work first thing. Only today I was late. Trust me, I'm an accountant. I'm the last one to go down this road. But it's like the universe put me there at that exact moment. And now I've held his liver in my hands. I need to see this through. Did you have a major liver laceration in trauma? Apparently, the universe put me there just to fix it. You don't believe in fate? I mean, no, but the universe doesn't reward or punish us for who we are. Right, that was Dr. Novak's job, and thankfully he's gone now? No, it's not what I'm... I don't know. Hello again, Mr. Gupta. So your wound seems under control.

Back to Toronto, without you. I missed hearings after my first asylum claim was denied. There's a detention order against me. They may hold me. What? For how long? Mr. Klein doesn't think it will happen, and I said I would risk it. I give him your number just in case. Khaled, you're telling me this now? I didn't want you to try to I said I would risk it. I give him your number just in case. Khaled, you're telling me this now? I didn't want you to try to talk me out of doing it. Bashir, I don't work unless it's under the table. I am tired of living like a fugitive. Always looking over my shoulder like my life is on hold. I am not a real person. Thank you. Thank you. Tenth is 38.3.02 SATs 98. Mr. Gupta, tell me what happened. You know this, ma'am? I saw him yesterday for an infected puncture wound on his right thigh. No pulse. Legs ischemic. Was it cold and pale yesterday? No, but his wounds been slow to heal, utterance. Mr. Gupta, did something re-agravate your wound? Samir, I need to know what happened. It didn't even want the note. When I climbed the ladder, it started. 5 milligrams morphine. There is no fluid in his dorsan's penis artery. Dr. Atwater thrombosis? Arterial dissection. A pseudo-annurism can develop at the femoral artery after trauma. We need more imaging to confirm. Yeah, what is happening to me? There is a blockage and an artery in your leg, and the blood supply is being cut off. You need a procedure to resolve it, Samir, or you're going to lose this limb. Okay, put in an IV. I need two grams of ANSEF, one liter of NS, and let's get them to CT NGO to check out the blood vessel. Is there someone you'd like us to call for you, Mr. Gupta? Dr. Leblanc, any ear nurse said you'd be in today. Have you been here all night? His son is flying in, but he doesn't land for a while. Warren's opened his eyes a couple of times, but he just trips off right again. Totally normal after the trauma and surgery he went through. Isn't there someplace else you need to be? I don't want him to be alone when he does wake up. I feel like even the half stranger from down the hall is better than no one. Yeah, that's admirable, but also I heard a nurse say that his blood pressure is low, but I know that he takes meds for high blood pressure. How do you know that? Um, I found some pills in his pants. I left them for Dr. Weir, but he just had a nurse tell me that they have everything in hand. No one tells me anything because I'm not family, and you were so great yesterday, so I thought maybe if I told you about his blood pressure... Alison, um, you need to trust his team to handle it. You should go home. Get some rest. Morning, Mr. Bezina. So yesterday, they tell me my shoulder needs an operation, but I need to run a bunch of tests first, and now the nurses are saying it might not even happen today. Right, well, that's what I wanted to discuss. Bloodwork is showing that your kidney function is impaired. Okay, that's my own damn fault. I eat like crab, drink too much. I know. Actually, I was concerned about a condition called Aplastic Anemia. What does that have to do with my shoulder? Nothing, but it is a potentially serious condition that prevents your body from producing new blood cells. How concerned are we talking here? Enough to want to rule it out with a bone marrow biopsy. So a hematologist will be by soon and we can have a day. Hold on, hold on, hold on. You want to stick a needle into my bone because you have a hunch? It's not a hunch. You're a mechanic. Benzine and gasoline is one of the known causes. This is why I don't go to the doctor. You come in with one little thing and leave with a whole other set of problems. This is a potentially life-threatening condition we're talking about. Or it could be nothing. That's what I'm saying. Can you talk some sense here, Jed? Give us a minute, Dr. Curtis. Take this form to the third floor, and then take one turn left and then one right. Can I stay with them for the X-ray? How's it going, guys? In Mr. First, we were hoping that you could take me through all the foods that Tometri ruled out during his allergy test. While I walk him upstairs, make sure the techs know what to look for. It's cool, Dad. He can take me. Okay. I'll see you after. I'm looking for my husband. Samir Gupta. Someone called. That was me, Mrs. Gupta. I'm Dr. Bashir Hamad. Take this way. John? You called her, Dr. Hamid. I didn't want to worry her. He said it was an emergency. Of course I should be worried. Anju, I'm fine. There was an aneurysm in my leg, but they fixed it. Tell her. Yes, surgeons fill a small wire through Samir's artery to clear an obstruction caused by an exposed nail. He's recovering, but because the wound still infected, his temperature is elevated. A nail in your leg? And this happened at the office? You said you were promoted. No more crawl spaces or ladders. There are nails at the office. Would you lie to your wife about your job, Dr. Hamid? He doesn't have to. He's doing the job he was meant to do. And all my husband does is punish himself because he's not. Can we fight about this when I feel better? Before you were fine. When things get real, you're sick. Andrew. I want to go home, Samir. Yes, okay. The doctors have it handled. I'll be home in no time. You know what I meant. Our home. Jan, it's time. You're the only one who can't see it. I'll give you a minute. Wait. I need a blood test. Anjou, why? Are you okay? I'm pregnant, Samir. Or at least I think I am. Now you see how it feels to be kept in the dark? I'm so we staying. Living the high life. Oh, look at this. Isn't to everyone's taste. I don't like it at all. There's too much poshness. I definitely think I'll prefer my sausage sandwich. Rich House, Poorhouse, Thursday on one and on TV and Z-plus.

We tried for so long. Would you like to see your baby? Let me back for you. In my back from. You know in my faith, you tie a door when you ask for a blessing. And we'd ask for one before we came here. But I'd given up. And Samir never gives up. Yes, I noticed. It's going to be a little cold. Heartbeat is strong. I'd say about eight weeks. It wasn't his dream to come to Canada. It was mine. I said that there would be more opportunity for us. It's always like that. I dream and he does. And Samir worked so hard to make it happen. And we were both so excited. But the reality... It was not what you expected. I'm not saying it would be easy to go back, but we had a life in Delhi. And we have family we miss. And he could be an engineer there. Will Samir be okay, Dr. Hamid? He's still very weak, and he needs a lot of rest so his body can fight the infection. We wanted this for so long. What if it happened at the wrong time? So barium is harmless but gross. So for every sip you get down, I'll take one too, deal. Just think of it as a milkshake, a radioactive chalk milkshake. So how you like in Toronto? Your dad seems to think you're getting used to it. Him and my mom really want me too. When I started at this hospital, I remember knowing no one. I used to eat alone at the calf and I'd pretend to read. I don't even go to ours anymore. It's the food suck. I almost never feel like eating. Just because when I don't have to, I feel better. Like you're in control? I found this group online, other people who feel the same way. And we sort of set goals for each other, cheer each other on when we make them. What kind of goals? Eating less calories. And, um... Throwing up. If we eat something bad I know it shouldn't feel good but it does why do you think you're telling me this I know that if I tell my dad I know I should stop but Do you want to stop? I don't know how. Well, I can help with that. And I can be there when you talk to your dad if you think that would make it easier. Frank's testosterone is low. You're thinking Andrew Potts? And when you give him the results to the scope, you should tell him that too. Oh, I won't be giving him either of those results. I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to see me, and you seem to have a problem with how I deal with him, so. Frank's afraid, June. And like most of us, he covers with bravado. You may have to peel back yours to make room for him to do the same. So you want me to act meat so he can feel strong? Maybe there's a way for you to meet him in the middle. A stressed out resident of Dr. Weir's was looking through. Something about needing a counsel for the exposed liver patient who had yesterday? No, it's not Weir who needs me. It's Allison, the bystander who saved Warren's life. She heard his blood pressure was low, and she's not convinced that I'm the person to interrogate it with her. Do you think she's right? No, I think I should stay out of it, and so should she, but she won't let it go. So her relentlessness irritates you? Yes, I see the irony. Should I let them know you're coming? Dr. Leblanc, you came. While you left me no choice, I have a roster of patients in a merge, but senior surgeons are dragging me here because of you. Who, Weir? I haven't seen him all day, just different residents every three hours, and each time I'm the one bringing them up to speed. Allison, I spoke to Dr. Weir myself. Warren's blood pressure is low, but in the acceptable range. But it's dropping in waves, and each time it levels it's a little bit lower and his breathing gets shallow. Okay, stop. You just have to stop. I can't. Look, maybe you don't understand, but I know that if I walk away when I could have made a difference, that's just not the kind of person that I want to be. Look, I've been watching him more than anyone else for a full day now, and I am telling you, he is paler than he was before. Now, you're the one who found the injury underneath his liver. If you tell me that he's okay, I promise I'll accept it. Okay, Allison, one more look. Thank you. It's impossible? What? A foreign body near Warren's heart. It could be glass from the accident. They would have imaged his abdomen where the wound was, but maybe it traveled through his bloodstream. What does that mean? That you may have just saved his life again.

What, what? They'll just they'll, of their life to them the best to be to live in a place in a place. Mr. Gupta, what are you doing out of bed? Anjou hasn't come to see me. I need to talk to her. Anju is fine. She just needs a little bit of time. I'm concerned that your infection has spread to your bloodstream. It's called bacteremia and it could be lethal. Let me take you back to your room. I promised her a future here. If we go home now, I feel my wife and with my child. Do you understand? The life I built and the home I knew doesn't exist anymore. I would give anything to get that back. Let me take you back to your room. Thank you. Hey, his heart beats elevated and he's cold and clammy. Tell the intensivist he could be in septic shock. Go! See me. Since when aren't we honest with each other? Why won't you talk to me? Whatever it is, I need to know. Guys, is everything okay? Because I got the results back from imaging. There's no sign of obstructions or ulcers. So it is psychological then? That's what the other doctor, the kid, just told me. I'm very sorry. You never should have heard that from him. Dima, whatever it is, we can fix it. There's nothing to fix. He just told you the test didn't find anything. Can we just go? No. No, not until one of you tells me what's going on. We all need to just take a deep breath and we'll talk this through. Okay? And we'll talk this through, okay? The lab rushed your biopsy, and it's not a plastic anemia. Look, I know it's been a stressful time, but we had to check. Let me guess. You have another theory about why I'm anemic. Actually, we know why. You have low T. Sometimes it's called andropause, but basically it just means that your testosterone levels are declining. I mean, sometimes this happens when men get older. You know, this is pretty good news considering the alternative, Mr. Bozina. That I'm basically less of a man? You just supplement your testosterone, make some lifestyle changes, and on the surface, it just looks like you're taking better care of yourself. Yeah, but underneath, I'm a blubber and mess. I mean, show me someone who isn't, right? I can't remember the last time I let a woman see me cry. Same here. Okay, I'll be fine. And I'll get that shoulder fixed ASAP. Thanks, though. Yeah. It's very serious, Mrs. Gupta. The surgeons need to cut out the infected tissue from beneath his original puncture wound to keep it from poisoning his bloodstream. Will that save him? Do our best. Samir. Andrew. I don't care where we are. As long as we're together, huh? There's my husband. It's time. You come back to your family.

What? What happened? They did everything they could, but the glass pierced his heart. Warren's dead? Were we too late? I'm so sorry, Allison. His body was still weak, recovering from trauma, which makes it harder to survive a major surgery. Then if I hadn't pushed for us to do something, did I cause this? No, this was not your fault. But I got involved. And I'm grieving someone I don't even know. Do you know what that's like? If I was never going to be able to help him, then what was the point? Frank found out that was low tea. How'd you take it? Yeah, he handled it. But you think maybe you could just pretend I didn't tell you. I don't think he wants anyone to know. Good point. Hey, do you have some of your group distill in surgery? I haven't heard anything. You want me to call? Yes, please. Do you have any idea what you did? Breaking Dimitri's confidence like that?

I was supposed to get off on one, but I didn't. I heard about your liver laceration. He died? Yeah. How's your good scenario? Blaming herself, asking why she even got involved at all. Because that's who she is and no one else would have. It's not fair. How you for me? Yes, a letter to your program director, and a formal offer for you to do your clinical hours here when they officially start next month. So I don't get to even consider any other options? I mean, thank you for deciding my future for me. Not deciding anything, Claire. I'm just making an offer. No, you're trying to hold on to me. Look. I know you don't want things to change, Jen. No, you're trying to hold on to me. Look. I know you don't want things to change, Jed. But they already have. And you are acting like you're facing all this head-on, and you haven't once told me what you feel about the fact that you can't work on patients. Well, I'm adjusting. No. You're deflecting. There's a difference. I heard you're looking for me? Yeah, you got a minute? Didn't have you pegged as a smoker. A secret and very infrequent vice. I really messed up there. No, I did. Putting the dad on you, knowing how he is, and then losing it on you, just... It's not cool. Did I tell you both my parents are surgeons? So you're used to perfectionist doctors? Perfectionist, divorced doctors. I split when I was 14, and when the myth of perfection ended, they got to just, I don't know. Be themselves, I don't know, they themselves, I guess. I'll see you more, J. I'm gonna. I was glad to hear how well you're responding, Samir. Your surgeons tell me you'll likely be discharged in a few days. Thank you. The next time I ask for a blessing, it will be for you to find your way home again. It's been for you, I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you. It's been two weeks, Mr. Klein. I know. You said Khalid would only be in detention one day. I know, but he's okay. The spirits are good, considering, and we are doing everything we can. Whatever it takes. If it's a question of money, I'll pay it. If Alad asked him to pass along his things. And I continue to believe our appeal has a chance, but... Well, you may want to get your head around the idea that if things don't work out, he could be deported. You know, I'm going to be able to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to Thank you."}
