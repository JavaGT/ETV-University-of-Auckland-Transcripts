Yeah, it's opened a real can of worms, Sam. A skull found in a Wellington backyard. A human skull could hold the answer to an 80-year-old cold case of a missing New Zealand woman. Last Saturday, Wades Town resident gardening in their backyard found something pretty shocking, that skull. And police have given the remains to the Institute of Environmental Search and Research for Testing. So far, they don't know too much about it except that it looks very old. Enter a Kiwi true crime author. He's got a theory. He says it could be related to the mysterious case of Gene Martin. She disappeared in the very same spot in 1945. And joining us now is that author, Scott Bainbridge. Welcome to Scott. Tell us a little bit about Jean's story. Yeah, sure. Gene Martin was a 23-year-old lab technician from Hawks Bay, and she was working in what became the DSIR in Wellington back in 1945. One Sunday afternoon, she went for a walk in Rawton's Bush with a friend. And when the walk came to an end, her friend left to go home. And Jean decided to stay on for whatever reason to continue on. But she's never been seen again. And it's one of our biggest mysteries. Scott, was it a big case at the time? Was it well covered? Did it sort of capture the nation? No, not really, Amanda. Gene disappeared the week that the Second World War ended. So as you can imagine, that dominated the news. So news of his disappearance was really relegated to sort of the back pages and small articles. So no, it didn't receive the coverage that it possibly should have. What would need to happen to prove it was her? Some sort of tests on the skull. Now, Jean had protruding front teeth and she had a couple of teeth missing at the side. So it may be reasonably easy to determine. But I guess the first thing would be to determine how old the skull is and, of course, find the rest of the remains. Amazingly, Jean's little sister Peggy is still alive. She's in her late 90s now. How incredible would it be for her to get some closure before she died? I think it would be wonderful. And it's something that I would say that Peggy and the rest of the family would have given up on, you know, an awful long time ago, but for this to occur now, you know, crossing fingers that it is, Jean, would be wonderful. Scott, good luck. Thanks so much for your time tonight. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Hey God, everyone. Watch the Long for Project. Look, we've got Mark Richardson over there. We've got Josh Thompson and Amanda Gillies in the house. And I think everyone is sort of susceptible to these mysterious cold cases. You've been getting into a bit of true crime lately. Yeah, I listen to True Crime Podcasts as I go to sleep and my dreams are filled with horror. How do you get a skull without a body? Well, I think it's just been a few years. You know, you don't expect the whole skeleton to be intact. The body just sort of wanders off. Yeah, well, probably best not to think about it. I'm going to say, I've missed you so much, Mark Richardson. True crime with Mark Richardson. Something's a missed here. Also tonight is your parenting style. I worry about Mark's kids now is your parenting style the best one. All the worst will speak to an Aussie parent whose televised experiments seeks to find the best way to raise our kids. And he's been the baddie of the big screen. Now James Brolin tells us about the show that's brought him back to TV. And New Zealand, we are going into Orange at midnight. And Mark Richardson has told me that he will be queuing up outside the viaduct so he can get down with his bad self at midnight on the dock. Let's celebrate with the Daily Doe. Yeah, boy! Oh, first up, have you ever dropped your keys down a drain? Fortunately for this key owner, it happened outside of Bunnings Warehouse and the employees came to save the day. Let's have a look. Oh, the lads have russed up a makeshift key grabbing device from the hardware store. Looks like it's going to work, actually. It looks good. Oh, no, that's working. Has he got it? He's got it. I'm pretty sure he flipped the camera around. Hey! He goes, oh! That's why I keep my keys on the lanyard. Plus, it makes me look really cool. Next up, last night I watched the football ferns take on Australia. And poor Aussie number 14, Alana Kennedy, got herself into a bit of a spot of bother. Here she is going for a header and instead she takes another head straight to the nose. See if you can spot when she sees herself on the big screen. And just how far her nose is broken out of joint. Well, she might need a bit of help from a plastic suit and so Mark, if you could give the number of the guy you use. Josh. She probably wants a good one though He's very good isn't he? You look You've got a great voice And finally I don't know what it is about this video of a man getting hit by a baseball But I simply cannot stop watching it Okay let's have a look Here's the pitch And oh Wow Can we see that again? Can we see. Whoa. Can we see that again? Can we see that again? Yeah. Look, and here we go. And, blah, there we go. All I can say is Mour! When it comes to parenting, everyone has an opinion, but is there a right and a wrong way? A new TV experiment in Australia aims to find out. We'd like to raise our children to respect authority. We have high expectations of our children. Ten couples, ten parenting styles. This is a raw, confronting look at how you should raise your kids. The children are always paying attention to all of our surroundings. It's an education that can't be gained any other way. From helicopter parents to free-range routine obsessed parents and even some extreme authoritarian, they're all trying to prove their way is best. We see a smack as one tool in a parenting toolbox. It doesn't sit well with me. Through a series of tough challenges, each parent's methods are put to the test and debated by the others. All in a bit to find out whose parenting style rises above the rest and to stir up a bit of drama. Host of parental guidance, Alison Langdon joins us now from Sydney. Now, Alison, you've seen the results of this parenting social experiment and you're also a parent yourself. Were you surprised by the huge range of parenting styles on the show? I had no idea that people even had styles. I mean, I think mine would be like the flip-flopper or something would be my style, you know. One day I'm strict, the next day I'm free range. And, you know, what it made me realize is I'm pretty sure I'm messing up my kids. Yeah, I'm hearing you there. There's some pretty extreme parenting techniques on the show. Do you think that's usual or are most parents somewhere in the middle? Well, I mean, let's take smacking, right? Because that's, we just, first episode, let's dive into the really big issue. I still think a lot of families do. And so the reaction in the room, when our strict parents say we smack, and we smack with a wooden spoon, I was surprised by how much emotion was in that room, how much anger was in the room. I remember at one point saying to everyone, put your hand up if you've smacked, because a lot of people were really angry with strict parents. Nearly every parent in that room put their hand up, which I thought was pretty telling. Yeah, and I have to say, smacking is illegal in New Zealand now, so I think Kiwis will be pretty surprised by that. Hey, what else can we expect to see on the show? Another challenge which you were going to see this week, it's a really big one to stranger danger. And I was really surprised who, the kids I thought, who wouldn't go with the strangers because of the way they were brought out, and vice versa. I was really surprised how that one played out. And it was, again, it was really emotional in the room because I think, you know, it's pretty confronting when that moment where a couple of kids decide if they will or won't go with a stranger, breaks your heart, breaks your heart. What about like good cop, bad cop? Do you think that works? Well, it happens in our house. I mean, so perfect example. I mean, you know, I do early starts and then I had to fly to Brisbane. I got home about 6 o'clock last night. And I was tired, right, putting my four-year-old to bed and he acts up. And then I hear myself going, I'm counting to three and I'm leaving this room and I'll send your father into you. And then I just had this moment of like, oh, that's what my parents used to do. This is what I'm trying to portray my husband. Poor old Mike. He's going to be the bad cop all the time. But, you know, just got to, you know, in the moment we do what we do, don't we? We make mistakes. Good days, bad days. Absolutely. One of my favourite things is always ask your father gets me out of every sicky situation. Alison, we are loving your show. Can't wait for it to be on tonight. Thank you so much for your time. Nice to talk to you. Yeah, my wife started watching it actually, and I wish you wouldn't because I'd just get growled at nowadays, so doing it all wrong. Oh, really? I can't exactly tell her to stop watching reality TV, can I? Well, yeah, to be honest, when my wife watches the block, she tells me I'm doing it all wrong, so maybe it's just a pattern. Yeah, we need to do something about it, don't we? Anyway, parental guidance continues right after this show. Every Wednesday on three, it is a very good watch. Now, it's being called the Olympics of Kappa Haka, but many Kiwis haven't heard of the Matatini.

And tonight, Hollywood actor Josh Brolin. He's in a new TV series. But how did he end up riding a motorbike across New Zealand? You'll tell us that story shortly. But first, two weeks ago, we brought you the incredible story of Monty the Dog, who won global fame a decade ago after learning to drive. After a long career in showbiz, Monty died suddenly at the weekend from a heart condition. Trainer Mark Vetti called him a beloved companion who lived a rich and wonderful life. We all remember that, eh? You'd hear someone laugh at him. I'm not laughing. I was really sad, but I mean, just animals doing human stuff. He's even like driving one-handed, like cool dude, you know? I will say, Monty captured the imagination of New Zealand and the world, and it all happened here in this 7pm slot on 3. So everyone watching who remembers him. A lot of love going out for Monty and Alterra tonight. Well, Josh Brolin has been a king of the big screen for almost 40 years, recently appearing in June, which won lots of awards recently. So what did it take to get him back on the small screen after nearly 20 years? Haven't you ever heard of that guy? What's his name? The pirate guy? One-Aid Willie. Josh Brolin landed his first big movie role in the Goonies back in 1985. He later went from boy to man and men and black three. We need pie. Pie? Yeah. He's played not one but two Marvel villains, cable and Deadpool 2. There's nothing I can't kill. And fan favorite Thanos. I am inevitable. More recently, he added to the success of Academy Award winning June. Now he's a rancher at the center of a genre-bending Western Outer Range, his first TV series in 20 years. I don't know what it is. While fighting for his land and covering up a murder, Brolin's character uncovers a mystery like no other. And on behalf of 5 million New Zealanders, I welcome Josh Brolin. Well, look, I don't know about you, but I love it when my wife and I find something on TV that we both enjoy equally. Is this show of yours a good one for us? I don't know. You tell me, I mean, look, man, you know, when you test these things, and there is testing involved, it was interesting to me how equal it was between male and female. Do you know what I mean? And usually you have a male contingency that's way above the female or the other way around, you know, and there's a Timothy Chalamee in there and all the people are like, oh, yeah, Ryan Gosling's. But, you know, I felt like ours was fairly across the board equal, and we were happy to see it. And there's no binging this one, just two eps of the show out each week, which means we're going to have to wait, which is kind of like the old days, right? It was great. We've gotten so used to binging, and even me, that I don't have a lot of time to watch a lot of TV. So when I do, I just want to sit and I want to consume the whole thing. And the truth of the matter is like what you're talking about, when Fonzie was in the air in Happy Days, and he was jumping the shark, and they froze him halfway right at the peak of that trajectory. And it said to be continued, and you were like, no, no. But in hindsight, there's something so great about that moment because you had a way an entire week and you talked about it for its entire week and you got Fs on all your tasks. And it's just the most debilitating moment, but is the greatest memory in hindsight. I totally agree. Now, I know you worked with our Kiwi mate, Julian Denison and Deadpool too, but have you ever actually been here to New Zealand? Norman Reed is from Walking Dead, right? I had never met, but he had reached out to me at some point. He said, you know, I have this show called Ride, and I would love for you to do the show. And I said, well, I don't really do, you know, that kind of stuff, because I get really uncomfortable and I just don't know what to do. But so he would call me and say, what about Brazil? What about this? What about that? And it was about a year and a half and he was so sweet. He never got frustrated. He never got mad, at least to me. And then finally he said New Zealand. I said, when? And they ended up because I've always wanted to go to New Zealand. And we ended up on the North Island of New Zealand, which is a lot like where I'm from in the Central Coast. And we rode all over the North Island of New Zealand, which is a lot like where I'm from in the Central Coast. And we rode all over the North Island of New Zealand, and I loved it, man. The people there, the terrain, the climate. It was fantastic. So that's the truth. That's all right. Josh Rowland. Thank you so much for your time. Pretty cool guy, right? He's a very good-looking guy, I think we all agree. Would you recognise someone like, do you recognise famous people when you see them out of context? I think proper Hollywood celebrities like that if you ran into them, they would sort of glow, right? Yeah, I recognised you when you walked in today. That's true. Was I glowing? Glowing, totally. Here's a fun fact. We're talking parenting style today. His step-mom is Barbara Streisand. Wow. The show's called Out of Range. It premieres on Prime Video this Friday, and you can check it out there. Beat that is coming up. And one of the country's biggest competitions turns 50 this year. It attracts audiences in the tens of thousands. And participants spend years of practicing just for 25 minutes of glory. So what is it all about? You ask. Europe has Eurovision. The US has extreme cheerleading. But heaps better than any of that and found nowhere else in the world is Alteiro's very own Tematini. Held every other year in a different city each time, it's basically the Kappa Haka Olympics. Each team has 40 performers and 25 minutes to demonstrate six disciplines. Fakaeke. More teatia. to demonstrate six disciplines. Fakaeke. Moeathea, and Fakawaitia. Pai, Faka Waiata Aringa, the way atollahua Tia. And Bacowatea. The winners and runners-up take home these beautiful taonga, with the mana of the entire nation. For me and my cup, it's probably around four to five months before maters-sitting when you start practicing. Originally called the Polynesian Festival, the first one was held in Rotorua to an audience of 3,000. The most recent at Wellington's Caketon drew 60,000 people, plus 1.1 million more watching on telly and online, taking the opportunity to soak up te re-maori, dikanga Māori and a big, beautiful dose of home-grown music and culture. We're joining us tonight to talk a little bit more about the Matatini is one of Altao's very own kaiwaiata. Aras Pere Wihongi, kia-a-kha-a-kha-kha-a-khae. Yeah, thank you. Come on to the kupapa. Hey, what do you lovea. Come on. Come on. Go on to the co-pa. Hey, what do you love about, te matatini? Oh, look, it's such a holistic event and that it promotes so much health for our people. But really, it's the social aspect to it as well. Outside of all of the knowledge that we're singing about, the history that we're performing, the vocals, of course, that I really love and I fell in love with kapaaka because of the vocals. Really, there's a social aspect to it. It being the biggest events in the Māori calendar, but it attracts so many, and it's not just for Māori as well. There are so many different cultures and diversities that come through to this event and this kau-papa that's open for everybody. So I really love the social aspect of this kau-papa, yeah. The performances are beautiful, but what makes a great performance? Oh, that's a good question. Well, there's a few aspects, but for myself personally, I was brought up under the tutelage of, I guess, the perspective that there's so many different aspects to a performance. Of course, first and foremost, there's the vocal side, and with that comes all everything that you hear. So all of the audio, all of the harmonies, the melodies, the lyrics. And then, of course, there's everything that you see. And so that's the performance, that's your actions, that's your witty and your Pukana, girl. But I think for myself personally, what makes a great performance is everything that you feel. So when watching a performance, when listening and being able to experience a performance, the actual performances that really make an impact on myself, the ones that generate a feeling within me, yeah. Beautiful. There's so many things for kids to be into these days, like smartphones or chatterings. I don't know what kids are going to do, but what does it say about this that there's still so much interest in it? You're right, you're right. I think the beauty about this co-pipa actually is that we're bringing traditional stories to our modern-day context. So, I mean, for Māori, our means of storytelling have always been through Motea, through chant and through waiata. And so we're continuing on that tradition, that custom. But we're also bringing in stories from this day and age. We're also creating narratives from this day and age to of course encourage more stories and remember more history in the next 50 plus years of to Matatine to come. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Paterhaire. Pere and her friends will be back in a few minutes of the live performance but for now please thank Pere Wihongi. And it's time to beat that on the project. This week we're asking you to deliver the news differently. We want you to recreate the project at home, like last night's winner Minka Brooks, who did us out of Lego. Very good work, Minka. We loved it, but we got more entries today, including this one, a little video from Rosa and Lily Bell. Check it out. The theme is, it's an animal. Let's take a look. That dog took a tremendous trip. Very good, guys. We love it. Lynn decided to create a vegetable-based version of the show. It's not the project, she calls it their produce. There's the little live audience, the Fijas in the front. They're all great. But actually, it was another Lego version of the project that wins tonight. Look at all the effort that Leo has put into this, the lighting, the crew, the live audience. He's even got the little focus going on there. Leo, you are our beat that winner for the ZEP. And a worthy one. Yeah, very good. If you think you can beat that, take a shot at your version of the project and send it to our Facebook page. You could win a JVL Bluetooth speaker and an Instax camera. And remember short week, so if you want to enter, do it tonight or first thing tomorrow morning and send it into us. That's the only way you can win. Very good tip, and there's more to come on the project."}
