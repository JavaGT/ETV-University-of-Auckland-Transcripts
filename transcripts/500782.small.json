Now on the project, Patty you're bringing Bridgeton to New Zealand. Yes, I love Bridgeton. I don't know about you two. Have you ever watched it? No, I haven't seen it, I have to say. Well, you should watch it because if like me you're a big fan and I'm about to meet another huge fan who could not get enough of Bridgeton. And in fact, she loves it so much, she's found a way of bringing it to life right here in Altero. All is fair in love and war. Have you been watching Bridgeton? It's basically pride and prejudice meets Gossip Girl and it is huge. We can pretend to form an attachment. Every presumptuous mother in town will leave me alone and every suitor will be looking at you. The second season dropped on Netflix last month and viewers are breaking records to watch it. This is the season. The Viscount intends to find a wife. You honestly just did that? I believe I did. In case you missed it, the series follows the Regency era Bridgeton family as they navigate true love and pure old-fashioned scandal. Come now, it is not proper to stand. Bismar Marmud is obsessed. The 20-year-old Auckland woman needed more of her favourite show. Why don't we have a Bridgeton-themed Winter Ball in New Zealand? And that's exactly what she's planning. Wow, Bismar joins us now, and you are planning a Bridget and Ball in Auckland. Tell us how did this all come about? Yeah, so I was watching Bridgeton like any other person on Netflix, a random Wednesday, and I was like, why don't we do this in New Zealand? And my brain just works like that where it's like I come up with random ideas and I see if I can like execute it and so literally the next day I started asking people around and went to the gym and started asking the gym rows like the girls guys everyone and that was my marker research done and I was like you know what I should make a tick-talk and see if like other people are interested. I have a confession to make I've never watched Bridgetton before So what do you love about that show? Yeah, so the show is great because it shows a lot of diversity representation. The main leads are dark-skinned brown girls, which is super refreshing to see, and it's quite rare to see that on screen and like mainstream channels. And they really did a good job of including the culture from India. I'm Pakistani myself but like there's a lot of similarities between that and other cultures and they did an amazing job with a set, the deck or the jewelry, the casting, like it was just so beautifully done so how could you not love it? Yeah and I have a confession to make as well. I love Brigitan and in particular I love the orchestral versions. And I love the music. I love the orchestral versions of contemporary songs and I'm assuming you're going to do the same at the ball. Yeah, so we're thinking of really like making sure that people get like get the full of Regency era experience so the music will definitely be a key part of the event we're even looking at having the internal ball committee take classes beforehand to get like the dancing right and then we like teach people on social media beforehand to get that hype going and to make sure like people like I'm there save me a ticket you said enough save me a ticket save me a said enough. You've said enough. Save me a ticket. Save me a ticket. Bridgeton's known for being... How do I put this? Raunchy. Sexy. Filthy. But in a good way... Do you think the ball's got similar potential? family friendly and like PG because there's a lot of young people coming I would imagine but you know we're at a little bit of drama we have some like characters involved like we'll have someone playing the Queen who picks a diamond of the season and you're like there'll be fun elements to it but yeah we'll have it family friendly. Bismar all the best for your ball to be a brave person who bets against your success thanks for joining us this evening. No problem. Thank you for having me. This is the project and Jackie Brown is here. Oh! I love feeling up the friday funky vibes. The thing about Bridgeton is we're talking about the sex, well actually the great thing is that it's mainly told from a female point of view, the female gaze in this, which is quite unusual in shows. I mean, I had no idea. It was so raunchy, sexy, filthy. Totally in. I'm honestly going to deal up. She's loving it. People are on, after Bismar put out that Tik Tuk, after Bismar put out that TikTok, she got 700 people offering to help.p. people who want tickets that's 700 that want to be on the committee. Yeah it's going to be huge and I just want to remind people here it's not filthy Friday it's fun, fun, fun, fun, right. Also to know which one of these characters has the stuff to win it all in Dancing with the Stars we'll talk to Eli Matheson and Sonia Gray next and who knew you could have so much fun with board people who was the most bored kid in New Zealand will announce the winner just ahead. Sure, watching celebrity's dance for your approval is great, but it doesn't hold a candle to watching idiotic humans seek your approval on the internet. It's time for the daily dose. What a time! Potato chips, undoubtedly the king of snacks, and this video proves just how sought after they really are.. Mummums trying to take a quick snack here pops the chip in the look, oh, oh, where's it go, how'd it? At least get a little kiss on that. Never too early to learn about ghost chips though, up next who doesn't love trying to throw food into your friend's mouth from a distance? It's a great away though you can make it even more fun. so he's being doing his good. Michael Jordan, he's being the net. They're throwing marshmallows. He's wondering why his friends are laughing so much. We're out to find out. Oh! Oh no. As they say, you've got to break a few eggs to make an idiot. And last up, the blindfold bottle bottle bottle bottle bottle bottle challenge. challenge, you'll know I'm a little I'm a bit's the height of human stupidity my new theory though based on this next video is the bottle is choosing its target seriously check this out what we see here is the bottle like sample it's target first right so it's the one left the one on the right but then it picks on the girl in black at the back we've cut her editor down so we get through one for her and that's the second one for her. And just when she thinks she's in the clear, here comes number three. And it's a goodie! And she's down! In the bottles defence, that girl had just made a joke about its wife's alopecia. So... Oh, Jeremy, relevant, Karen. That was your daily dose..... I want you to get down, shake your groove thing. Yeah, yeah. It's time to cut a rug, but not with scissors, no, with your feet, because a new season of dancing with the Stars, New Zealand, is here. And guess what? It stars one of my BFFs. Who doesn't love the spy skills? I mean, you're not, let, let, let, and you're red, let, and you're red, we're not It's exactly as hard as I knew it would be. Growing royalty does some lady lifting. That felt easy. And check out the high kicks of this comedian. I feel like my leg's just where who do you think we are? Something for everyone. Please welcome, Maylon, that you're sitting in Sonia Gray! All right. All right. All ready, Dansen. We are so excited to have you here here tonight.. We are so excited to have you here tonight. How much convincing though did you both need to go on the show? Starting off first with you Sonia. I'm zero. Oh really? I love it. I love it. I love it. Oh yes. Yeah, I love it. So, great opportunity to be. You know? Yeah, and I've been flattered with Laura Daniel for quite a few years and I went through the whole experience with her. So I was like, yes. And then they were like, do you want to dance with a dude? And I was like, double yes. Are you there to be friends or at the end of the day this is fierce competition? I don't think, I mean I don't think it's a sort of show where it's about rivalries, it's just about doing the best that you can do. Oh everybody. Yeah, early days. Yeah, early days. Yeah, every day. Yeah, yeah.., wait till mid competition when you're, let's go deep on the emotions. What are your biggest fears around this experience? I'd say this might be the same for you too. Just not doing my best, you know, just not for my family and for the charity and for the fans and friends and stuff, yeah, just kind of falling over or farting or puking. I don't like TV. So you just obface me. Really? You're like a fat puke. Yeah, it's fine. There's a lot of information. There gets votes. Both and information. I don't know. I don't know much about dancing, but I do know a little about TV and I reckon a bit of that TV, I had to tell Patty up a few times. You're not Mike while you're dancing I think so no one here right? Just the live studio audience. I do have a question can the both of you dance? I've watched you can dance. Doing a little nubber last night and yeah he just had the groove. I'm not giving away the dance but doing any of them I? No, no. but I was watching him, sorry I said this to you, but behind the scenes I said not giving away the dance but doing it am I? No, no, no but I was watching sorry I said this to you but behind the scenes I said you couldn't tell her the dance wasn't who's the pro. Wow! Now without bringing up the charity I mean here's a chance to pitch to New Zealand because people will be voting for both of you you know what why should you win? Oh why should you vote for me? Yeah. Because I am dancing for you and you. Oh, thorny good. You're at home? Basically, it's a private dance. Oh. Oh! A private dance for 99 cents for 99 cents. you should vote for me first ever same-sex couple on the show I said let us home it is homophobic. Actually because there's another issue there you like because you're a Matuson and you got Reese Matuson as well and you both comedians any chance of confusion between the two of you? So many questions about whether we're brothers or right but our names are spelled very differently. You're two teas? I'm two teas, he's one tea. And we're very different today. Yeah, my friends at the radio at the edge. This is why I ask, yeah, this. So that's a prank, right? That's a prank. We're in the wrong careers. We will see you two on Dancing with the Stars starting from Sunday night. Please thank E'Lai Matheson and Sonja Gray.

But first a dentist says kissing could be as good for you as brushing your teeth. Like if you're not, Dr. Kharleid Kacim said on top of brushing and flossing, people should kiss for four minutes a day. Kissing booths, saliva production and saliva neutralizes the essence that said on your teeth, which reduces the back. Kissing booths to live a production and saliva neutralizes the essence that's it on your teeth, which reduces the risk of getting tooth decay on top of that. Exposure to the bacteria in your partner's mouth can boost your immune system. But of course there are risks kissing people with bad oral hygiene is a no-no, and stay away from any lips with a cold sore. Well this is going to be an awkward four minutes for my kids to watch at breakfast every morning. Oh! And there's going to be an awkward four minutes with my colleagues after the show tonight. What? I can wait now. Okay, we're going to discuss this. Which one? No, all of us. One, one, and a 20 each. I understand. This isn't me. Sounds like rubbish. Absolutely rubbish. Because how much saliva are they anticipating that you're going to generate with this kiss? I'm not a big saliva- Giver. No. I'll give you maybe quarter of a teaspoon in a kiss. Yeah, I'm assuming it's a bit rubbish. I'm not over a tatte, he's one minute 20. Yeah, I'm going to change it. I am going to change the subject because we all know someone who's lost a parent and when that person is a kid, it's really really tough. And that's why one writer teamed up with a family, to write a book to help kids through grief. Even if my body is no longer here, you'll feel me around and know my soul's there. In the golden hour of sunlight that streams on your face or the clouds that form shapes up in high spaces. Last December journalist Chloe Willits interviewed Emma Blundell about a fundraiser she was running for her nephew. Two days later Emma died from cancer leaving behind three children, two stepchildren and her husband. Thanks to Chloe, Emma also left behind a children's book. I think she wanted something that would make it a lot easier for everyone. And so yeah, we sat and talked before the interview for about an hour about what she would want in a book about grief for kids and what death meant to her in that time. She's got two days of life to go and she wants to write a book that's going to help other people. That's right. We got married, she wrote a book, you know, let alone getting all the will stuff and all the rest of it sorted out. She was just giving, giving, giving, giving all the time. After this powerful conversation, you actually go home and write a whole book. Yeah. How did you do it so quickly? I just, it was fresh. I was obviously had emotions. It meant so much to me. I really wanted her to be able to see it. That was probably my main driver. Chloe had already written one children's book, the dizzy waggle Who Litt the Dark, aimed at helping children deal with anxiety. She used the same characters, this time dealing with grief. Two o'clock in the morning I got the email saying, I've read in the book, and I'm like, wow, it was all our feelings, and she just put it together amazingly. So Em got to read, read that and she just loved it. Literally, he's hit the nail on her head. They loved it so much that Emma's daughter Willow read it at her funeral. The toey first mother of Jeannie a Pie, you can't forget love and it's carried inside. The book is about how bright the dizzy waggle makes friends with Thea Atou who then passes away. Despite your speed riding you actually had to add in a bit then you. There was one page that one part that hadn't been put in that we put in after she passed away and that was about seeing signs in nature of your loved one. It says that Yeah Thea visited secretly in the most magical ways which I think is a really beautiful way for kids to be able to look out for things like butterflies or feathers or shooting stars just to give them that sense of comfort as well that maybe the love on is visiting. I'll be the star glowing biggest and brightest at dark a pahoota-cawa flower blooming from branches of bark when one day I leave you and life then ticks on I'll still be part of nature's beautiful soul. But the kids love it so we're reading up and it's making them happy and it's making life easier for them. We talk about it and it's just normal and they know where she is. It's in the spire at night and there's emistare and they'll debate it. No, that's her star there, that's her star there. I guess it's as simple but as complex as the fact that when someone's gone, no matter even if their body's gone, they're still a part of you, they're still a part of nature. You can't forget them if they're missing someone. and thought of loved ones flooding around in the sky as birds actually and I thought that's a wonderful message and I do know that Chloe wants this book to be available to every child in New Zealand through schools or through hospitals or hospices or anything like that she's published to herself she needs help to get it out there and I'm sure there will be people out there who need it. I myself took a copy off her and dropped it off to a family I know who are unfortunately going through this situation and that's how useful this book is. We're living in such a great time now where we're able to talk about this stuff and books are available when my dad died when I was in my 20s. There wasn't really anything there for me. I mean I could have got counselling I guess but it wasn't something that was talked about so much. just sort of deal with it on your own so the fact that this is out and conversations with me encouraged is such a beautiful thing yeah and if you want to find out more about it go to the project Facebook page or the dizzy waggle has its own Facebook page as well now time to change things up a little bit happier because it is time for beat that and tonight it is the broadest kids in Alterra, New Zealand. Check out the shot of Amber waiting for the adults. She's there. She's over. And she's waiting there for a while really battling with boredom there. And Mason, old mate Mason, Mace, was trying to entertain himself with his toy car. Not sure if it's working properly though from Macy. Now, Harry and Sienna sent us their holiday to do list. Number seven on the list seems to be the boring bit. Look closely at that. Right, to hype you about Jeremy Corbett, how dare you. That would be the highest any kids holiday. They'd look forward to it. There will be the most boring piece of poetry in history of the human race. Those were great but they couldn't stop last they couldn't talk. Last night's winner Charlie who got a little bit fitter waiting for his parents waiting waiting waiting somewhere a little child waits.
