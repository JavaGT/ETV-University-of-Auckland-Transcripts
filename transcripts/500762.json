Today on RNZ National, inflation figures released later this morning, will show the biggest annual rise in more than 30 years. The Taranaki community is calling for more information about the police shooting of chaos prices. Authorities remain tight-lipped. Also Ukrainian fighters in Maripol refuse a Russian deadline to surrender. And the country's overall immunity to COVID is waning and 980,000 eligible people are still without a booster shot. Your weather today, there's rain or showers for most across the moment. RNZ News at 6 o'clock morning. Good morning. I'm Anna Thomas. A financial mentor says households are well and truly feeling the pinch as the cost of living continues to soar. Inflation is expected to reach 7% when data for the first three months of the year is released later today, the largest annual rise in more than 30 years. Shirley McComb is the general manager of Bay Financial Mentors and says belts have been tightening for some time. A whole lot more people are eating vegetarian meals. I think a whole lot more people are trying to pad meals out with rice and pasta and as the food banks will tell you, a huge amount more people are engaging with food banks just to make it from week to week. Shirley McComb says it's not true that only beneficiaries are seeking out help with the squeezed middle class increasingly in need. A Ukrainian Marine commander in the besieged port of Mariupol has issued a desperate appeal to world leaders to extract soldiers and civilians who were trapped in a steelworks there. In a video address, Major Siri Volnyard said they were probably facing their last days or hours. The BBC's Dan Johnson reports. Russian forces still haven't taken the huge, as-of-style steel plant, the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. Another ultimatum to surrender has been ignored by Ukrainian Marines. Their commander said they would fight on, despite 500 of his soldiers being wounded. Civilians were also sheltering with them, he said. Russia has agreed safe routes to get 6,000 women, children and elderly people out of the city, but tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped there. Elsewhere on the 500-kilometer long eastern front fighting has continued with Russia, saying it hit 1,000 targets in Ukraine. Russia is trying to capture the eastern Dombas region in a new offensive, but UK intelligence says Ukrainian forces have fought off several attacks. The COVID booster rate has stalled. Nearly 1 million people have had two doses, but haven't got a third. Only 71% of eligible people are boosted compared to 95% double-vaxed. A GP in Auckland, Matere Harwood, says the lower uptake is because of a mix of vaccine fatigue, fair of side effects and the booster not being widely mandated. Dr Harwood says others have recently had COVID and think they don't need a vaccine anymore. The National Party says the government must ask itself why Solomon Islands looked past its traditional allies to China for a security deal. Solomon Islands has signed a security agreement with Beijing despite expressed concern from New Zealand, Australia and the United States. National's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Jerry Brownlee, says the development is a diplomatic failure. There does have to be a question asked about why has that relationship broken down to a point where a Commonwealth country can look well outside its natural friends for a security arrangement. look well outside its natural friends for a security arrangement. Jerry Brownlee says New Zealand should consider extending its existing peacekeeping deployment in Solomon Islands. Insect numbers have plunged by half in some parts of the world due to climate change and intensive agriculture. British researchers say the threat to insects must be acknowledged before some species are lost forever. They say preserving habitat for nature could help ensure vital insects thrive. The lead researcher Dr Charlie Arthwaite says losing insect populations could be harmful not only to the natural environment but to human health and food security, particularly with the loss of pollinators. At least five storms in the past year in Tairafati have shuts off roads and cut-off communities. The area, which includes Gisbon and the East Cape, has been hit by serious storms once a month for the past three months. Residents say flood damage is becoming more common. The government says there's mitigation work underway, such as resource management and freshwater reforms. It's also approved more than $13 million to improve State Highway 35. A Manawatu councillor is furious. A bridge connecting to central North Island regions isn't yet open. Construction of the new Mangaweka Bridge over the Rangateke River finished in February, and all that remains to do is alignment work at each end. Councillor Andrew Quarry says that should have happened weeks ago. This had the opportunity of being a really good, good news story. It was a bridge that was designed and built to service an area. It was going to be opened six months earlier than planned, and instead of being a good news story, it's become a laughing stock, an absolute joke. Andrew Quarry says heavy vehicles have to use a difficult alternative route, and the bridge is scheduled to open in June. To sport now, and tomorrow night's Super Rugby Pacific match between Moines, the Pacifica and the Western Force, has been postponed due to positive COVID cases in the force. The game was part of this weekend's Super Round with all teams playing in Melbourne, but a large contingent of the force squad is unavailable. It's the fourth game, while the Pacifica have had to post-ball, have had postponed this season. The Stars beat the tactics 56-48 in their ANZ netball match in Auckland last night. The win was the star's third over the Canterbury-based team this season and extends the gap between the fourth-placed Aucklanders and the fifth-placed tactics. And Wimbledon has barred Russian and Belarusian players from this year's Grand Slam due to the invasion of Ukraine, becoming the first tennis tournament to ban individual competitors from the two countries. The decision means Grand Slam due to the invasion of Ukraine, becoming the first tennis tournament to ban individual competitors from the two countries. The decision means Grand Slam champions Russia's Danil Medvedev and Belarusian, Victoria, Azerenka, will not be able to participate in the Grass Court Major, which starts in June. And that's the news.

In Ukraine, the escalating conflict in the east of the country has many analysts saying the outcome the war will hinge on how much military assistance NATO can provide to Ukraine's forces. The BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner has more. This conflict has really now evolved into a war on two fronts. On the big strategic front, Russia is firing a lot of missiles at targets right across Ukraine, even as far west as Lviv, close to the Polish border. It's aiming to hit things like storage depots, training bases, railways. The whole idea is to degrade Ukraine's ability to sustain its war effort. Most of the fighting on the ground, though, is taking place in the east of the country, the Dombas. And this is where much of Ukraine's army is dug in, and it's here that the decisive battles of this war will be fought, but they could go on a long time. Well, Ukraine's forces have got both advantages and disadvantages. Playing against them is the sheer weight of Russian forces ranged against them, particularly artillery. Russia relies heavily on artillery strikes to basically batter down enemy positions before rolling in with tanks and infantry. But these are experienced Ukrainian forces, and they are equipped with the very latest state-of-the-art NATO-supplied missiles, something that really annoys President Putin. Ukraine's morale is remarkably high, given the damage their country has suffered. But that's partly due to the charisma of their president, Volodymya Zelensky, who has been able to galvanize pretty much the whole country behind him. Now, the big fear in Western circles is that if President Putin doesn't get his own way here, there is a risk, and the CIA has said this, that in desperation he could be tempted to lash out with something like a tactical nuclear warhead. That's an artillery shell or a small missile that would set off a nuclear explosion. The first time one has been used in anger since 1945. BBC security correspondent, Frank Gardner there. With the latest from the country's east, is BBC correspondent Catherine Biaronga. The front line is getting closer to Nova Silevka, where 20 miles from the heaviest fighting. But the loud thuds of artillery fire can still be heard. The village was hit by heavy shelling. One woman was killed after picking up one of the cluster bombs that didn't explode. A bomb disposal squad has been called in to clear the area. Andrew Halisavich is the head of the unit. He says a lot more people need their help. The enemy has started deploying these munitions in large numbers, and quite a few of them failed to function in certain conditions. Out of a population of 300 people, there are only a handful left. The rest have fled the village. Mikhailovic has stayed and witnessed the explosion. It happened at night. It started with three massive explosions. At 6 a.m. I got up to work and saw people running around. I saw bomblets covering the small farms. I told people not to go there. Russia has now confirmed that its new offensive has begun, the long-awaited all-out assault on eastern Ukraine, unleashing thousands of troops and heavy weaponry. A campaign to seize the Dombas region, which includes the separatist areas of Lohansk and Donetsk, and to salvage some sort of victory after retreat and significant losses in the north. In the south, in Mariupol, a few Ukrainian forces refused to let the city fall, holding out in an iron and steel plant. Today, Russian special forces began storming buildings nearby. This war continues to escalate, but a Russian victory is far from certain in Ukraine. That was the BBC's Catherine Bihara Hunga. It is 12 minutes past six. To China now, the eastern city of Tangshun has followed Shanghai into a COVID-19 lockdown. Now, the city has nearly 8 million people. It will undergo tight restrictions. And this is despite reporting just 29 positive cases. The BBC's Stephen MacDonald reports from neighbouring Beijing. Tangshan's just one of the many cities currently locked down. I mean, there are dozens of towns and cities locked down in China at the moment. You can imagine the impact on the economy here, on people's livelihoods, on the morale of the country. Tungshan, apart from having nearly 8 million people, is a steel city. They've been in lockdown about a month ago and they've gone back into lockdown. Again, you know, that would be very bad news for the people who live there. And in Shanghai, this city of 25 million people, the authorities really are struggling to manage it still. I mean, at times it's been completely chaotic. There are signs now that residents of that city are not going along with what the government says. They're not coming downstairs to have their tests as they're supposed to do because they're worried, firstly, that they'll catch COVID. And secondly, if they do catch COVID, they might be forced to go to one of these centralized isolation facilities where they'll be sleeping on camp beds in huge hangars next to people who may be much more sick than they are. And this includes very old people, frail, elderly, people who are weak, people who have other sicknesses are being made to go to these squalid isolation facilities. And it all seems like it's to be part of this unwielding commitment to zero COVID that the government here is sort of rolling out in a mantra type fashion and it's unable to shift policy. It's had this great policy that worked for so long with no vaccines, but it just doesn't seem to fit with the Omicron variant and with people who are increasingly vaccinated. And that is the BBC Stephen MacDonald reporting from Beijing. It is coming up to quarter past six. From next month, recreational fishes will face daily catch limits on all types of fin fish. There are more than a thousand species in Atearoa, but only 43 of these have been subject to limits. Recreational fisher, Stuart. Hill joins us now. Kiyo de Stuart? Oh, good morning, Marnie. What do you think about these limits? Oh, I think it's fantastic. It's long overdue for a long time. You know, people have been able to catch fish that sit outside the current limits and endless numbers. For our listeners, who may not be versed in fishing, Stuart, tell us what types of fish these are that are being caught and that will be subject to these limits. An example is pig maumour, which has been caught in large numbers, obviously, east coast of the Coromandel, when I say large numbers in hundreds. And it's been previously there's been no limits on those, so you're just decimating a reef population of slow-growing fish. Why do you think it's taken so long to put these restrictions in place? I'm not too sure. I mean, one of the things has been, it's often been pushed back from recreational fishes compared to commercial fishery when they see that the likes of snapper have been, day due as being unfairly punished compared to the commercial take. So in some cases the recreational fishers have been saying, you know, why shouldn't we be able to do this? But on the other hand, the current take is enough that you can go home with a feed and more than enough, you know, more than a feed for your family with just seven snapper and three kingfish and up to 20 other fin fish. So to have the ability to take ends numbers of any fish that sit outside the current quota is to me as short-sighted and foolish. Yeah, that sounds like a good feed to me, Stuart. In terms of the minister has said that there has been a change in what people now catch and eat, how have you seen that change just in recent years? I've seen that there have been, as I say, off the east coast of the Corramental, but in other areas with the country as well. People have been taking endless numbers of fish. And you've got to think that a seventh snap or that's fishing off the east coast of Auckland or the Bay of Plenty is more than enough to feed your family and feed your freezer, or 10 off the west coast. And then if you add in those other species like Kauai and kingfish, where you can certainly end up with a lot of weighted fish. Being able to catch all those, the other fish that sit outside that, you've got to think, are those people using it for home use, or is there a black market going on with the like with those other fish? Are these limits going to work, you reckon? Hopefully so, and I think it'll be reliant a little bit on policing at Rams and like and also people being aware, and then the other thing is NPI have got a fantastic scheme where you can dobb in a poacher if you see somebody at a ramp who's got or you see or you know somebody who's taking excessive fish. And most importantly, Stuart, what are the conditions like this day? You're going to be out on the water? This weekend, it should be. The weather's looking pretty good. It looks like we've got a couple of five-not variable days. Awesome. Hey, thank you for your time this morning. That is recreational fisher, Stuart Hill. It is 18 minutes past six. Overseas now, the Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has taken to the stand again overnight to give evidence in his $75 million lawsuit against his ex-wife, Amber Hurd. Heard was being sued for defamation for implying her former husband had abused her in a 2018 opinion piece for the Washington Post. In the article, Ms Heard described herself as a victim of domestic violence. Depp's lawyers say her allegations have made it difficult for Depp to land movie roles. Here is Johnny Depp describing his relationship with his former wife. We would have been talking the night before or arguing the night before, and she would say something there would be these again these demeaning berating insults there would be these these jabs there would be anything to make me feel small and uh and like nothing um so what I thought was I'm going to record the conversation and I told her this I'm going to record I'm going to get my phone and I'm going to record our conversation because I want you to hear what you've said to me tomorrow. Because she would deny having said those things. What are you talking about? You know, it was surreal. She had completely denied things. She said directly to my face in a heated and volatile way. And she denied it. So I went to and I said, I'm going to record us. And I did. And we recorded the conversation. Johnny Depp there. That testimony is continuing. It is now 20 minutes past six. Prostate cancer is serious, but it's not always life-threatening. Some tumours grow too slowly to ever cause any problems and can safely be left alone, monitored rather than treated. But there is a more aggressive type of prostate cancer, which scientists in the UK say they think they've found a way to detect through specific types of bacteria in urine. Dr Rachel Hurst from the University of East Anglia says it could lead to more options for treatment. We wanted to develop a test to distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer early and what we found is that there is a group of five bacteria that when they're detected are associated with high-grade prostate cancer and also aggressive prostate cancer. We've also identified four brand-new novel species of bacteria in the samples. So what this enables us to do now is design tests, pick up these particular bacteria in patient samples, and then this could then aid treatment plan earlier. So say, for example, if a gentleman's diagnosed with prostate cancer, they may, depending on the grade of cancer, they may enter a watchful waiting, where the cancer's just watched over several years, whereas if we've got a test there that we can distinguish between aggressive cancer early, then those patients could start the treatment path earlier. The detection method will not only help identify prostate cancer, but should also reduce the relatively high number of false positive diagnoses associated with the illness. We've got two tests, actually. We've got the prostate urine risk score test as well. So this test is a urine test and this will aid in being able to detect whether a cancer's likely to progress or not but also with this new study now with these five bacteria and the novel bacteria that we've identified combining that with the test as well will really aid that decision plan in the future for patients we hope. That was Dr Rachel Hurst there speaking to the BBC. It is 22 minutes past six. And now to what the top news websites around the world are running. Let's start with our mates over in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese have clashed in a fiery debate over China's expansion into the Pacific as the Prime Minister attacked his opponent's history on asylum seeker, both turnbacks and the Labour leader fought back on the NDIS, a fiery debate there. Let's go over to the other side of the world to the BBC live blogs there, anguish for thousands trapped in Maripol as evacuation stalls. Obviously lots on the Wimbledon ban for Russian and Belarusian players. We'll be speaking to our sports team about that soon. And over to the Guardian. Again, Russia-Ukraine war live blogs. Russia demands Maripo surrender as small convoy of civilians reported to have left besieged city and Ki America to America, the New York Times. Again, live blogs there on Ukraine, Rattling Sabaputin announces test of long-range missile, as well as the latest on Julian Assange, and the ruling for calling for him to be extradited. It is 23 minutes past six, and our main stories on Money Report today. Inflation figures released later this morning will show the biggest annual rise in more than 30 years. The Taranaki community is calling for more information about the police shooting of Chaos Price, release later this morning will show the biggest annual rise in more than 30 years. The Taranaki community is calling for more information about the police shooting of chaos price as authorities remain tight-lipped. And there's been a desperate plea from Ukraine's military to extract soldiers and civilians trapped in a Maripo steelwork, saying they're facing their last days. But our business editor, Giles Beckford, is in with our business news. Tena queer, Giles, what's happening in the markets? Geri, Amani. First of all, Wall Street, it's a bit of a mix showing. Good earnings for the likes of IBM are bolstering mainstream stocks. But technology is being dragged lower because of Netflix's poor result. It lost subscribers for the first time in a decade. Shares are currently down about 36% for Netflix, and that's flowed onto other streaming services and technology companies. So the Dow Jones Industrial average currently up about 0.9%. The S&P 500 is just under a quarter of a percent higher. It's a NASDAQ that's suffering down 0.9%. Our own top 50 index had a winning away, gaining 130 points. It was about 1.1 percent, sitting just below the 12,000 level. And quite a full-up for the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar overnight, strongly higher as US wholesale interest rates have fallen, dragging the green back with it. So Kiwi trading at 68 US cents and 91.2 Australian. And what's in your main bulletin there, Giles? Well, the supermarket giant foodstuffs North Island, pack and save new world owners, says it's changing its ways and behaviour to promote competition and it's inviting everybody to see how with a new website. The grape harvest looks like it's been pretty good and that means a better wine production season. We'll see how good it might be. And high building costs taking a toll on housing projects with the question being has the search in building consents reached its peak? That and the latest from financial markets, just after 10 to 7. Kiyore, Jowz. See you soon. Now time for the rural news with Susan Murray in Krikiridoa Hamilton. Kiyo-da, Susan, and dear numbers are swelling in an East Coast forest. Morena, Marni, a recreational hunter who recently returned from a multi-day trip in the Rokumara Forest Park, says that deer numbers are soaring and a planned cull is needed. Lance Rickard says the deer are causing huge environmental damage chewing through the bush. When we were out, we just saw so many hinds, eh? It was just, I've never seen it like that. So, it must probably has to be something a bit stronger to be done about all of that. Do you think that the DIA numbers have exploded in the past couple of years with the hunting not being allowed to happen? Yeah, I think the restrictions on everybody. It's most probably allowed that to happen. But numbers have been building for ages, say. So, you know, there's been a lot of discussion going over in the last couple of years. So something has got to be done anyway. Otherwise, there's just so much damage in our native areas, though. Lance Rickard said that it would be up to the Department of Conservation to come up with a control plan. And Doc is aware of the problem, and it says that the damage that the deer... It is aware of the damage that the deer are causing to the forest. A spokesperson says deer control has taken place in a 30,000 hectare area of the park over the past seven years. And alongside this, the Rokumara Paymonga Restoration Project, which is a partnership between Gauti Poro, Tefanau, Apanui and the Crown, is undertaking deer and goat control across 100,000 hectares of the park. And a call out, sorry, and a call out has gone Tonga needs tractors, is that right? It certainly does, Marni. And the hunt is now on for old tractors and other farm equipment that can be sent to Tonga following their December devastating volcanic eruption there. Now, New Zealand horticulture growers set up a grower relief fund 16 months ago to help fellow orchards in New Zealand after devastating weather events. But its chair Julian Rain says that they're keen to extend assistance to Pacific Islands. And he says the eruption in Tonga, it wiped out vegetable crops. So it's an ideal time to provide some longer term support by supplying equipment, which will help farmers to prepare land and to replant. He said there's not a lot of mechanisation on some Tongan farms. So he says they'll use money from this Grower Relief Fund to get tractors, which are easy to service with a spanner. And I guess if you're able, you could also donate a tractor or agricultural equipment. Definitely sort of cultivation-type gear, small to medium-sized tractors because the plots are quite small. And we would vet it so that the equipment is similar, so we don't want to send up sort of 10 orphan tractors. We would like to get some that are roughly the same so that there's consistency for parts and filters and things like that. When do you hope to be able to send a ship load up? We're thinking this is kind of like a winter, early spring project. And you don't think you'll have a problem finding a ship that will go there. There's certainly ships are still going. Unfortunately, a bit of them are later, a few of them are late at the moment, but we're hoping that MPI will assist us in some of the freight. So it's a joint grower and government project. Julian Rain says that they'll also fill gaps in the container with other donations of hand-operated equipment. And this grower relief fund will look to do similar things for Vanuatu and Samoa. We have a lot of RSE workers from those countries and New Zealand working on our New Zealand orchards and vineyards, and Julian Rain says that it really is time for a bit of grower payback. Kiorna, Susan, and do you have a tractor that you can donate? Yeah, well, I was thinking about it, Marnie, and I reckon my husband's 1958 Fergie tractor would be pretty good. It does go, it doesn't need a computer to alter the clutch or anything like that, the way the modern ones do, you know, a spanner in a few kind words. If you kind words, say that does it, I do that to my own car sometimes going up some rough hills. Oh, hey, thank you, Susan. That's Susan Murray, with our rural news. It is. Hapa 6. And let's have a look at your weather at Hapa 6 this morning on morning report. Well, there's rain or showers for most across the Motu today, though it'll be fine for Fanganui, Manawatu and Hawks Bay. Auckland, at least warm temperatures are still rolling on. Auckland 23, Tauranga 22, Hamilton 24, even Wellington 20 degrees. Christchurch is 26 degrees today. Amazing. And in Eden 21, the warmest place at the moment is Banks Peninsula with a high already of 22.5. And the coldest place is Twissel at just 8.2 degrees. I love that emphasis on. Even Wellington is just in the 20s. People get annoyed about that, sorry. And too much adoration there for your hometown, Corrin, Christchurch. Anyway, coming up before 7-on morning report, the latest inflation figures will be released later this morning. We speak with economist Finn Robinson. The UN Secretary-General is warned if he does not step up efforts to mediate peace in Ukraine, the UN could be doomed. And in Australia, the first debate has taken place between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese. But it's time now for the news with Anna Thomas. Inflation is set to hit a 30-year high today. Figures out today are expected to show prices rose by about 7% in the last 12 months. At the end of last year, annual inflation hit 5.9% well beyond the reserve bank's target of between 1 and 3. It boosted the official cash rate to 1.5% last week in an effort to curb demand. The figures will be released at about 11 o'clock. Ukraine is accusing Russia of breaching the latest attempted ceasefire in the city of Maripo. It was hoped 6,000 civilians could escape, but only a small bus convoy has left. The BBC's Anne Foster reports meanwhile that Ukraine's defenders in a giant steelworks have made a last video plea for help. Russia has offered these soldiers several opportunities to surrender and they haven't taken it. And in fact, in this video, they appeal to the international community, to world leaders, to, they describe it as extract them from that steel plant, from Mariupol, and take them to a third-party country. So they obviously don't believe the assurances that Russia is giving that if they do surrender, that they will be treated under the Geneva Convention and they will escape with their lives. Elsewhere on the 500-kilometer long eastern front fighting has continued. Russia is trying to capture the eastern Donbass region in a new offensive, but UK intelligence says Ukrainian forces have fought off several attacks. An epidemiologist thinks the COVID booster vaccine rollout has reached its high point. Ministry of Health figures show booster coverage is actually declining, with more people becoming eligible each day than are actually getting it. The national rates dropped from 73 to 71% in the last month. Auckland University Professor Rod Jackson says until something major changes, most people who want to get it now have done so. China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific is sure to feature in conversation between the Prime Minister and her Japanese counterpart today. Jacinda Ardena arrived in Tokyo overnight, starting the second leg of her international trade mission. Solomon Islands has signed a security agreement with Beijing, despite expressed concern from New Zealand, Australia and the United States. The National Party says the government must ask itself why Solomon Islands looked past its traditional allies to China for a security deal. National's Foreign Affairs spokesperson Jerry Brownley says the development is a diplomatic failure. He says New Zealand should consider extending its existing peacekeeping deployment in Solomon Islands, given growing volatility in the region. A resident of the remote Waipiro Bay in Taarafi says he's watching the land around him go underwater over time. Tairafti has been hit by serious storms once a month for the past three months. The most serious this year has been in March. Len Walker says he's seen it change from when he was a child. The foreshore was actually probably another 25, 30 metres out to sea. So there was a grass area out there that's all gone now. And so it's not just the flooding and all that. It's also to do with our tides. There's all sorts of stuff going on there that has taken away the land. The government says there is mitigation work underway, such as resource management and freshwater reforms. And that's the news. Country life this week's in the far north having a sip of homegrown coffee. This guy said, I've never been so excited to spend six times more than ever spent on coffee before. It's a bargain at about $460 a kilogram. Put it like this. If you were to buy this varietal produced from New Caledonia or the Reunion Islands, from a roastery in Paris or Tokyo, you would pay anywhere between $600 and $1,000 per kje. Country life Friday nights at 9 and Saturday mornings after the 7 o'clock news on RNZ National. And now the MetService regional forecast first the situation and northerly flow affects most of New Zealand as a trough approaches from the Tasman Sea. Now the trough moves east across the South Island on Thursday and the North Island on Friday, followed by a ridge of high pressure. On Sunday, a front moves north, followed by south-westerlies. Looking at the regional forecast until midnight tonight, Northland, Auckland, Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of plenty Rotorua and Taupo, cloudy, a few showers, more frequent from the afternoon, and possibly heavy from Northland to northern Coramandal, northeasterlies. Waikato, Waitomo, Taumaranui and Taranaki, cloudy periods and a few showers mainly about Taranaki. Shows more widespread from the evening, possibly heavy in thundery in Taranaki. Tajape, Huanganui and Mano too, cloudy periods. A few showers developing in northern Tahepe in the afternoon, northerlees. Gisbon, Hawks Bay and Widerapa, including the Tarado district. Mainly fine, but cloudy with a few showers north of Ruatoria, and rain in southern wider upper tonight, northerlees. Ordu Fenua, Kapiti coast and Wellington, mostly cloudy. A few showers developing in the afternoon, turning to rain with possibly heavy falls at night. Northeerlees, rising to gale gusting 90 kilometres an hour and exposed parts of Wellington during the morning. Malbra except the Kauara coasts, also Nelson, Buller, Westland and Fjordland. Rain with heavy falls in possible thunderstorms, localised downpours of possible in the Westland ranges this morning, northerly, changing southerly from late in the evening. The Kakaura coast in Canterbury, cloudy, a period of light rain spreading north in the morning in the afternoon, widespread heavier rain developing south of Ashburton in the evening as northerlyse changed southwesterly. Otago and Southland rain, clearing Ashburton in the evening as northerlease changed southwesterly. Otago and Southland rain clearing for a time in the morning, then returning in the afternoon, some heavy falls possible in the morning and from evening, northerlees changing southwesterly in the afternoon or evening. For the Chatham Islands, cloudy periods with northerlees and the outlook for all of New Zealand until midnight tomorrow. Rain or showers for most heavy at first in the Bay of Plenty, easing to a few showers, then clearing later, except the southwestern, South Island in Gisbon. For the Chatham Islands, rain developing and northern east rising to gale. It is 23 minutes to seven. Kiora, thank you, Anna. Let's talk sport now with Barry Guy. Good morning, Barry. Hi. Now, Wimbledon. Tennis, they're banning the Russians and the Bala Russians. Explain to me how this works. So it's Wimbledon doing it, not the Tennis Federation. That's right. Yes, the Grand Slam tournaments are separate to the ATP and WTA tours, and they more or less run themselves. And they have decided, I'm not surprised perhaps that it's Wimbledon with Britain's government stance on the war in Ukraine and the support giving to Ukraine and anti-Russian and Belarusian. So perhaps there has been a little bit of influence there as far as Wimbledon is concerned. So it means the likes of world number two means player Daniel Medvedev from Russia and the Belarusian Victoria Azarenka won't be able to compete there. There's about a half a dozen Russian and Belarusian tennis players in the top 20 in the world that will be missing. Russia, of course, says that it's going to be the tournament that misses out because they're now going to be playing without some of their stars. But as I say, I'm not particularly surprised that Britain is the first one to do this. Well, it raises the question. Why won't the French do it as well? Well, the French one's coming up next, yes, that's right. But who knows what Macron starts and this whole thing. So let's go back to the Olympics because the Olympics had banned the Russians from going under their flag and had to call themselves, what do they call them? The Olympic Committee of Russia or something or rather. That's right. Why not do that? Well, they could do that, but in my opinion that's a bit soft really. You're allowing someone from a country to compete. You know, you might not be able to wave the Russian flag around, but you're still a Russian or a Belarusian, and you're still being able to compete. I mean, it's just a, it's just something with words, you know, but it's no action, so to speak. And the likes of Mepvedev, who's number two, pushing number one in the world, they have to accept that this is the, they need to just accept the government is in an illegal war and that they have to... That's right, and the whole thing about not mixing politics and sport, I mean, that's what we had, you know, 30, 40 years ago here in particular. The ATP, of course, it says they're upset by the unilateral decision. It's unfair and potentially setting a damaging precedent for the game. But again, I think that, you know, when you've got a war in a country, illegal entering, that's a bit unprecedented as well, isn't it? Yeah. So good on them. I think we'll just have to wait and see whether some of the other sporting come out. Surely Australia will too eventually. I mean, the Australian open, that's a wee way away. They don't have to worry about it so right now. But you'd think given to their starts, I mean surely. Well, is Scobo still going to be in charge over there? We'll have to wait and see. Very good. Thank you very much, Barry Guy. With your sports chat this morning, it is 20 minutes to 7. Now, the latest inflation figures will be released later this morning. And it is widely expected to have hit a 30-year high of as much as 7.4%. Now, I spoke to A&Z economist Finn Robinson a short time ago, and he says, while this is likely to be the peak, high rates of inflation will be around, will be around, for at least another year. We're expecting to see FAPI inflation print at 7.4%, which would be the highest since 1990 in the aftermath of 1989 GST. So, is this the peak, or do you expect it to be continuing? I mean, are inflation expectations, what people think it will be entrenched now? We're cautiously optimistic that this was the peak. The key reason for that really is that we saw the Omiconeway peak in New Zealand in Q1, and we also saw the huge impact of the war in Ukraine, not just in the transplants of life, but we also saw huge commodity prices as well. So touch words, we won't see a repeat of that kind of volatility, and so that's why we're optimisticistically that Q1 was hopefully to be. So uncertainty is really high and we have consistently been surprised by the strength and inflation. So we're not out of the woods yet and the Reserve Bank still has work to do to get a hold of inflation. Yeah, you mention that work. So they're aggressively tightening now at 50 basis point jumps is likely to be more. How quickly do you expect that to bring inflation back to the target range that the bank has of, what, around 2%? So we're expecting that they'll hike the OCR on the 50 basis point of May and then keep going throughout this year. But because inflation has become pretty entrenched, especially in the domestic economy, we think it might actually take quite a while for them to bring inflation back down. So we're sort of looking more at sort of 2024 before inflation is constantly back to the 2% target. So another year or so of people having to endure price hikes of what, five or six percent a year, is there anything that the government can do to try and make that come down faster? Well, it is a challenging situation for the government because on the one hand, the economy is clearly quite overheated, but at the same time, there are areas of the economy which are still really suffering. You know, because of the tourism industry, they've gone through two summers without international visitors. So there's certainly a role for targeted system policies to help out those sectors. And at the end of the day, the Reserve Bank's task with getting inflation under control and the traditional inflation fighting tool is higher interest rates. And as unpleasant as that medicine is, as the Reserve Bank administers, it is better than letting inflation is going to be viral. Do you expect wages to jump to meet this high inflation that we're going to hit in Q1, as you say, of around 7.4%. Would you expect wages to be up around the 5, 6% mark as a result? So we do expect to see wages accelerate over 2022. They have taken a bit longer to adjust, possibly just reflecting that people have to go through annual wage reviews and that kind of thing. But yeah, we do expect to see hourly earnings growth accelerate for somewhere around 5% over this year. And that will mean that there will be a period where inflation is still stronger than earnings growth, but then wages should catch up. And then people will certainly start to feel like they're making progress again. But that's sort of more of an early 2023 story in our current forecast. I mean, food prices are a big factor for households in the inflation story. Is there any hope of them coming down or anything that can be done to try and alleviate those issues or are they more related to energy and supply constraints? Yes, so the recent increases that we're seeing are definitely correlated with the global surge in food prices that we're seeing and one reason for that is that the Ukraine, for example, is called the breadbasket of Europe. They're a key food producer. But not only do you have really strong global demand, you've got shipping disruptions, but you've also got this extra disruptions from the war in Ukraine. And so we have seen global food prices there, and it's probably going to come through into New Zealand food prices even more over the next month or so over the middle of this year. And really, it's something we're just going to have to ride out. So do you think inflation may stay up around, what, levels above 5 or 6% for the whole of this year? That's been our forecast at the moment. One reason for that is simply because of how tight the labour market is. We do expect to see quite a lot of inflation coming out of there because we're having to pay a lot more for their workers over this year. Well, COVID is still around, impact productivity, and so they have to pass on the higher wage bill in the form of high prices. So we think that will see inflation will remain pretty strong over this year. But eventually we think that the Reserve Bank will get traction on inflation, and especially given how quickly they're raising interest rates now. So over the next couple years, we should still see inflation moderate back towards their target. But will it also create a recession? Will the housing market obviously come off the boil so much that people stop spending? Confidence is affected and you see a recession? It's definitely a risk in central bank has a history of causing hard landings to the economy. But with the labour market being so tight, you know, we, we've got a record low unemployment rate of 3.2%. We think it'll fall a little bit further this year. We think that'll provide a pretty strong baseline for households to get through this relatively unscathed. And that is A&Z economist Finn Robinson. They're talking about the inflation data that is due out later today, later this morning, expected to be as high as 7.4%. It is now quarter to seven. Gohuri, we're to America. Former UN officials have warned the Secretary-General that if he does not step up efforts to mediate peace in Ukraine, the UN could be doomed. In their letter to Antonio Gutierrez, the group of 200 say he should be prepared to take personal risks to de-escalate conflict and support Ukraine. They emphasise that Russia's war is testing the rationale of the UN, and if Gutierrez does not take more of a lead in peacemaking efforts, the UN runs the risk of becoming irrelevant. Our UN correspondent Sarah Walton joins us now from New York. Hello, Sarah. How, joins us now from New York. Hello, Sarah. How significant is this letter? Well, pretty significant, because actually I can start by giving you a little bit of breaking news on this. In the last couple of hours, it's been confirmed by the UN that the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has written to the authorities of Ukraine and Russia asking to meet with President Zelensky and President Putin in their home countries. Now, the UN insists that this was not prompted by this letter that it's been in the plans for a while, but it is fair to say. I think this letter is significant, given the number of people that signed it, and the seniority of some of the names on there. You know, these are under-Secary Gener's or former deputies to the current Secretary-General and previous Secretary-General's as well. As you were saying, they want him to play a bigger role. And so they're getting some of what they want here. What they were suggesting is that he should visit conflict zones. He should be holding discussions himself with the opposing sides. And even potentially moving his office temporarily to Europe to be nearer to where the negotiations are happening. And they say this is important because the very existence of the UN is under threats. Now, the UN was established just after World War II to avoid war. And yet now, at the moment, we have a major member of the UN, Russia, invading another member state, which is illegal and a breach of the UN charter, the founding documents of the UN. And so far, the UN has been powerless to stop the fighting. And that's because Russia is such a senior member. It is a permanent member of the Security Council. And that means it has the power to veto decisions about its actions that the UN takes. In terms of Guterres writing to Ukraine and Russia to facilitate these peace talks, when will we know more about whether or not they will go ahead? So the UN says they are taking this a step at a time. The letters have just been presented to the permanent missions of Ukraine and Russia here at the UN in New York. So they're waiting to get a response. We do know that there has been work going on behind the scenes. The Secretary General appointed one of his under-Secary generals, Martin Griffiths, who covers humanitarian affairs, to actually reach out to Ukraine and Russia to try and get them to talk about potentially introducing under Secretary-General's Martin Griffiths, who covers humanitarian affairs, to actually reach out to Ukraine and Russia to try and get them to talk about potentially introducing humanitarian ceasefires. So that pauses in fighting to allow civilians to flee and also for aid convoys to get into the region. Martin Griffith actually went to Moscow and to Kiev a week before last. He said that Ukraine has responded positively to most of the proposals. The UN has put forward for that. However, they are yet to get a response from Russia. And Martin Griffith said that he felt that at the moment, that humanitarian ceasefire simply weren't a priority for Russia at the moment. So the signs coming from Ukraine have been positive, less positive coming from Russia. There's no signs of anything sewing down, though, in Ukraine at the moment. No, we're hearing reports of increased activity, military activity in the eastern area, particularly the UN says that it is very concerned about the fighting happening there. The Secretary General himself says that the concentration of firepower and forces in that eastern area, so that, you know, the areas around Maripol, for example, is leading to a conflict that is even more bloody than has been seen in the fighting in Ukraine up until this point. The UN is on the ground there. They have aid workers in the country. They recently reopened their office in Kyiv. They have been getting some aid convoys into parts of the country that have been, you know, cut off since the start of the war recently. But they say that their ability to reach people is still being hampered by the fighting, and it is nowhere near a big enough response at the moment. They say there are about 12 million people in Ukraine who are in need of humanitarian aid, but they expect that number to go up to nearer 16 million in the coming days and weeks, and that would be 40% of the current population of Ukraine. Thanks for that update. That is our UN correspondent speaking to us from New York, Sarah Walton. It is nine minutes to seven. Let's take a look at your morning newspapers. $10,000 stolen from dead pensioner is the headline on the New Zealand Herald, which has a story on the banking ombudsman, criticizing the ANZ for allowing nearly $10,000 to be drained from an elderly woman's account by alleged fraudsters in the days after her death. In the Weakato Times, they have a story on rumbles at Ruapu, and we'll have more on that later. The Dom Post and the press are both leading with fresh inflation figures set to come out today. And finally, on the front page of the Otago Daily Times, health officials are warning the pandemic is not done with Otago in Southland as record admissions to hospital and near record numbers of new cases continue in the south. Some traffic news now on the West Coast, Arthur's Pass, is closed at Rock Shelter. This is due to a truck breakdown. Waka Kutahi is asking motorists to delay travel there if you're going through the pass. It is now coming up to what, eight minutes to seven. That is time to go to business with Giles Beckford. Thank you, Corin, Atomari Atato. In the business news this morning, supermarket giant touts its competition commitment. Is the building boom set to turn and the latest from the financial markets. Supermarket Giant Food Stuffs North Island wants the public to check how it's progressing in improving competition in the grocery sector, as recommended by the Commerce Commission's recent market study. Changes recommended by the competition watchdog included freeing up land for new stores, new entrants, improving access to wholesale distribution and a code of conduct for the sector. Foodstuffs, whose brands include New World and Pack and Save, has set up an online dashboard with quarterly updates so the public can see its progress. Chief Executive Keith Chris Quinn says it wants to be accountable regardless of any further action the government may or may not take following the study. The things we're getting on with, the ones we want to do first of the ones that will make the biggest difference for our customers. So working on simplification of our pricing promotion so that our customers can see a ticket on a shelf and that what it says it is makes sense to them and that they can make their shopping decisions based on that. Chris Quinn says works also started on removing covenants on land it has sold, ensuring that there aren't any constraints if another operator decides to enter the market. Of course, final decisions on that supermarket's inquiry are in the hands of the government. The property analyst says residential building consents may have peaked the spiraling construction cost price some people out of the market. Report from property research firm CoreLogic shows building costs rose by a record 2.4% in the three months ended March, and that took the annual increase to more than 7%. Price increases have been blamed on supply and skill shortages in particular at the time when residential building consents hit a record high of more than 49,000 in the year ended February. Call Logic's chief economist Kelvin Kelvin Davidson, says he expects consent to fall from here on in. Costs have got fairly high. You've also got lending restraint, so it's harder to get a loan to finance a new build now. So I think we're probably pretty close to that point. We've seen new dwelling consent stay fairly high, but I just get feeling we're pretty close to that turning point, and some people will pull back. But there's already been so many improved that the industry itself might not be too worried. They might just be planning on a fair bit of work for a while yet. Calvin Davidson says reduced consent and fewer new builds coming to the market generally underpins the value of the existing housing stock. The 2022 grape harvest looks to have rebounded from the shock of last year, and that's allowing bigger production and winemakers to refill their sellers after stocks were depleted last year. The 2021 harvest was 19% down on the year before that because of poor weather and it forced wineries to use their reserves to meet market demand. But reports are coming through from some makers of a much better year. The Stock Exchange listed company Foley Wines reporting its 20-22 harvest is likely to be two-thirds up on the year before. New Zealand wine growers' chief executive Philip Gregan says early feedback points to a recovery for the industry. The vintage is sort of back to normal after a very small crop last year. That's going to please a lot of our wineries because I've certainly been plagued by shortage at the moment. On the other hand, COVID-19 and labour shortages presented fairly unique challenges this year, but at the end of the day, we seem to have got through. Philip Grigin says the gradual reopening of borders should lead to more on-premise sales for wineries. Let's have a look at financial markets now as we come up to three minutes to seven. On Wall Street, it's a mixed showing. Good earnings for the likes of IBM are bolstering mainstream stocks, but technology stocks are being dragged lower because of the streaming company Netflix showing good earnings for the likes of IBM are bolstering mainstream stocks, but technology stocks are being dragged lower because of the streaming company Netflix poor result. It lost subscribers for the first time in a decade. It's talking of adverts and banning sharing of streaming licenses. It shares down 36% with about an hour or so of trading to go. So overall the market, the Dow Jones Industrial average is about half a percent higher, off its peak. The S&P 500 has just turned negative in the past 15 minutes. It's a quarter of a percent lower, and the drop in the NASDAQ is worsening. It's 1.4% down. Our own top 50 index gained 130 points yesterday, 1.1%, just sitting below the 12,000 level. New Zealand dollar has been quite a strong lift against the US dollar overnight. 68 US cents. That's on the back of a drop in US bond yields. Kiwi is 91.2 Australia. 52.1 British Pence. 0627 euro. 86.9 Japanese yen. That's close to a seven-year high, of course, and 4.37 yuan. Brinkwood oil, currently down about 40 cents a barrel, $106.80 US. And gold is down $3 to $1,954 US dollars an ounce. And just to remind you, of course, we should mention inflation, as you've been hearing the news, the first quarter numbers will be out this morning at quarter to 11. The market view is for a 2% quarterly rise, although the picks do vary. That would bring an annual rate of 7.1%. Fuel, food, housing will be the main drivers, and that would be the highest annual rate since mid-1990. Of course, we'll bring those details as they happen. That's business for now.

The cost of living hasn't gone unnoticed, with the price of food and fuel a pain point for many people. Last quarter, annual inflation hit just under 6% well over the reserve bank's target of between 1 and 3. It up the ante last week by boosting the official cash rate to 1.5% in an effort to curb demand. Today's consumer price data will give an insight into how widespread inflation is, with economists worried if it has seeped into services and the wider domestic economy, blunt monetary policy might not knock it back as quickly. The figures will be released at about 11 o'clock. Some civilians trapped for weeks in the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol have been able to leave, but officials say far fewer than hoped. Basas had been arranged to evacuate some 6,000 women, children and elderly people. CNN's Matt Rivers reports. They still want to be there and she's old enough, but I know some people who is still young and they still don't want to live. They don't know what's happening in Ukraine. They think that what happening in Mariupo happening everywhere. They don't have full information at all because they don't have internet. The police and Taranaki are being accused of doing little to support the family of a man shot by officers. Chaos Price was killed on Saturday night after he rammed a police car on State Highway 3 between New Plymouth and Waitara. Police have not said if he was carrying a gun and have released few details about what happened. Māori Party co-leader Debbie Nariwapaka has met the family who says they are devastated. She says they're not getting enough information from the police and are being contacted by witnesses who officers have not yet spoken to. Assistant Commissioner Sandra Venables says various investigations are ongoing and police expect they will be able to give further detail in time. An epidemiologist thinks the COVID booster vaccine rollout has reached its high point. Ministry of Health figures show booster coverage is actually declining, with more people becoming eligible each day than are actually getting it. The national rates dropped from 73 to 71% in the last month. Auckland University Professor Rod Jackson says until something major changes, most people who want to get the vaccine have done so. So I think it's going to take another wave or a new variant or vaccine passes to get people to get boosted. And Rod Jackson says the government could consider reintroducing vaccine passes with three doses as a requirement if the winter peak puts hospitals at risk. China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific is sure to feature in conversation between the Prime Minister and her Japanese counterpart today. Jacinda Ardurn arrived in Tokyo overnight, kicking off the second leg of her international trade mission. Our deputy political editor Craig McCulloch is there. The visit comes at a pertinent time, with China announcing it has signed a security deal with the Solomons. New Zealand has called the pact gravely concerning, and Japan has also expressed alarm. Ms Ardern will take part in a half-hour summit with Japan's Fumio Keshida this evening, their first encounter after his election last year. Earlier in the day, she'll take part in two promotional events, one with Zespri and the other with Tokyo, New Zealand. Australia's leaders, Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese, have clashed over policy on border protection in their election campaign debate last night. Mr Albanyese was challenged over why he had not been tougher on turning back the boats with migrants when he was last in government. I was on the National Security Committee. We had established offshore processing just at the, in 2013, when I became Deputy Prime Minister. That was the first step. So you were going to do turnbats? No. No, that's right. Okay. That's right. But why is it, Scott, that you're always looking for a division, not looking for an agreement? No, no, I'm just looking for the accuracy and the truth. Commentators are describing the debate as a draw. Currently, no further debates are scheduled before the election on May the 21st. A local councillor believes the government hasn't invested enough in the main highway from Gisbon to the East Cape. The road has been hit by closures and recent storms. Bill Burdette lives just out of Ruatoria and is the councillor for the Matakawa Waipu Ward. He's told Waka Kota'i the investment isn't up to scratch. I don't mince words. I just hooked in and told them it was unacceptable to have our state highway left in abeyance like it has been when they spend mega millions on all sorts of roads in the cities and outside of Wellington. A government spokesperson says it has approved more than $13 million to improve State Highway 35. A man's been taken to Palmerston North Hospital after an incident in Shannon last night. Hordofeno Mayor Bernie Wondon says he understands a man had turned up at the town's four square with a gunshot wound. Police have yet to release more details. To sport now in the inaugural Super Round of Super Rugby this weekend has been Delta Blow with tomorrow night's match between the Western Force and Moana Pacifica postponed because of a COVID outbreak in the force. All six of the round 10 matches were scheduled to take place in Melbourne over the weekend, but Moana Pacifica have now had their fourth match postponed this season. Meanwhile, New Zealand rugby have told the Super Rugby franchises to watch what they're saying in their post-match interviews. A spade of red cards in recent weeks has led to plenty of discussion, with Highlanders' captain Aaron Smith and Hurricane Skipper, Adisavir, expressing frustration with some refereeing decisions. NZR's Chris Landrum says they have spoken to the teams. What we want to see is feedback around referees and feedback from referees to teams being made through the appropriate channels. And the stars held on to beat the tactics 5648 in their first home game of the ANZ netball season last night in Auckland. And that's the news. How did you get this across the line? Because I understand your management, your boss was not initially came. It still amazes me myself that like this actually happened. It's so huge. And I think I forgot the question along the way, Lisa, just because I'm feeling like I'm going to cry. No, so you were persistent. I'm wondering, Lucia, about the blokes, the men that you work with. Some of them still go, you mention the word period, and they're like, la, la, la, la, la, don't talk to me, don't want to know about it. You know what? Funnily, enough, Lisa, I think it's been a really beautiful thing here. Checkpoint with me, Lisa Owen, 5 o'clock weekday evenings on RNZ National.

The Purore with Morning Report with Corrin Dan and Marnie Dunlop for Leaning in for Susie today. Cash-strapped households won't be surprised when inflation figures released later this morning show the biggest annual rise in more than 30 years. Economists are predicting about a 7% lift for the annual rate, the highest since June 1990. Food, food, fuel and accommodation are expected to be the main drivers. But the numbers will also give us a glimpse into how entrenched the price hikes are and how long they might last. Emma Hatton reports. The cost of living is beginning to bite. All fruits, veggies, definitely, it's not good, yeah, especially when you have a hungry toddler who eats a lot. One paper bag is $100 worth of food, and you don't seem to get a lot for that. Things that have gotten more expensive, and I guess I've noticed myself, like, picking stuff, you know, based on price. And people are doing what they can to stay on top of rising prices. I've had to go to a lot more like frozen vegetables, frozen fruit like bags of that because it's cheaper. Yeah I guess I'm looking for specials more like and trying to yeah keep within the budget. I'm definitely trying to find the cheapest items, store brand stuff, and shopping less. Bit of a bummer, really. Official data out later this morning is expected to show what New Zealanders have been living. An annual inflation rise of about 7%, slightly less than figures coming through from the US and the UK, but a lift on last quarter's annual rate of just under 6%. Shirley McComb is the general manager of Bay Financial Mentors and says belts have been tightening for some time. A whole lot more people are eating vegetarian meals. I think a whole lot more people are trying to pad meals out with rice and pasta, and as the food banks will tell you, a huge amount more people are engaging with food banks just to make it from week to week. She says it's a misnomer that only beneficiaries are seeking out help with a squeezed middle class increasingly in need. Classic is the person, you know, a gentleman maybe in his 50s whose children are up and grown and so they're not getting any support around working for families or family tax credits. They might be earning just a little bit too much for accommodation support. There's really very little to help them, and the prices are just going up and up. Economist Shamabelle Jakob says today's figures from the first three months of the year will give the country a better understanding of how entrenched inflation is throughout the economy. The big thing we're looking for is it spreading out to other services. Is it affecting things like haircuts and all those other things that we do for each other? So if things like labour costs and those prices of services are increasing, that becomes much more sticky and harder to undo. He says global pressures like the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have been the main drivers in pushing up food and fuel, and that's likely to continue over the next few months. He won't take a punt on how long the steep price rises might last. There are just too many external factors. The Reserve Bank stepped up its fight against inflation last week with a 50 basis point lift to the official cash rate, the fourth rise in a row, with a clear signal of more to come. 12 minutes past seven, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. China's flexing of its muscles in the Indo-Pacific will loom large when the Prime Minister sits down with a Japanese counterpart in Tokyo this evening. Jacinda Adirn flew from Singapore to Japan overnight, kicking off the second leg of her international venture. The visit comes at a pertinent time with China announcing it has signed a security deal with the Solomons. Our deputy political editor, Craig McCulloch, is in Tokyo. The ceremony, the photo ops, the grips and grins. They're all part of Prime Ministerial travel abroad. But beneath the trappings is serious business. And little more serious than this. China. China. China. China, the elephant in the room. As Jacinda Ardern visits Asia. The economic superpower has knocked the west off kilter as it tests its influence in the Indo-Pacific. That only driven home this week by reports China has signed a security deal with Solomon Islands, right in New Zealand's backyard. We see no need for this agreement. We're concerned about the militarisation of the Pacific and we continue to call on the Solomon's to work with the Pacific with any concerns around their security they may have. The tension underlines a key reason for this trip, reconnecting and rebuilding relationships. New Zealand has already lodged its concerns with the Solomons and with China, though between officials, not leader to leader. There are some leaders where you simply don't drop a WhatsApp too. I would consider President Xi and President Biden to be amongst those. The topic's certain to come up, leader-to-leader tonight, when the PM sits down for the first time with her Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, just as it did with Singapore's Li Sien-Long. And it's an interest of all of the countries to have a stable, peaceful and prosperous South Pacific. Japan has expressed much the same, a critical cog, as the world's third largest economy. It ranks number four among New Zealand's trading partners, but China remains far in a way number one. That reliance worrying if tensions keep ratcheting up. It's a trick you don't want to spread yourself so thin, but you also don't want to have all the eggs in one basket. Peter Crisp from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise says the answer lies in diversification. Another reason the PM is in town. So it's good to be out of Singapore and Japan and these other high GDP per capita markets are really important for New Zealand. Where's a government are doing our bit to support our exporters to have that greater resilience. Resilience in an increasingly precarious world. Jacinda Ardern will receive a state welcoming ceremony in Tokyo this evening before her half-hour summit with Prime Minister Kishida. Once again, that pairing of pomp and purpose. It is quarter past seven. A community leader believes the justice system has no sympathy for the family of a Taranaki man shot dead by police. Māori Party co-leader Debbie Narewa Packer says chaos prices, Fano is under extreme duress and police have done little to support them. She joins us now. Tena-a-a-tieb. You were with the Fano yesterday. What are they saying? I mean, first of all, they're devastated to be bearing one of their own. They're a large family, very humble Fano. And I guess also not the thought to push back. bearing one of their own or a large fauna, a very humble family and I guess also not the thought to push back and what we have seen is some really harsh treatment to them starting from trying to get their son, their nephew, their grandson home, the forensic autopsy was in Palmer North, the coroner refused to drop him off at the undertaker and drove 45 minutes past, which meant that the Fano undertaker had to pursue the coroner, go up to New Plymouth, then take him back down and then do what they need to do at the undertakers, then catch them and go back up to New Plymouth. It's like, you know, do what they need to do at the undertakers and catch him and go back up to New Plymouth. It's like, you know, three, four hours different. So it took another day to get him home. There's a lot that they're navigating through. There's no answers. They're unclear even who shot his son. There's been a series of witnesses who were there that haven't been contacted by the police that are giving them their version of what they saw. They saw chaos running down the road, sorry, unarmed. So there's a lot, sadly, that's going around in the meantime. This Fanawa desperately trying to grieve and,, yeah, they've seen media making comments about their son, about the son's chaos's father, and yet there's nothing that's been disclosed about the police. So it's very imbalanced and very harsh, very harsh. What communication has the faunaano had from the police? They had in place the first few days Fano liaison from the police none who were Māori and we have insisted that they have independent support now which we were able to put in place for them yesterday to be able to I guess collect themselves through all of this because, you know, there has been such an imbalance of information. The police have given out nearly everything about chaos, nothing about themselves. They review themselves, which has then exposed to a whole lot of ridicule, you know, who names their son chaos, who knows. It's like, well, you know, seriously, is that what they should be contending with right now? This is, this is a mother and a father who are burying their son. You know, you have hope. You think that your children are going to straighten up and you get a chance to sort of see them, you know, become older. And I think there's a young sister that, you know, has better met her brother inside since he got a young sister that's, you know, has better left her brother's side since he got back. So there's, you know, there's grief in a normal situation, but they have been exposed under any protection or any consideration of, you know, how a mother, daughter, father, aunties would feel. The police have said, you know, the investigations are underway, therefore they can't comment. What do you think they need to be doing or seen to be doing in order to give the Fano, I guess, some relief or some reprieve about what happened? I mean, I think, you know, and I must say this, that a lot of the community are very aware of what goes on now because they're so familiar with these types of shootings that the police are investigating themselves, that he's often a briefing and a pre-briefing before everything else's sort of assessed. I think what the final needed was and I guess a bit like Moana Jackson indicated when he analyzed Stephen Wallace's shooting 22 years ago is that there needs to be sensitivity applied to the final to talk to but also they have given out everything that they can including including, you know, chaos and family been released. But they need to actually also talk about what is their date and the expectations. So again, yesterday we had witnesses and community, Māori leaders were involved in connecting the independent inspectors, or detectives, sorry, with those who were at the actual scene, who were there for the whole thing that hadn't been contacted, whose details hadn't been collected. So I guess what they need to do is be assured that there's a process that we're not going to see the whole Section 48 years that we've seen in the past, and we see a closing down of ranks around the police and around the activity of what happened. You know, it's been promoted or presented as being a routine traffic stop. It wasn't. There were dogs, yeah, there was an outline of a whole of other situations. Chaos was being running down the road. So it wasn't how it's been presented. So yeah, and it needs to be presented to the final before the public. And have the't how it's been presented. And it needs to be presented to the final before the public. And have the final enlisted a lawyer? That's underway at the moment. There is stronger support and rallying around them for that we can see they get the support for justice and answers and we don't have a 22 year fracas going on like we saw with the Wallace Fano. But the police are really, you know, again, I can say, they put Fano liaison around them, but there has been absolutely no indication of when they can expect this, how this process, who shot their son? Is it a same policeman who shot others in the past, or did it completely different? There's a lot of speculation because in the absence of fact and the amount of witnesses that were around, there's a lot of talking. And I think this is what they need to get on very quickly and stop treating the whole family like they had done something wrong. This is their child. Thank you for your time this morning. That is Māori-Mari Party co-leader, Debi Nariwapaka, who was with the Fana of Chaos Price, who was shot by police. Police were invited on the program to respond but declined. Assistant Commissioner Sandra Venables said in a statement, while the various investigations in relation to the death of chaos price are ongoing, police are not able to outline or provide certain specific information. The police expect they'll be able to give further detailing context in the fullness of time. It is 22 minutes past seven. The COVID booster vaccine campaign appears all but over, with fewer and fewer people lining up to get their booster shots. There are 980,000 people who are still eligible for a booster, but haven't got one. Jordan Bond reports. As quickly as it ramped up, demand for COVID booster shots declined. It dropped off the edge of a cliff, kind of mid to late March. It was absolutely sudden. You can draw a line on it and go, there it is. That's Anthony Roberts, owner of Palmer North's Cook Street Pharmacy. The national numbers back up his experience. Although 95% of the eligible population are double-vaxxed, just 71% are boosted. And that rate has not only stalled, it's actually falling. As fewer people get their third shot each day than become eligible for it. So is the booster campaign over? I'd like to think not, but practically it kind of looks that way. About one and four adults are fully vaccinated but not boosted. An Auckland GP in Papakura, Matari Harwood, says that's interesting because these people have clearly been willing enough to get the first two. Most people have had their two doses and it has been more difficult to get them to think about having a booster shot. That number is higher for Māori and Pacifica, with 44% of eligible vaccinated Māori adults and 40% of Pacifica not boosted. Dr Harwood says some of the reasons for the hesitancy include a fear of side effects and the possibility of further boosters. Saying, you know, if we go on to have a third, then, you know, that opens up the door to have a fourth or fifth or annual vaccinations, which is interesting given that these are the same people who have been okay about coming in for their flu vaks each year. Another likely reason for the lower uptake, there have not been widespread mandates for boosters, as there was to be double vaccinated for some people's jobs or to get a vaccine pass. Dr Harwood says others have recently had COVID, so they think they don't need a vaccine anymore. Rod Jackson is an epidemiologist at Auckland University. He thinks the booster rollout is pretty much done for now. I think it's going to take another wave or a new variant or vaccine passes to get people to get boosted. Yes, you heard right. He said vaccine passes. They're gone right now, but Rod Jackson thinks they could make a comeback. If we see our hospital system being threatened, and that's going to be threatened in a normal winter, and that may be enough to get the government to decide to make the third dose part of being fully vaccinated and reintroduced passes. Studies show a booster significantly decreases one's likelihood of ending up in hospital. But that protection and the protection offered from an actual COVID infection wanes quickly with Omicron. Rod Jackson says ahead of a winter wave of COVID, it's a no-brainer for a fourth vaccine dose, a second booster to be approved for immunocompromised older people. a second booster to be approved for immunocompromised older people. Jordan Bonn there with that report. It is 25 minutes past seven. And there's anguish in the eastern Ukrainian city of Maripo, where thousands of civilians hoping to be evacuated from the city remain trapped. Authorities wanted 6,000 people to evacuate via a corridor between Maripol and the Ukrainian-controlled, in the southeast of the country. However, it appears far fewer have left than hoped. Here's the BBC's Anna Foster. The mayor of Maripol started directing people in that city, those civilians who've been trapped for so long, towards specific locations where they could get on evacuation buses. It appeared that a corridor of exit had been agreed. This, of course, is a very finely balanced process. It involves security guarantees on both sides. That is why it's been so difficult to establish in recent weeks. But we do believe now that a small number of civilians have managed to leave Maripal. It is, of course, a tiny fraction of the around 100,000 who are still trapped in that city. Evacuation efforts will resume on Thursday in the city. It comes as the deadline set by Russia for Ukrainian soldiers hold up and the town still works to surrender has passed. Well, I think it's notable that there have been several of these Russian evacuation, surrender windows, call them what you will, that have been opened and closed in the last few days, and the remaining Ukrainian forces in Madhupol have chosen not to take them. And in fact, we've seen just in the last few hours, this video that's been released apparently of a marine commander inside that huge Azovstal steelworks talking about the men, the soldiers who are still hiding in there, the civilians as well, and saying that he feels that they are in their last hours, maybe their last days, and calling on world leaders, calling on the international community to extract them and take them to a third country. Now, Russia, when they asked them to surrender, said that they would treat them under the Geneva Convention, that they would be able to leave with their lives. But I think the fact that those opportunities to surrender are not being taken. And in fact, instead, we get this desperate appeal to the rest of the world to get them out instead, suggests that those Ukrainian forces who remain in Mariupol do not have faith or trust in Russia's assertions that they will be treated humanely. The BBC's Anna Foster. With more, here's reporter Dan Johnson. Ukrainian soldiers are holding out, but they're getting desperate. This is our appeal to the world. This could be the last appeal of our lives. We are probably facing our last days, if not ours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks. Last night, Russia says it hit more than a thousand military targets across the country. Ukrainian defences have been successful in stopping some attacks, but the president again appealed for more weapons. It is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing for years. If they have the weapons Ukraine needs, if they have the ammunition we need, it is their moral duty to help protect freedom. The BBC's Dan Johnson. Come on A-Therrero, Fakhira, more ten-a-a-a-a-a-ta. Coming up before eight on Morning Report is now 7.30. We crossed two Solomon Islands where the government has signed a security deal with China. Netflix's shares fall a whopping 30% on news. It's lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Mali, no more sharing the password. They're coming after it. They're going to make you pay. No, I'll literally means my whole baron will be gutted. I don't know if that's going to work. Now, barbs were exchanged in the first Australian leaders debate last night on topics like border security. So why did you not support turnbacks? I was on the National Security Committee just at the, in 2013, when I became Deputy Prime Minister. That was the first step. That was the first step. So you were going to do turnbacks? No. No, that's right. Okay. That's right. But why is it, Scott, that you're always looking for a division? Not looking for an agreement. No, no, I'm just looking for the accuracy and the truth. Well, there's more on that debate between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and opposition leader Anthony Albanesee before eight. Now the headlines with Anna Thomas. Thanks, coroner. Inflation is expected to hit the highest level in 30 years today when new figures come out. Prices are tip to have risen by 7% in the past year. Acting Prime Minister Grant Robertson told first up that New Zealanders are paying too much for food compared to other countries. And he says the government's looking at greater competition in the supermarket sector, but there is no silver bullet. A Māori party co-leader believes the justice system has been harsh on the family of a Taranaki woman, shot dead by police. Chaos Price was killed on Saturday night after he rammed a police car on State Highway 3 between New Plymouth and Waitara. Debbie Nariwa Packer told Morning Report, Chaos Price's found,arno need cultural sensitivity and the police have offered little support. She says the Farno is being treated like they've done something wrong. Police have not said if Chaos Price was carrying a gun and have released few details about what happened. Some civilians trapped for weeks in the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol have been able to leave, but officials say far fewer than hoped. The governor of Donetsk says officials had planned for buses to evacuate some 6,000 women, children and elderly people, but he says not many are left. State Highway 73 is closed at Rock Shelter because of a truck breakdown. Waka Kotahi says the road is closed from Arthur's Pass to Oterra and the motorists are asked to delay travel. In the world, maybe one small step closer to the Holy Grail of a single common charging port for mobile phones and other devices. A European Union panel has now backed the proposal to bring in legislation. The European Commission suggested a single mobile charging port more than a decade ago, but phone makers have been unable to find a common solution. Those are the headlines.

Netflix has hinted it will crack down on household sharing passwords as it seeks to sign up new members following a sharp fall in subscribers. The number of households using the streaming service fouled by 200,000 in the first three months of the year as it faced stiff competition from rivals. Netflix warned shareholders another 2 million subscribers were likely to leave in the three months to July with share prices plunging 30% overnight. Our revenue growth has slowed considerably the firm to hold shareholders on Tuesday after publishing its first quarter results. Lucas Shaw is the leader of entertainment, media and telecom team, Bloomberg. Kiyo-a, Lucas, welcome to the program. Now, when and how is Netflix going to do this? Well, they are going to roll out advertising, they said, in the next couple of years, providing very few specifics as to what exactly that would look like. It seems like a cheaper tier supported by advertising, so existing customers won't suddenly see ads in their feed, but new customers will have the option of selecting this tier. And existing ones could downgrade if they wanted. And then there's the kind of the password sharing side of it, where they have started to roll out some tests to curb password sharing, and they said they'll roll those out in the next year or so. Why has there been such a massive exodus in subscribers? You know, the company identified four problems, a couple of which were a more macroeconomic, you know, slower pace of buying smart TVs, the war in Ukraine, inflation in certain parts of the world, and two, that they have more control over, one of which is password sharing, which really isn't new. And it's a little bit alarming that they're identifying that suddenly as a problem. And the other, which seems sort of indisputable as competition, there are just a lot more streaming services and a lot more entertainment services in general competing for attention. Netflix, I think, feels a lot less special to people than it did many years ago. Yeah, is there a risk if they do crack down, that it will just drive people to all of those and other services, which, like you said, there are a plethora of? It's possible. It's a very fine line you have to walk between, you know, nudging people to pay for something when they kind of know that they're getting it for free and maybe they should pay and being irritating or aggravating and being anti-consumer. One of the great things about streaming has been how easy it is to sign on and off, but that becomes a bit of a problem for a business when all they have to do is click a button and cancel. Oh, thanks for that update. That is Lucas Shaw, who's the leader of entertainment media and the telecom team at Bloomberg. I've got to be honest, Corin, I'm a bit gutted because everyone in our final share just two accounts of Netflix. It would seem like quite a big move if they go down that road. It would be interesting to see whether people then peel off. There is, as you say, so much competition, it's hard to keep up. I mean, boy, you know, juggling subscriptions is a nightmare. Let us know what you think about that. The idea of sharing your password, able to do that at the moment, whether you would pay a little bit of money for that, to be able to keep doing that. Maybe not as much as the overall subscription. We'll have to wait and see. Now, let's cross the Tasman in Australia. The first leaders debate in the lead-up to the federal election next month took place last night. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and opposition leader Anthony Albanese faced off in front of 100 undecided voters. Now, the debate started out as a friendly affair with both leaders using their opponents' first names, but it got heated on the topic of border security and boat turnbacks. You were Deputy Prime Minister. Why didn't you support turnbacks then? You weren't proposing that then. No, we were not proposing. I'm sorry, we were not proposing. It was our policy. You were not proposed. Turnbacks were our policy before the 2013 election. I was the shadow immigration minister. I designed the policy. So you were on the National Security Committee, I think, for the first time at that time. And so why did you not support turnbacks? I was on the National Security Committee. We had established offshore processing just at the, in 2013, when I became Deputy Prime Minister. That was the first step. That was the first step. So you were going to do turnbacks? No. No, that's right. That was the first step. So you were going to do turnbacks? No. No, that's right. That's right. That's why is it, Scott, that you're always looking for a division, not looking for an agreement. No, no, I'm just looking for the accuracy and the truth. Now, New Zealand was referenced in their discussion on refugees. We have the same position on offshore processing, on settlement in third countries, and the same position on boat turnbacks. But what we also now have the same position on... Now what we have the same position on as well is accepting the deal that was there from New Zealand that has been on the table since Julia Gillard and John Key, all those years ago, decided it a decade ago. And if that had been accepted, that would have resolved that situation much more quickly on. Please, the government has now accepted. Well, that is Anthony Albanyzi. Now, the debate ended with Mr. Albanese accusing Prime Minister Scott Morrison of making an outrageous slur. When Mr Morrison accused him of siding with China over issues of national security, specifically in the Pacific region, those who attended the debate had this to say about the party leader's performances. I thought they both spoke very well, but at the end of the day it's the same BS that they both give. Didn't really give a future plan, just a lot of jargon. Did you think any one of them performed better than the other? No. No. I thought Scott Morrison was very clear on the answers in that he showed that he had a very good understanding of all the issues and had a plan for what they've been doing now. I think Anthony did a better job than Scott personally. I think Scott does know his stuff but he comes across incredibly scripted and whereas Anthony is able to give a bit more of a personal off-the-cuff response to things. I think there was a lot said, nothing talk or nothing said. That is some of the 100 undersided voters at last night's Australian election debate. I see papers in Australia calling it a one-all or nill-all draw between the leaders and saying they played it safe. So we'll wait to see how the next ones go. Now at 20 minutes to eight, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is one step closer to being handed over to the US after an extradition order was approved by a British court. The order is now in the hands of the UK Home Secretary Petitipatel who will give the final rubber stamp for his transfer. Assange is wanted in the US on 17 charges for violating the Espionage Act after WikiLeaks published thousands of classified material way back in 2010. Our UK correspondent Olly Barrett is with us now. Good morning, Ollie. Good morning. Okay, this is fairly significant. Now in the hands of a minister, what do you think they're going to do? Well, I think it's considered likely that Priti Patel, who's the Home Secretary, the Interior Minister in the UK, will effectively side here with the courts and is likely to approve the extradition of Julian Assange. It's not a completely done deal, though, for a couple of reasons. One is that in the intervening period of a few weeks now in which she has to make that decision, Julian Assange's legal team can make submissions to her, and they said in court today that they would be doing so. They say they have new information, serious submissions. Julian Assange's lawyer described them in the court today, but acknowledging that today's court proceedings weren't the appropriate forum to do so, and acknowledging as well that the magistrate ruling today really had no option but to refer the case now to the Home Secretary Pretty Patel. The other reason that it's not a done deal is that if Pretty Patel does go ahead and approve the extradition of Julian Assange, it is considered that there is one final avenue of appeal really for his legal team to the UK's high court. So, as I say, not done and dusted yet, but this is certainly a significant step towards the potential final extradition of Julian Assange to the United States. Just to remind us where Julian Assange is and has he said anything? He is in Belmarsh Prison where he has been for around three years now, having been arrested after leaving the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he'd stayed for several years, having tried to avoid being picked up by authorities on charges in Sweden that he denied. And now in Belmarsh, he appeared via video link in court today, really only speaking to confirm his name and say that he understood what was going on. In Belmarsh, though, last month, in Belmarsh prison, he married his fiancée. His legal team say that if he is extradited to the United States, that he could face 175 years in jail if he's convicted of the charges on which they want to try him. American authorities say that that is not necessarily going to be the case that it's far less like, far likelier that he will receive a shorter sentence than that. One of the other arguments that's been made in the long running legal case between the UK, the US and the Assange legal team is that Julian Assange's side claimed that he was a suicide risk effectively because of the harsh conditions he might face in American custody. That was the subject of a couple of court hearings. In the end, the UK side effectively won because the Americans came back with some assurances that Julian Assange would not be held under harsh conditions in America and would therefore not be a raised suicide risk as a result. So that's what saw the Supreme Court reject his latest attempts to appeal. And then when we got to today's court hearing, which was a magistrate's court hearing, it was really a procedural one. It only lasted six or seven minutes referring the final decision. I call it the final decision. As we've been discussing, there are various other avenues that could be explored, but referring that decision now to Priti Patel, the Home Secretary. Just finally, is it a political, is there a political element to this? I mean, what does this mean for free speech? As the media watchdogs, are they likely to put pressure on the government now that it is in the hands of a minister? Where does that sit? It's certainly a political story. The government will say there's nothing political about this, that it's one for the courts, that there's been an exhaustive court process, that these are serious charges in America that he is wanted on. There is a UK-US extradition treaty and that everything is being done by the book. But rights campaigners will tell you they have concerns about the free speech element of this. There were dozens of supporters of Julian Assange's outside court today, as they always are, whenever he has one of his court appearances. He even got support today from Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party. And he says he hopes that Priti Patel will recognise the huge responsibility he says that she has to stand up for free speech, journalism and democracy. But she may well not see it in the same way as Jeremy Corbyn. Olly Barrett, thank you very much for that update. Our UK correspondent, it's quarter to eight. The union movement says national suggestion that Labor Day is scrapped as a public holiday shows the party is out of touch with working people. Leader Christopher Laksin told us yesterday morning the day off should be cancelled to make up for the cost of the new Matariki holiday in June. Our view on Matariki has been look at the great idea, wonderful holiday, but which of the other holidays are you going to cancel because it costs the economy $450 million. It costs small businesses to... So would you cancel one of the other holidays if you come into government? That's what we've been saying since this bill's come to Parliament. We're very supportive Mattaiki. Why don't we cancel Labor Day? Later in the day, he walked back on his comments. Melissa and Sal Bridges is Secretary of the CTO. Kiora, Melissa, no-mike-the-Purong. Your thoughts on Christopher Luxon's comments. Well, they're quite baffling, aren't they? I mean, New Zealand is very much in the middle of the OECD in terms of public holiday. The Labor Day is a beloved public holiday by New Zealanders. I mean, obviously, it's got an important history in terms of signifying the victory for the eight-hour working day and, you know, the importance of that really showing that we need to balance our work and all of the other things that, you know, are important in life as well, spending time with family and leisure activities and so on, and to suggest taking away more of that free time to compensate for this public holiday seems a very strange call for Mr. Luxem. Almost a quip gone wrong, you know, I dig at the Labour Party, but yet entrenched and recedes in a sense very negatively from the union movement especially. Well, I mean, certainly a quip gone wrong. I mean, you have to wonder if he was serious about this, you know, needing to pay for one public holiday with another public holiday, then surely you'd take Queen's birthday weekend, which is much closer to Margarikian. So it feels like it's a deliberate dig at working people to be going after Labor Day, specifically perhaps because of what it symbolizes, which does just feel particularly petty and mean-spirited from him. In terms of that amount of money in the economy, there's also a counter to that in terms of how it can fuel tourism, as well as giving very hard workers who are working very hard on, let's be honest, quite some low wages, especially for, you know, we've got the PSA threatening strike action with their health workers yesterday. I mean, can we afford this? Can our workers afford this? For a public holiday? Yes, absolutely. And I think that you raise a very good point with people, you know, going out and spending money and going on holidays as well. But more importantly than the cost, it's actually something that as a society, you know, we value is having time and time with our family and friends. You know, Labor Day for so many people, Marks getting through winter and the start of summer, you know, it's projects in the garden and it's going away for your, you know, first summer swim and having barbecues with friends. So money's definitely spent, but actually it's a quality of life issue as well. Well, Kiyore for your time this morning, that is Melissa and Sal Bridges from the CTO. Right, some traffic news now. Waka Kotahi is warning various lights are out between Queenstown and Frankton and give way rules are applying. Now it comes after reports a storm in Queenstown has knocked out power to traffic lights and people are posting on social media about blinding lightning and heavy rain and what sounded like an explosion before an electricity cut. Local lines company Aurora says about 100 homes are without power in Franklin after the lightning strike. Get in touch with this 2101 on the text. If you're in Queenstown and you have witnessed that storm and gives a sense of how bad it is, it is now coming up towards 10 minutes to 8. Thadafizi has had a constant hammering of bad weather with at least five storms in the past year shutting off roads and cutting off communities. The area's been hit by serious storms once a storms in the past year shutting off roads and cutting off communities. The area has been hit by serious storms once a month for the past three months. Studies suggest rain like this in Altearoa is 15% more intense and 20% more likely to happen than it was 100 years ago. Here's our Taerafizi reporter at Tom Kitchen. It was June, that it was November, February, March and April. Although it's known as the first place to see the sun, the onslaught of bad weather hasn't stopped in Tairafiti. Last week in the most recent storm, a temporary bridge in the isolated Waipiro Bay was washed out. Resident Len Walker couldn't get out due to the deep water close to his house. So I was stuck there for two days. Just purely because the water was all sort of murky, you couldn't see the bottom. He says the land around him is starting to disappear. The foreshore was actually probably another 25, 30 metres out to sea. So there was a grass area out there that's all gone now. And so it's not just the flooding and all that, it's also to do with our tides. There's all sorts of stuff going on there that has taken away the land. Cyclone bowler back in the 80s was huge, but Len Walker says big downpoles are hitting more and more often. That was like a once-in-a-lifetime event, but these sorts of weather events are happening just about every year and becoming more multiple times throughout the year as well. Tarrafiti Contractors is based in Ruatoria. Its director Kat Kaiwai says State Highway 35, the road from Gisbon to the East Cape isn't always shut during a storm, but in the last two storms it was. So I think with the road closures, that has been, and the length of time, that has been, I suppose, a telling point of how serious this has been this time around. She praises the resilience of East Coast residents but says it might mean issues go unreported. It could be detrimental in the fact that people aren't aware of what they're going through because they're so used to managing it themselves, whether they cut their own trees, whether they cut tracks through trees, whether they cut tracks through their farms to make roads and all of that. So they've managed to get by, but then other people don't know that there's a need. Gisbon District Councillor in the Matakawa Wayapu Ward, Bill Burdett, says Wohokata he hasn't cared enough about the highway. He says he told them as much at a recent meeting. I don't mince words, I just hooked in and told them. It was unacceptable to have our state highway left in abeyance like it has been when they spend mega millions on all sorts of roads in the cities and outside of Wellington. Neither Environment Minister David Parker or Climate Change Minister James Shaw would be interviewed for this story. But a government spokesperson calls a recent and regular flooding in Tairaerapity a serious concern. There's mitigation work underway, such as resource management and freshwater reforms. The government's also approved more than $13 million to improve State Highway 35. Seven minutes to seven, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Now, there is mounting frustration that a long-awaited new bridge connecting two central North Island districts can't yet be used. The new Mangawakea Bridge over the Rangatiki River is scheduled to open in June. It's months too late for some. Manawatu reporter Jimmy Ellingham is more. Beneath the imposing grey cliffs carved out by the river, Manawatu District Councillor Andrew Quarry looks at the finished new bridge and wonders why barriers are blocking traffic from travelling across. This had the opportunity of being a really good, good news story. It was a bridge that was designed and built to service an area. It was going to be opened six months earlier than planned. And instead of being a good news story, it's become a laughing stock, an absolute joke. Construction started in 2020 and finished ahead of schedule earlier this year to replace the old bridge linking the Carfato Valley with Mangawaka. All it needs doing is some road alignment work at the ends, a job Andrew Quarry says could be done in hours. The old structure is open to vehicles weighing less than six tonnes, but that's no good for service trucks in this area of farms, orchards and forestry operations. Since the old bridge was deemed unsafe for heavy loads in 2016, they've been forced to win their way along an alternative route that can add 45 minutes of travel each way. For drivers such as Barry Ma, delays in opening the bridge are hitting the hip pocket. Well, it's very frustrating. So basically, we've're burning an hour's worth of fuel for no good reason. It's time. It's non-active time. We could be doing a lot more with our time than going a long way around here. The new bridge is a joint project between the Manuatu and Langekei District Councils. The river water below is the boundary between the two authorities. Barry Ma can't hide his frustration of the situation. There's a perfectly good bridge here, ready to go go and council won't open it because they want a bloody opening ceremony. That's all that's holding it up. They've driven big trucks across at our cart and metal, across the metal the other side with it. They've used it for their convenience, but then shut it for everyone else and they don't care. Manawatu District councillors say the ceremony is the reason for the delay. At a meeting this month, they passed a resolution to get their side of the bridge ready as quickly as possible and blame the delays on Rangatike Council. They say Rangatike has agreed with local iwi Nati Hauiti, an opening ceremony would happen in June, where a poor, a landpost, would be unveiled. Rangatike Mayor Andy Watson disputes the suggestion the bridge could have opened in February and says the Manuatu Council organised a contract. The June date was always part of the agreement that they entered into with Rangatake District Council with regard to Iwi. As part of that agreement, there would be a poe that would be constructed and that would be put in place before the bridge was opened. Andy Watson says that Angateke Council is working with contractors on announcing an opening date that will please all parties. Manuatu Councillor Andrew Quarry says traffic should be allowed on the bridge now, and an opening ceremony could be held later for Carfito Valley resident Nikki Hobson, who runs an 800 hectare sheep and beef farm with husband Mark, the way fought is clear. What we want, as farmers up this valley, is we want to have access to the bridge now, and when they're all ready, when they've all sorted out their issues, they can officially open it. The new bridge costs $11 million. The council's paid $2.6 million each, and Waka-Kortahi New Zealand Transport Agency covered the rest. It is three minutes to eight. Some feedback to the Queensland power outage. Someone has written in more like a thousand homes are out from Frankton to Fern Hill. Step up Aurora with correct and up-to-date news. Regards Mike. Yes, Aurora reports lightning strike at Frankton Grid Exit Point. Now the outages from Arrowtown through Queenstown to Gonokie. Aurora states that 100 homes are affected, but that area covers thousands of homes. We'll bring you up to date on that as soon as more information comes in. So a fairly significant power outage following that storm in Queenstown. This one here says, yeah, high current power off right in Queenstown 2. How will I warm my organic alkym porridge and soy almond milk? Oh, poor Duncan. Yeah, sounds tough, doesn't it? On the decline and take-up of boosters, this person says you cannot have a booster for three months after having COVID. So naturally, there is a slump as a huge numbers of people having COVID in February, and those who had a very mild version or asymptomatic will possibly not want to bother. Morena, Andrews says, is one reason for not getting booster the third Vax is because people have had Omicron and therefore perceive they don't need it. And on dumping Labor Day, Peter has emailed, now we have Matariki in June. Let's shift Queen's birthday to a better time of year like the end of September. After all, it isn't actually her birthday, is it? Another person says the current NZ movement going into bat for Labor Day and waxing on about quality of life for workers is somewhat ironic, given their non-performance for workers in recent years. And someone has said Loxin's problem is that he sees workers as a business expense as opposed to hardworking Kiwis who deserve a day off from time to time to spend with friends and fauno. He is completely out of touch with your average Kiwi. All righty, it is just coming up towards 8 o'clock at a centre morning report on RNZ National. No, my hearty, may, haremai, piqui, kaki, mai, kā, kātai, Good morning, New Zealand, you're listening to Morning Report on RNZ National. Well, it's a bit wet today with a few rain or shells, warm though, for most of the motun. Korkorandem, Tenei, in this hour, Aotearoa and Australia have reacted to Solomon Island's security deal with China, with frustration. We'll speak to Foreign Minister Nanaiamahuta. Our business editor Giles Beckford joins us to discuss what is expected to be our biggest annual inflation rise in more than 30 years. Also before nine unrest on Mount Ruapu enters its fourth week. Researchers have made a breakthrough that could improve predictions of volcanic eruptions. And after a two-year hiatus, Rio de Janeiro's 10-day carnival returns. In Z News at 8 o'clock. Good morning. I'm Anna Thomas. An economist says soaring inflation is likely to continue for a couple of years. The latest quarterly cost of living index will be released later this morning and is widely tipped to hit a decades high of more than 7%. The reserve bank's target is between 1 and 3%. A&Z economist Finn Robinson says high inflation could stick around for some time. Because inflation has become pretty entrenched, especially in the domestic economy, we think it might actually take quite a while for them to bring inflation back down. So we're sort of looking more at sort of 2024 before inflation is constantly back to the 2% target. Finn Robinson says he expects the Reserve Bank to keep increasing the official cash rate for the rest of the year. The Māori Party co-leader believes the justice system has been harsh on the family of a Taranaki man shot dead by police. Chaos Price was killed on Saturday night after he rammed a police car on State Highway 3 between New Plymouth and Waitara. Debbie Nariwa Packer told Morning Report, chaos prices far no, need to be treated with cultural sensitivity and the police have offered little support. What they need to do is be assured that there's a process that we're not going to see the whole Section 48 years as we've seen in the past. And we see a closing down of ranks around the police and around the activity of what happened. Debbie Nariwapaka says the Price family is devastated to be burying one of their own. Police say they are not able to comment while the investigation is ongoing. Russia appears to be on the verge of completely overwhelming the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Earlier, some civilians were able to leave Mariupo, but far fewer than hoped. World Watch, as Max Toll, has more. A Ukrainian commander in Mariupol told Ukrainian TV, the final few based in the city are doing their best to resist Russian forces, but painted a bleak picture. He says the situation at a steel plant, one of the last sites still under Ukrainian control, is critical. Both troops and civilians are holed up there. Earlier, officials had planned for buses to evacuate some 6,000 women, children and elderly people from Mariupol, but, without specific numbers, it appears not many left. A former residents of Mariupol told the BBC he has friends and family who refused to leave. Local lines company Aurora says a lightning strike has knocked out power in Queenstown, Glenorkey, Frankton, but has been now restored in Arrowtown. On social media people are describing an explosive thunderstorm before the power went out. Waka Kota'i says due to traffic signal faults in a number of locations in Queensland and Frankton, the giveaway rules now apply. MetServa says only modest amounts of rain has fallen, but there has been nine lightning strikes near the airport, and the range is quite close to central Queensland. The COVID booster rate has stalled and is now in reverse, as more people become eligible. Nearly a million people have had two doses, but haven't got a third. Jordan Bond reports. Health experts say three courses of the vaccine should be considered a full course rather than two, but New Zealand's booster rollout has slowed to a crawl. At its peak, 73% of those eligible were boosted, compared to 95% double-vaxed. But as more people are able to get the third dose each day, the percentage uptake has actually been falling and is now a shade over 71%. A GP in Auckland, Matari Harwood, says the lower uptake is because of a mix of vaccine fatigue, fear of side effects and the booster not being widely mandated. Dr Harwood says others have recently had COVID so they don't think they need a vaccine anymore. The Prime Minister says the latest development in the security relationship between Solomon Islands and China is something Pacific leaders would have liked to discuss. But Jacinda Adirn says the new security pact was signed before they had the chance. Countries like New Zealand, Australia and the US have expressed concern about the agreement and the potential it gives for China to establish a military base in the Pacific. Ms. Ardun says, while it's been on leaders' radar, she can't just pick up the phone when issues like this come up. There are some leaders where you simply don't drop a WhatsApp too. I would consider President Xi and President Biden to be amongst those. Jacinda Ardennes in Japan today for the second leg of her trade mission after visiting Singapore. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen, are taking part in a televised debate. It's taking place four days before the second and final round of the presidential election. The BBC's Hugh Schofield reports. The presidential debate has been a feature of French election since 1974. Watched by many millions of voters, it may not have ever decided the outcome of an election, but it certainly exerted a powerful influence. This time, Marine Le Pen will be anxious to avoid the disastrous performance she gave at the last debate in 2017, also against Emmanuel Macron, where her poor grasp of various subjects was embarrassingly on display. For the president's part, he will need to avoid appearing arrogant and technocratic, faults regularly ascribed to him by many French voters. The search for a fisher missing since Sunday is resuming this morning. The man had been fishing at Torreiri. The Coast Guard and Air Force have been searching by air and sea. Police say another aerial search will be conducted near Wahee Beach today. A ground search is planned for tomorrow. Searchers are looking for a chili bin, life jacket and oars and people in the area are asked to report any items they find. And that's the news. Now with sport, here's Barry Guy. Wimbledon is barred Russian and Belarusian players from this year's grand slam due to the invasion of Ukraine, becoming the first tennis tournament to ban individual competitors from the two countries. The decision means world means number two, Daniel Medvedev and women's number four, Arena Sabalinka won't be there. The BBC's Andy Swiss reports. Players from both countries are currently allowed to compete on the tennis tour, although not under their national flags. The head of the women's tour, Steve Simon, has previously said that players from Russia and Belarus shouldn't be penalised because of what he called the decisions of an authoritarian leadership. But a former Ukrainian player Alexander Dolgopoulov has praised Wimbledon's stance, saying it has stepped up and shown the world an example. Moana Pacifica have had a fourth game postponed this Super Rugby season with tomorrow night's clash with the Western Force in Melbourne called off due to COVID outbreak in the Australian team. Meanwhile, New Zealand Rugby says there is no room for being lax on head injuries as the red cards continue to pile up in Super Rugby. NZR's head of professional rugby, Chris Lendrum, believes referees have managed well so far. I don't think the decisions over the last couple of weeks represent any sort of dramatic shift. They're just a reminder of how seriously we have to take those issues in the game and we are. And Wright's Holder Spark Sport have announced that TV3 will be the exclusive free-to-air broadcast partner for this year's Women's Rug rugby world cup in October and November. The stars have scored their third win over the tactics in second and four days as they held on for a 56-48 win in the A&Z Netball Premiership. It was the star's first game at home this season with the competition disrupted by COVID. Stars Captain Maya Wilson was full of praise for their defensive end. Ali Temu had a woman blinder of a game today and got us in really critical ball. There's still some connection pieces on attack that we need to look at, Gina and myself, one of them, but I think that's the exciting thing about playing these back-to-back games. You have to adapt quite quickly. And the stars are back in action on Sunday against the top of the table mystics. And a couple of key Premier League games this morning half time. There's no score between Manchester City and Brighton, and they've just started the second half and Arsenal lead Chelsea 3-2. Goina. Nauru. Ha-Ni-Ni-Nor.

Aoteoroa and Australia have reacted with frustration to the news that Solomon Islands has gone ahead and signed a security agreement with China. The deal that no one outside the government has seen apparently allows Chinese forces to help maintain social order in the nation. Joining us now is freelance journalist in Honiara, Gina Kekiya. Welcome to the program. Good morning, Mani. Thank you for having me. Now tell us, how do we know, well, what do we know about what's in this deal? Thank you so much. Not much, really, except that the framework or the framework of the agreement was based on the national security strategy, which the government completed in 2020, basically that's all we know about what the framework or the treaty is about. about what the framework or the treaty is about. And yes, the leaked document that was shared by social media recently. So basically, those are the things that we know about the treaty, not even us in Somonai, the media, really have seen the document as well. And in Parliament yesterday, the Prime Minister make mention that there are processes which they will have to follow and that the document will also be made known for the public that's what also the government Ministry of Foreign Affairs, permanent secretary, said in one of the press conferences that they had with the media. How are people reacting in Solomon Islands to this agreement being signed? I guess it's mixed in the country at the moment, especially, you know, it's like in Solomon Islands, only less than 30% of the population really have access to the internet, so those who have access to information, they understand and know what's been happening. But for the like-minded Solomon Islanders who really do not have access to information, it's something which is a worry, especially when decisions are made on the behalf without their knowledge. So it's something which is a worry mainly, especially for us in Solomon Islands, that the process has to be transpiring as possible so that everyone will understand and get the feeling of what this agreement is about. What has the Prime Minister Sogavare's justification been in signing this agreement and, like you say, providing not much transparency about what's actually in the deal? Yeah, basically I guess what he's always emphasising on is like Solomon Islands as the Soviet country has, you know, the right to do whatever it wants and make agreements with whichever country they see fit to make agreements with, basically. And he also made mention that Solomon Islands went into this arrangement with China with eyes wide open. went into this arrangement with China, with eyes wide open, and they are guided by the national interests, meaning it's the interests of the people, basically, that's what he said. And he said that they understand the fragility of peace, which the country is faced at the moment, and their duty as a government is to protect the people, the properties and basically critical national infrastructure. And if you talk about national infrastructure, the 23 games infrastructure which are built by China. And basically when you talk about properties, most of the properties in Solomon Islands are based in Honiara and not in Solomon Islands or even the rural areas for that matter. Oh, kiyoda, for your time this morning and that analysis, that is freelance journalist in Oniara, Gina Kikia. Well, listening to that was Foreign Minister Nanaya Mahuta who joins us now. Kiyoda, good morning. Morning. Does New Zealand have a better idea if people in in Solomons don't, of what's in this deal? No, and that's the challenge in terms of bringing this issue into a regional conversation so that more of the Pacific neighbours can have greater visibility around the terms and conditions of these arrangements between China and Solomon Islands. So we're calling for the Pacific Island Forum to make this a critical agenda item so that all Pacific nations can discuss the issues of regional security and regional sovereign. I mean, have you asked your counterparts for an explanation as to what's in it? No, however, there has been high-level engagements and officials' level, and certainly between our ambassadors, both in China and in Honiara. So, you know, it's going to be a matter of trying to bring the Solomon's into a conversation rather than the Solomon's feeling like they're defending their sovereignty and they're being outcast from the rest of the Pacific. The whole of the Pacific want to discuss this issue because no one's got a lot of visibility on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Is this a failure by New Zealand and Australia? I see in Australia Penny Wong, the Senator, the Labor opposition spokesperson for foreign affairs, calling this the biggest foreign affairs failure by Australia in 80 years? Well, look, New Zealand's upheld its part of an agreement for the region, which is under the Big Tower Declaration on Defence and Security matters, we will respond. We're the closest neighbours. So if you take the latest unrest in the Solomon Islands, New Zealand, alongside Australia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji responded quickly and readily to the unrest that was there in order to maintain stability as those internal domestic issues were being worked through. On another front, in terms of natural disasters, we demonstrated exactly the same thing in relation to the eruption in Tonga. So, you know, the Pacific community uphold the Bikawa Declaration to say, we are the closest neighbours, we can respond, and we can support when needed on the... No, sure, and I appreciate that. But do you agree with the sentiments that is being expressed by Penny Wong and others, including Julie Bishop, a former Liberal, that this is a failure by Australia and I guess by extension in New Zealand, to allow China to have greater influence over a key neighbour? No, I don't agree with that statement to the extent that we have responded to the Solomon Islands, and we've got to remember even the local community in the Solomon State have visibility on this issue, and the Parliament is split on the terms and conditions of the agreement which they too have not seen. This is a part of the domestic internal dispute that is taking place at the moment. Do we have a diplomatic red line here? If China was to establish a military base in Solomon's and I know to be fair there have been assurances from the government that that's not going to be the case, but it could be that Chinese military personnel are called in. Is there a point at which New Zealand has to do something, call an ambassadors do something, where you would say, no, that's too far? Well, that's premature because both China and Solomon have been at pains on this recent signing to say that that is not the case. New Zealand, by extension, has said, well, then we need to discuss these issues as a part of the Pacific Island Forum so that all Pacific Nations have the ability to hold those statements to account, but also to investigate the terms and conditions of the arrangement. But why are we worried then? If we're accepting their assurances that they're not going to go put a base there. Nobody's seen the exact terms and conditions of the agreement not the whole of the Parliament of the Solomon's certainly not the Solomon Island peoples and not Pacific nations who are the closest neighbours to the Solomon so we need these issues to be fully discussed within the Pacific Island Forum so do you have concerns about the government in Solomon Islands that their lack of transparency? I have concerns that based on a number of representations to ensure that this is fully discussed because of the regional implication that this has not been given priorities, certainly by the Solomon Islands. They have given assurances, we must take them at their word, respecting their sovereignty. However, regional security issues, regional sovereignty issues are a matter for a broader forum, and we see the Pacific Island Forum as the best place to bring those issues together so that we can get greater transparency and discuss these issues. And when's that forum? That's in a few weeks, is it, a few months? Shortly, around about June. And Fiji is hosting the next forum. Top of the agenda, I imagine. Yeah, that's certainly what New Zealand is calling for, and I understand a number of other Pacific countries have called for this to be a priority issue, to be discussed at the forum. Nana'amahu, Keota, thank you very much for your time. That is the foreign minister there. It is coming up to 20 minutes past eight. Hold on to your hats. The latest inflation figures are out this morning to give us his best guess and a cough of what it will be with us is our business editor, Giles Beckford. Morena, Giles, what are you expecting? Kyromania, I don't have expectations other than it will be a high number. The market consensus seems to be 7% plus for the year. A quarterly figure of 2% or more. Just look at some of the key drivers of the quarterly figure. Higher housing costs, they've gone up more than 2% in the past three months. Transport costs are up nearly 4% and petrol is up 9% in this past quarter. And the government's cut to the fuel tax will not really impinge on that contribution. 3% rise in food prices, 1% rise in rents and fairly high across the board, things such as building costs and alike. So it will be fairly broad-based. What are the implications here? Well, very simply put, it means that if it's allowed to go unchecked, then rampant inflation causes significant damage to the economy. You get to the point where people start to pull in their spending. That then leads to lower economic activity. In due course, it requires, of course, a really stern response from the Reserve Bank, and we've already seen them starting that with a big rise in the official cash rate. 50 basis points a couple of weeks ago. There are bets that it could be another 50 basis points in May and then steady rises through to the end of the year. So the cash rate would go from around 1% at the start of the year through to 3% by the end of the year. It's a plague which in in an economic sense, can't be allowed to go unchecked, and that will then require a real stern response. Kiyore, Giles, that is Giles Beckford, our business editor. It's 21 minutes past 8. Just updating on that weather and traffic in Queenstown. Traffic lights are out between Queenstown. This is, well, around Queenstown, after a storm knocked out of power. Power to many in the town. It sounds like hundreds. People have been posting on social media that there was blinding lightning and heavy rain and what sounded like an explosion before the electricity wean went out and certainly reports we have had suggest. It's right into Queenst Queensland at Frankton area. Local lines company Aurora says about 100 homes are without power and as I say our listeners have been telling us it might be more like thousands so we'll keep you up to date on that. It's 22 minutes past eight. Volcan it can rest rumbling around Mount Rupu is now into its fourth week. The heightened unrest tremor levels remain elevated, which is the longest period of tremors recorded over the past 20 years. One bit of good news is the temperature of the crater lake has stabilised at 37 degrees after increasing by 7 degrees over the past month. Joining us to make sense of what is happening at Teweya, Mui is GNS duty volcanologist Aynas Ma Zou. Morena, tell us with this latest update, what does it mean is now four weeks into this latest unrest? Yeah, Morena, yeah, the sustained nature of the volcanic onrace coupled with the volcanic tremor signals we can see that elevated gas output and hot lake remain indicative of processes being driven by molten rock, magma as we call it, interacting with the geothermal system within the volcano. With this, is the likelihood of an eruption increasing? Because we have been for four weeks now with a really strong travel and elevated unrest, so the likelihood of an eruption is going higher, but we still at the first, the most likely outcome, is that no eruption will take place. What does the effects around the lake temperature, Tewa Amui, being stabilized at 37 degrees? What does that tell us? So usually we have over the past 30 days, the lake temperature increased by 7 degrees, which is like previous heating phases at RAPU. But the heating has slowed down and temperatures have now been steady around 37 degrees for the last week. And this slowing of heating in spite of the ongoing strong level of volcanic tremor continues to indicate height on volcanic unrest as pressure could be building up at depth. Now, for people who, obviously, long weekend ahead, how dangerous is a situation should people be staying away from the region or is it okay to visit? So about the Tongaro National Park on Rappahoe, especially. So we have a Department of Conservation, who are responsible for putting exclusion zones in the park. They currently have a two-kilomet zone in place so that people are not close to the active vent. And so if people want to go there, they have to look at the Department Conservation webpage and Facebook page also, and they will have all the information that they can provide. And also the Department Conservation are responsible for managing access to the park. And the Tongue Arrow Crossing, if you want to go to the Tongue Arrow Crossing, it's about 20 kilometres from the active vent atua Péhu. Oh, Kjorda for that update. That is, Genese-Duty volcanologist Agnes Mazo. It is 25 minutes past 8. Now to the science of predicting an eruption, identifying the seismic frequency pattern could be a breakthrough in forecasting when volcanoes will blow their tops. Groundbreaking research by the universities of Canterbury, Auckland and Brussels has been published in the International Journal Nature Communications. It was just out last night. Now, joining us to discuss this as senior lecturer in civil and natural resources engineering at Canterbury University, Dr David Dempsey. Good morning to you. Morena. This sounds pretty exciting. Just give us an idea of how this works. How do you, you might be able to actually predict when a volcano erupts? Yeah, so what we've done is we've taken a look at six volcanoes around the world, three here in New Zealand, Ruupaihu, Tongedero and Fakhari. And we've looked at about 18 eruptions there. Oh, I think we might have lost, David. Can you hear me? We have, I think that definitely tells us we've lost David. He was just going to explain to us about this new research, which is using algorithms, I believe, to try and identify frequency of patterns for seismic activity, which could go on to predict volcanoes. I'd just see if we can get him back. We are trying. We might have to move on. We will move on and see if we can come back. He must be up the moonger. He must be on the mountain right now. To other news in the meantime, Prince Harry, who is in Europe for the Invictus Games, has been speaking to US morning television. In an interview for NBC's Today program, he said he went to see his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, and made sure she had what he had described as the right people around her. Harry and his wife, Megan, went to Windsor Castle for the visit last week, their first as a couple since leaving Royal duties two years ago. The prince spoke to Hoda Cotby. It was just so nice to see her. She's on grateful, and she's always got a great sense of humor with me, and I'm making sure that she's, you know, protected and got the right people around there. Well, you make her laugh. That's what she always says. Did you do it again? Yes, yeah, I did. Both Megan and I and T with her. So it was really nice to catch up with her. And, you know, home for me now is, you know, for the time being. It's in the state. And it really, and it feels that way as well. Does it? Yeah. We've been welcomed with open arms. Yeah. And it's got such a great community up in Santa Barbara. So you feel like that's home more for you. Yeah. BBC Royal correspondent Nicholas Wichel said the interview had raised eyebrows within the royal household. That is putting it mildly and not so much in the palace but within the rest of the family. It's just really rather bizarre. Perhaps he didn't really think through what he was saying. But what was his meaning? Does he really imagine that it takes him to come in for the first time for a year to ensure that the Queen is protected and has got the right people around her, what does that say about the Queen's children and her other grandchildren who are there permanently, who are doing precisely that? So it's just rather strange, and I would think that people within the royal household and within the rest of the family will be baffled and really quite bemused. Whether this was intended to be a barbed remark aimed at them is not clear. I mean, it wasn't exactly on the strength of what we've seen so far exactly the most searching of interviews. You would have thought that he might have been asked, well, what do you mean? But, of course, there was no sign of that. On the more positive frame, it's reassuring, I think, that the meeting took place, that bridges are being built. His relationship with his grandmother, with Queen Elizabeth, has always been good, though it is strained, of course, with other members of the royal family, particularly his father and his brother. And I think that it is reassuring that he said the Queen, to quote him, she's on great form. Well, we're all aware of the health concerns about Queen Elizabeth. She is 96 tomorrow, expected to go up to her home at Sandringham in Norfolk for that. So I think the fact that somebody who has sat down with her, who has clearly had a very amicable and friendly conversation with her, is able to say that she's on great form. That is reassuring. That was BBC Royal correspondent, Nicholas Wichell. It is 29 minutes past 8. Duncan, who wasn't able to heat up his organic porridge, has texted in to say power is back on, crisis averted. He got his porridge, thank goodness. With almond soy milk to boot. Giles Beckford is here to tell us what is coming up now, well, to tell us how the markets are faring. Giles. Thank you, Coran. Wall Street has ended a bit of a mix showing good earnings for the big companies such as IBM. That helped the mainstream stocks, big technology. Feeling the fallout from Netflix's poor result, where it lost subscribers forecast other big losses in subscriptions through the year. Its shares were down 36%. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up three quarters of a percent. The S&P 500 was marginally lower, and I mean a handful of points. The NASDAQ was down 1.2%. Around top 50 indexes hovering just below 12,000 after a 1.1% gain yesterday, 130 points. New Zealand dollar, it's had a bit of a spring in its step overnight on the back of a weaker US dollar, which was hit by a fall in US wholesale interest rates. So Kiwi trading at just over 68 US cents, 91.3 Australian, 52.1 British Pence, 0.627 euro, 86.9 Japanese yen, and 4.37 yuan. Brink crude oil, fractionally higher, a handful of cents, up at $107.60 US a barrel. Gold is down $3 to $1,954 US dollars an ounce. We may have a little bit about inflation in our lunchtime program, but we'll bring you all the other business news and numbers around 20 past 12 in Midday Report. Kiyodara, thank you very much. Charles Beckford there with your markets update this morning. Now, Ifai Akine, still to come before 9 here on Morning Report. We'll have the latest on that widespread power outage in Queensland, porridge and all. Myrtle rust reaches the Chatham Islands, but there's a twist in the tail on that one. And hundreds of young people will be out on the weekend cleaning graves of returned servicemen in readiness for Anzac Day. Now the headlines with Anna Thomas. Foreign Minister Nana Mahuta says the terms of a security agreement Solomon Islands have signed with China are a mystery to everyone in the Pacific. The deal apparently allows Chinese forces to help maintain social order in the nation. Ms Mahuta told Morning Report the signing of the agreement is not a foreign affairs failure and will be discussed at the Intergovernmental Pacific Islands Forum in June. Ukrainian officials say an attempt to evacuate several thousand of the remaining civilians trapped in the devastated city of Mariupo hasn't gone to plan. They're blaming Russian forces who have been besieging the city for seven weeks. They say far fewer buses than planned got into Maripo, enabling only a few of those who had gathered to board. President Volodymya Zelensky says the situation in Maripol is deteriorating. Some residents are without power in Queensland. Glen Orki and Frankton, after a lightning strike this morning, power has been restored in Arotown. An Aurora Energy spokesperson said the lightning strike hit the Frankton grid exit point. People in Queensland have reported hearing what sounded like an explosion before the power went out. Power is out to the skyline gondola, the remarkable ski field. Queensland Motorpark in the industrial area. An airport spokesperson said the airport had backup generators and was still operational. An economist expects wages to eventually catch up with the increased cost of living. The latest quarterly cost of living index to be released later this morning is widely tipped to be more than 7% well above the Reserve Bank's target. A&Z economist Finn Robinson told Morning report, he thinks pay rates will increase about 5% this year once workers' annual wage reviews start to take effect. And a man was taken to Palmerston North Hospital after an incident in Shannon last night. The Horo Fenua Mayor Bernie Wondon told Irene said he understood a man had turned up at the four square with a gunshot wound. Police say initial indications are that this was a targeted incident. And that's the news. Kiyura, I'm Amil Bonovan, and today on the detail the misunderstanding about how much public funding, public transport, gets. Ticket is the first pot of money, which is what you hand over. Then some comes from your local council, then some comes from your fuel taxes and road user charges, and then some comes from general taxation. The road user charges, and then some comes from general taxation. The short answer is that there is a huge amount of subsidy in public transport, and it comes from many different places. The detail on Apple, Spotify, RNZ, or wherever you get your podcasts. Now looking at the weather around the country today, Kaitai, Fungare and Auckland showers possibly heavy from the afternoon all 23. Hamilton, charts of.

Iron said news, it is 24 to 9. Kiora Anna, this is morning report. As we've been reporting, Queenstown residents have woken up to a violent thunderstorm, which has knocked out power across the region. Local Lions Company Aurora says residents across Queenstown, Glenorke and Frankton are affected, and traffic signals are also down. Walker Kutahi says give way rules now apply at affected intersections. And with us now is Matt Settle, Aurora Energy General Manager of Operations and Network Performance. Good morning, Matt. What's happened? Good morning. A very large lightning strike in the area this morning as it hit the ground very close to the grid exit point which had a big impact on the local area. We had significant safety devices operate that cut power to the entire region and yet resulted in everybody having a very black start this morning. So do we know how many homes have been affected? In the Queensland area we're running at about we're running about 5,000 customers that were impacted this morning. That's a rough estimation. We're currently now, after some extensive inspections with field crews this morning, we're at a point now where we are actively restoring customers, and we're expecting to be able to progress through that this morning and ensure that we get everybody back on supplies very soon. So it wasn't permanent damage? Was this a precautionary measure because of the lightning? Yeah, at this point. We haven't identified any permanent damage that would prevent us restoring customers. It was just a significant safety operation, ensure that we didn't damage plant and were able to put people back on. And what about the roads, the traffic lights and that sort of thing? Are they coming back? They will be coming back too. As we restore power, the traffic lights will be coming back online. At this stage, we have got all of Queensland and the Queensland CBD area back online. It's got Franklin and Glenorkey back on, and we're continuing to work through the rest of the impacted customers. Thank you, Matt, for that update. That is Matt Settle, the Aurora Energy, General Manager of Operations and Network Performance. walkie back on and we're continuing to work through the rest of the impacted customers. Thank you, Matt, for that update. That is Matt Settle there, Aurora Energy, General Manager of Operations and Network Performance. It's 22 minutes to nine. And with us now is Queensland Lakes District Council Mayor Jim Bolt. Kilda, Jim, did you get working up this morning? No, I didn't, I was up and about, and I was just putting my toaster in the toaster when the lights went out. So it was thoroughly disappointing. Did you see... Did you see the lightning? Yes, in fact, I got up about six and they'd been lying in bed watching the lightning flashing up in the mountains. But the one that took out the power, the thunder that followed it was just amazing. It just shook our house at Lake Hays to the foundation. It's incredible. And what are locals telling you we're getting a lot of feedback and you've just added to the discussion about everyone's breakfast this morning in the Queensland District? But how are locals doing? What are you hearing on the ground there? Oh, look, you know, we live in the mountains and we get power cuts from time to time in the winter time we're a bit used to these things it's an annoyance but everybody's getting on with it probably the biggest concern was traffic lights going out which caused a bit of maim as you'd imagine but you know people have a habit of getting on with these things and I think I just heard as I was waiting, Aurora, are telling you that we're getting the power back on again. So I'll go and cook my toast and have a shower after the power comes back on. Oh, good to hear. That is Queensland Lakes District Council Mayor Jim Bolt on the latest of that thunderstorm down south. Yes. Now, questions are being asked about whether 30 hectares of native forest really needs to be felled to make way for a long-awaited bypass in northern Taranaki. Details of another route for the State Highway 3. Mountain Messenger bypass have emerged that suggests that it being chosen, it would have met, if it had been chosen, it would have met the budget and saved the forest. Construction on the bypass is due to begin in September. Taranaki-Funganui reporter Robin Martin has more. Documents released under the Official Information Act reveal the planned destruction of more than 30 hectares of native forest for the bypass could be avoided. Waka Kotahi records show that another route following the existing one on State Highway 3 in Taranaki meets the project objectives and is price competitive, leaving some questioning why the agency is carving another passage through the Mangapepepeake Valley. Marie Gibbs, a spokesperson for the Pothama Charitable Trust, says the decision doesn't make sense. Trust says the decision doesn't make sense. Destroying 18 hectares of wetlands and 30 plus hectares of native bush, but it's a similar price project or way less damage on the online route. The Trust has opposed the bypass along with some Manga Pekekeke farmers. Ms Gibbs says they've been in the dark about the details of the more environmentally friendly and cost-effective route. And the thing that's concerning to us that it's March 22 and we've been involved in this for four to five years and we've only just learned about it. Official documents show the option was considered four years ago when all the proposed bypass routes were re-evaluated against a $150 million budget. An advisor to the project, who R&Z has agreed not to identify, says the option came in at $206 million. That was comparable to Waka Kotahi's preferred Manga Pekepeake Valley route, which was priced at just under 200 million. But the advisor says the Transport Agency's board was told the more environmentally friendly alternative would cost a steep $380 million, the original costing, not the re-evaluated price. That was never presented in the consent hearing and it's only come to light through the request of the board papers. It's very odd that something like that would not have been part of the documentation as part of the assessment of the alternatives that the territorial authority would need to go through. Waka Kutahi says this information has been presented as evidence during consent hearings and in the Environment Court and High Court. But Marie Gibbs says the recently released documents raised questions about what the courts have been told. The equivalent option that they presented to the courts, the NZTA presented to the courts, they told the courts it was $382 million to deliver an online route that met the project objectives. And they didn't disclose that there was actually $198 million route that were the new tunnel and met all the project objectives. Waka Kotahi says the option along the existing highway has been assessed in detail and does not meet the project's resilience and safety objectives. Manafenua, Nati Tama, also scored it poorly from a cultural perspective. Construction of the bypass is now likely to cost more than $300 million. It is 17 minutes to nine. Now, the power outage in Queensland. The poor old mea missed out on his toast. The toaster went bung just as he pushed it down. Duncan had texted in to say he missed out on his organic porridge. He was heating that up. But Mike has texted, so just just had sausage-eged tomato with fried bread on the barbecue power, still off at Lake Hayes. Y'all. That's... Hardy souls. It's not all right. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Lynn Freeman, in here with 9 to noon. Yeah, Kiyotokoran. We're going to start by looking at a new research showing that New Zealand's, it's a great place to be if you're an older person, not so great if you're younger. A report identifies trends and challenges when it comes to the state of well-being in the Otero. Also looking at how a group of schoolboy rugby players in Gisbon are helping with a study into concussion, trying to find ways to detect concussion more quickly and more accurately. And after 10, I mentioned yesterday, we'd be talking to Dealey Ephron. She's in fact with us today. We're going to be talking to her about her roller coaster life and her book, Left on 10th, a Second Chance at Life. And also, John Speckford, I was listening to him with you just earlier. He's going to come to us after the inflation figures are released. See if it's as's grim as he predicted. Kiyoda, Lynn. Now hundreds of young people will be out on the weekend helping to clean graves of returned servicemen in readiness for Anzac Day. The work has been done on behalf of the New Zealand Remembrance Army, a volunteer group set up five years ago to restore and maintain war graves. Simon, Strom Bom is the group's founder, Kiora Simon. What's planned for the weekend? We've been working with student volunteer army and with the health of sponsorship from A&P. We've got around about 400 kids in about 30 locations around New Zealand. We're just doing a general tidy-ups with the war graves. But at the same time, obviously, remembering those in their family or just those that they're cleaning and keeping the generations alive with the spirit of antsy. Awesome. And Simon, just how neglected were Wargraves before your group got involved? When we started, there was, we've done about 90,000 today, but not only do we clean them, we tell the stories, and we've done about 3,000 today, but not only do we clean them, we tell the stories, and we've done about 3,500 stories of all the servicemen around New Zealand and servicemen, and we've found some fascinating stories across the country. Now, pretty shameful that these graves of these servicemen and women are neglected. Now, the work on the graves takes place mainly in the public cemeteries owned by councils. How do they react to your mahi? It's very mixed. It tends to be the larger the council, the more kind of process and procedure they make us jump through. Some of them make us jump through stuff that's virtually just destroys volunteerism. They make it absolutely impossible. They're always bringing on about us trying to locate the relatives, but we do do that, but we only get hits about one and 25 times. We had a classic situation where we had to find Smith, Jones, and White in a cemetery, and, needless to say, we never found out of those families. Yes, anyone, how can they contact you if they want to know if their gravers, their far-nosed grave has been tended to? Well, we've got to speak to our Facebook site. It's New Zealand Remembrance Army. We put all our restorations and stories up on that. And we update people where we're working around New Zealand. You know, we've got teams very active right across the country. How do you fund this work, Simon? It's a combination. A&P have been incredibly generous this year, and they've given us a large amount that's allowed us to do 16 unmarked graves across New Zealand, which is fantastic, and a lot of those are being unveiled this weekend. We also funded by RSAs, by various Ramfurley Trust has given us money and also private donations. We put a give a little up for help as well. It does cost money, particularly with travel, and when we're doing remote sites and also just consumables, but we're also sponsored by Rizene and Bioshield, who are fantastic. Oh, hi-or for your time this morning. That is Simon Strombaum, the group, the Remembrance Army Group's founder. Now back to our interview on the science of predicting an eruption, which we unfortunately lost abruptly a little bit earlier on. Groundbreaking research by the universities of Canterbury, Auckland and Brussels has been published in the International Journal Nature Communications. Now, joining us to discuss this as senior lecturer in civil and natural resources engineering at Canterbury University. Dr David Dempsey, good morning. We've got you back there, David. Yeah, morning again, should be better this time. Yeah, very good. Okay, so you have come up with some sort of a way of assessing the patterns of the seismic activity around volcanoes that can give you some insight? Tell us a bit more. Yeah, that's right. So we've looked at six volcanoes, 18 eruptions in total, about 40 years' worth of data. And because of the sheer volume there, we've had to apply a few artificial intelligence techniques that are really good at just uncovering hidden patterns. And probably the major one we've determined is this increase in a quantity called displacement seismic amplitude ratio in the days and weeks leading up to eruptions at Fikari, and to an extent Rupehu and Tongarero as well. And what this is showing us is slow pressurization of the shallow groundwater in the system. This sets up the conditions for an explosion to occur. And so what we're suggesting is that if we watch for the signal in real time, we may not be able to predict an eruption, but we can start to construct a short-term forecast, a bit like a weather forecast, which might give you the odds on a given day or a given week for an eruption to occur. Right, so that would have some implications for alert levels, which are currently used? That's a bit further down the track. The best way to look at this is another tool available to scientists and decision makers. When they are deciding, is it safe to access a volcano, what activities should be permitted around it. But yeah, we think in the end it could be another contributor, just a better understanding of the volcano, the likelihood of an eruption and when it's safe to be around them. Yeah, I mean, it's a slightly fraught scary business for scientists, isn't it? Because I know there was a case in Italy, wasn't there around earthquakes, if you try and predict them and then you don't predict them, you can do all sorts of trouble. Yeah, it's really challenging. We certainly try and stay away from the word predict and prefer forecast, because it's sort of, it has the connotation of uncertainty, and you'll never have full certainty with this kind of science. The best you can ask for is over the long term some reasonable constraint on the odds. So, for example, maybe like a one in ten chance of eruption over a period of the next week if things are looking very active at the moment, or maybe in the base case when things are a bit more settled, it might be something like one in a thousand chance over a year. None of those rules in or rules out the possibility of an eruption, but they do provide information that decision makers can work with. So what's the next step here just finally? What would you like to see? At this stage, we're still coming near the end of testing of these systems. We've been trialing something for about two years, looking at what it does in terms of false alarm rate, that kind of thing. And that testing is critical, I think, if you ever want to see these sorts of systems operationalised. So probably the next step for us is to start talking with the parties who might eventually end up using tools like these and seeing in what manner they would sort of slot into the current system. Good stuff. Hey, thank you very much for that. Dr David Dempsey there from the senior lecturer in Civil and Natural Resources at the Canterbury University. Right, the disease myrtle rust has been found on Chatham Islands where unusually it's expected to actually do more good than harm. Myrtle rust affects plants in the Myrtle family, including iconic New Zealand species such as Bahutakawa, but experts believe there are no endemic plants of that species on the islands, and the Myrtle rust is instead wrecking havoc on an unwanted weed. Here to explain is the Associate Professor at the School of Environment and Animal Science at Unitech, Dr Peter DeLang, who's also a researcher with the Beyond Mertal Rust Program. Good morning. Good morning. So, there's a silver lining in this, isn't it? Yeah, it's one of those odd situations. I don't want to downplay the fact that Ostripusinia, which causes the Myrtle Rust disease we see, is a serious threat to the main islands of New Zealand and the native myrtles that occur here and those that are planted. But on the Chathams, it's a bit different. We're not convinced that there's anything, any, any myrtles out there that are actually native to the island, possibly Manuka, but even there, we're not 100% sure. But what we are seeing out there is an introduced weed. I think called cranberry. It's not a cranberry. It's a proper name as Chilean guava. It comes from Chile. And it likes to grow in peat, which, of course, Chatham's is covered in peat. It's a very aggressive spreader. It was introduced there for people making jam out of fruits. And, you know, that does happen, but not on a big scale. introduced there for people making jam out of fruits. And, you know, that does happen, but not on a big scale. So myrtle rust has been picked up in that, which is quite exciting, because we haven't got a sensible way of controlling that plant. And were the islanders looking for one, a biological method of getting rid of that weed? Probably not. Environment Canterbury was in the Department of Conservation. It's a bit of a mixed blessing because, as I said, there are some people that like it because they do harvest the fruit to make jam. But what people aren't seeing is that not only is it causing havoc in the peat bogs, the natural ecosystems on the Chatham's in the associated shrubland, but it's also invading pasture. And where it invades pasture, cattle and sheep don'tubland. But it's also invading pasture. And where it invades pasture, cattle and sheep don't touch it, and it chokes out all the grass. So in the long term, if we don't find something to sort of hit it back, then it's going to be a problem for everybody. And the problem is we haven't got a sensible solution. Spraying it would be very harmful to the environment. Right. And so the people who would be affected by the Myrtle rust are likely to be those with gardens, is it, those with sort of who have brought Pahudakawa over? Yes. So there is Pahudakawa, there's eucalyptus there, which eventually will get metal rust as well. Feijoa, those kinds of things, bottle brushes. But overall, I think the price to pay for the control of a serious environmental weed is probably worth it. And let us remember that the Chatham Islands has an amazing flaw in its own right with a lot of spectacular endemic plants, which I would say as good, if not better, than flowering for Uticawa, which isn't native to the islands at all, and also potentially could be a pest in the future. Fascinating. Dr. Peter DeLang, really appreciate your time this morning, a researcher with the Beyond Mertal Rust program, as well as an associate professor at the School of Environment and Animal Science. At Unitek, it is coming up to five minutes to nine. The unmistakable Liberation Alps Mare A Mastakable sound of a samba Which for millions of people in Brazil means one thing It's party time In Rio de Janeiro All the dancing and glitter-smeared outfits of the city's fame Carnival is underway and will run for the next 10 days Having been shuffed For two years Because of Of, COVID. I'm joined by our correspondent, Philip Alecde Vec. Kiyoda, how's it going over there? Thank you, I'm fine. How has the festival been tracking? People must be excited and relieved that it's happening? Well, they feel, Brazilians feel, and especially people in Rio January, feel that normality and some type of routine is returning. You know Carnival here has always been an outlet for frustrations and a distraction from all the difficulties of daily lives. The pandemic has been very tough on Brazil. It cost almost 700,000 lives in Brazil. It has also deep in Brazil's social and economic problems. And they were already huge before. So this is an occasion to forget all of this and party. And then there's another important factor. Carnival is very important economically, especially for Rio Janeiro, not only for the Samba schools, which employ thousands of people, but also for the tourism industry and thousands of street vendors from the favelas. You have to imagine that you had one and a half million tourists in town during carnival before the pandemic. And the event and everything that comes with it moved roughly $800 million in the city. So it's not just about parting, but it's mainly about parting. Always, always. Have they had that expected influx of tourists? Pardon me? Have they had that expected influx of tourists? Pardon me? Have they had that expected influx of tourists? Well, it's hard to say, but from my experience, I'd say that there are tourists, tourism is back in town and a lot of tourists are coming this year, although there won't be the same numbers as we've seen before the pandemic. Now, the more official stadium element of carnivalas back, but the famous street parades haven't been given that authorization. Explain to us why that is. Well, you have to understand that there are always two carnivals in Rio. One takes place, as you said, in the famous sambodrimal. This is where each year two dozen samba schools compete, which is with each other for titles. This is the carnival known around the world for the decorated trucks and the half-naked samba dances. And then there's the street carnival where hundreds of thousands of people participate spontaneously on the streets of reoperating through the city, playing music, music dancing, of course, drinking a lot. And this is some kind of grassroots event organized by the so-called blockos, which are usually music groups. And this second carnival, the street carnival, the more anarchic carnival, has no authorization this year by City Hall. But it will happen anyways because Rio is Rio. And the mayor is the mayor of Rio is a huge carnival fan. And he has already said that nothing will be done to suppress the blockers. And that's, for me, that's a very typical thing for Rio. There's the law. There are the rules, and then there's reality. And then there's Kanuval. Hey, thank you so much for your time. That is Philippe Electa Vec. Sorry, Corin, I should have brought in my carnival get up for you. That's right. I'd expect of nothing less. It is two minutes to nine. We've got some feedback, Corrin. Yeah, a lot of feedback on the issue of public holidays. And Christopher Luxon's comments yesterday about scrapping Labor Day as a public holiday. He has since sort of walked that back. But this text says the self-employed can't afford another public holiday, one more day where we cannot work and our annual income goes down. Robin reckons we should remove Queen's birthday in lieu of the Matareki holiday. But on the other side, this person says it's easy to wave vague figures around Mr Lux. And my question, how do you estimate the figure? Now, the figure I think he came up with was $450 million is the cost of the public holiday. This text says it's disingenuous to say bad for small business. Cafe retail, thrive on holiday traffic. Surely, when he was head of Air New Zealand, public holidays would have been great for airlines, surely. David says, vote national and get rid of Labor Day, a real vote won in. And finally, this business owner texted in. I operate a nine-day fortnight for my staff and extra 21 days off the year to allow them to be human, not workers, have noticed an increase in productivity, engagement and enjoyment of work. Highly recommend the whole New Zealand economy modernises out of neoliberal thinking. Now speaking of public hos, were you saying that Anzac Day is coming up and you've got a role there, have you? Yeah, yeah, we've got Anzac Day commemorations on Monday. We've got our dawn ceremony and the 11 o'clock ceremony. I'll be hosting that from Pukiaou National Park in Wellington from the very early time of 5am so just a bit earlier I'll get up for an early morning surf to honour inzac day and then go to our service. And Dave. Thanks for having me, Coram. We'll be back tomorrow. Lovely to have you. Hey kornah, keapaito kautau. The grey teal."}
